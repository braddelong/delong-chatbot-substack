oy Edroso Breaks It Down

Have a Cold War liberal Christmas!

Here we are in A Christmas Carol season. Regular readers know Ia€™ m partial to the Alastair Sim 
version a€” the hammy Victorianism of it suits me (and, I think, Dickens) right down to the ground. 
But some of the other versions have their charms and sidelights to throw on that grand moral fable 
of recalcitrance and redemption. A friend tipped me to
the relatively obscure 1964 Rod Serling versiona€!

Noah Smith: Techno-optimism for 2023: 'Techno-optimist.... 2020 happened.... Cutting-edge 
technology... near-miraculous vaccines and treatments.... Climate change suddenly appear solvable, 
thanks to a near-miraculous explosion in green energy tech  I see lots of technological 
developments that are either changing our world in major ways already, or

seem likely to change it soon.... The A.I. breakout.... Co-authorship is exactly the right model 
for what a lot of human beings are going to be doing with these new AI tools.... The key reason to 
be optimistic about AI is that it isna€™ t slowing down.  If it extends the powers of our minds the 
way physical technology extended the powers of our bodies,

another productivity boom is probably ahead. The energy revolution rolls onward.... The solar 
revolution is going from theoretical to actual.... This is exactly what people who looked at the 
solar cost curve were predicting for years.... The strange biotech boom.... The big advances are 
happening in a bunch of different directions.  These are just three

particularly exciting areas of technological progress. There are others...

Simon Kennedy: Wages in Crosshairs: a€~The pivotal question for Fed officials is whether the climb 
in US pay over the past 18 months or so is a one-time bump a€” as companies adjust to scarce labor 
supply, and a realization that their workforce was under-compensated a€” or a pernicious feedback 
loop in which prices and wages drive each other up.
The signs are that theya€™re not willing to take any chancesa€!

Tej Parikh: Ricardo Reis: a€~Central banks must balance bringing inflation down without breaking 
thingsa€™: a€~We had a lot of very bad shocks together with a few missed judgment calls on the part 
of central banksa€! surprised by the speed of the recovery from the pandemic, the supply chain 
disruptions and the energy crisis, whilea€! not paying
enough attention to inflation expectations data. This meant that inflation rose more and was more 
permanent than what it might have beena€!. A theorist of monetary policy who is thinking about 
economic mechanisms saw a lot of red flags and worried that the 5 per cent would persist. Empirics 
is wonderful when wea€™ re in a stable and steady regime;
theory is what you need when you have big shocks and possible regime changesa€!. The big forecast 
errors of a€oeteam transitorya€n 18 months ago seemed to come from putting too much emphasis on 
micro data and so mistaking the forest for the treesa€!. If we had raised rates earlier, we 
wouldna€™ t have had so much inflation nowa€!. Firms, wage
setters, price setters, speculators, professionals at banks, everyone thinks that inflation is 
going to be at 2 per cent in the medium-term. A recession was always going to happen for the 
eurozone and UK which are large net importers of energy. Therea€™ s not much that central banks 
could do about thata€!. Then, later, as inflation comes down close to 2 per
cent, are there good reasons to ask whethera€! [we should] have an inflation target of 3 per cent? 
The answer is probably yesa€!. Credibility is not tarnished because longer-term inflation 
expectations are anchored.a€! The recession of next year is caused by Putina€™ s invasion of 
Ukrainea€!

Tom Nichols: Zelensky Knows the Clock Is Ticking: a€~The real question, though, is whether anything 
Zelensky can say will matter to a Republican Party that has decided to torment the ghost of Ronald 
Reagan by taking sides with a neo-imperial Soviet nostalgist.  Rank-and-file Republicans support 
aiding Ukraine against Russia. But the Trumpian

GOP is now controlled by its fringe, the same activists and primary voters who wear the a€oela€™ d 
rather be a Russian than a Democrat" T-shirts.  Republicans performing for their base are unlikely 
to change their views now. But Zelensky is about to speak to all of America, and his presence in 
Washington will help remind people that this is not some

esoteric foreign-policy tangle, but a brutal, bloody human contest between democracy and 
authoritarianism. His presence in front of a divided Congress mighta€”at least, we can hopea€”help 
Americans ignore the cartoonish objections of right-wing pundits.... The war in Ukraine is not 
over...
