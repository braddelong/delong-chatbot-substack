Reservea€™ s target of 2 percent.[1] The jump was caused by strong consumer demand and a number of 
supply disruptions. The Fed, which eased policy in the 2020 recession, is signaling a 
gradualtighteningthis year, and it stands ready to tighten more rapidlyif needed. Over the
next couple of years, inflation will move down, but probably not all the way to 2 percent. A key 
question for 2023 is whether the Fed should try to weaken the economy to eliminate any lingering 
excess inflation. Abundant evidence over the past two decades shows that the 2 percent target keeps 
unemployment excessively high. The Fed should raise its target to 3 percenta€!

An Interview with Emily Stewart of Vox.com:

Emily Stewart: In broad strokes, how do you tell the inflation story to yourself right now? Whata€™ 
s happening? What's going to happen going forward? What's going on?

Brad DeLong: First, because of the plague we have decided to spend about 15% more money buying 
goods, and about 5% less money buying services. In addition, there were the disruptions of the high 
plague years which pushed down incomes some and pushed down spending a lot as everyone decided they 
needed much more money in their bank accounts, for God alone knew what would happen next. It looks 
like our normal will have more people making goods, and
fewer people making services. That means that we want to pull into the goods-producing industries 
people re-entering the labor market and people producing in service industries likely to have 
excess supply. That requires that jobs in goods-producing industries have to look attractive, which 
means they have to pay higher wages than in the sectors we want to pull labor out of.


Our economy is not good at having people's wages actually fall. That is taken as an enormous status 
insult. So service-sector wages are going to stay the samea€”employers will not want to inflict the 
status insult on people of lowering their wages. If we are going to get the adjustment the economy 
needs to rebalance itself into a more goods-heavy configuration, wages for people in 
goods-producing industries have to rise.
In addition, the prices of things that are bottlenecked have to rise as well. That is the way the 
economy signals a bottleneck, and crowd-source the bottlenecks™ s solution: people see that there 
is money to be made by removing the bottleneck, and try various ingenious ways of doing so.

Thus wheeling the economy rapidly into what people want its new configuration to be is going to 
produce inflation. The economy wants and needs this inflation to grease its adjustment.

Were we to do something to kill off the inflations’’raise unemployment enough that no one would 
dare ask for a raiseS ”we would stop that adjustment to a more goods-heavy production configuration 
in its tracks. But we want that adjustment.

There is also a second, underlying layer to our current inflation. The world today is awash in 
savings and capital. It has been very hard to get people to undertake enough investment to soak up 
all the savings people are undertaking in such a way as to keep us at or near full employment. If 
there is not enoughinvestment tosoak up the savings, the economy responds by getting people fired 
so that their incomes drop, and their savings drop with their incomes. We do not want
that.

So in order to avoid that, the Federal Reserve has had to keep interest rates very, very low. In 
fact, it has not been able to keep them low enougha€”this is called the a€oesecular stagnationa€D 
problem, but I warn you that a€oesecular stagnationa€D is the wrong phrase for it.

In fact, given that inflation has been less than 2%/year for a decade and a half, the Federal 
Reserve has not been able to get real interest rates low enough to keep the economy at full 
employment unless it is aided by some strange bubble wave of irrational enthusiasm creating 
unproductive investments in order to soak up all the savings.
Thus we have now found out that the 2% inflation target that Alan Greenspan chose for us in the 
mid-1990s has wedged us into a very awkward position. Had Alan Greenspan known then what we know 
now, he would almost surely have settled on a 3% or a 4%, rather than a 2%, inflation target.

Thus we have our current wave of reopening and rebalancing inflation that is higher than we would 
like to see, and we also have this underlying 2%/year inflation target that looks like it is too 
low, in the sense that it keeps real interest rates from being as low as they need to go to avoid 
big problems.

That is the situation we are in. And there is, right now, a rolling debate about what should we do, 
with the inflation rate currently 7%. My answer: calm down. Our current inflation is, by and large, 
a part of a highly desirable adjustment. It is unlikely to last long. People do not expect it to 
last long. If we look out at what people are expecting in the future from 5 to10 yearsfrom now, 
theyare expecting that inflation will have quieted down. They areexpecting that the Fed will
have done its job.

Therefore my take is: Our current inflation is no cause for alarm. We should simply let the Fed do 
its job. We should watch the Fed keep inflation expectations managed. We should then see that this 
inflation truly is just temporary and transitory. And should it turn out to not be temporary and 
transitory, then it will be time for it to act.

There is also, right now, a somewhat different discussion. Yes, when you look out at the bond 
market, it expects inflation to get back to 2% per year between 5 and 10 years from now. But is 
that really what we want? Wona€™ t that leave us with the chronic problem we have had since 
2008a€”the Fed having to cut interest rates to zero, and then wishing they couldcut more? Wona€™ t 
returning toa 2%inflation target return us to our chronic underemployment secular­
stagnation problem?

Yes, it is likely that we will.

The counterargument in this debate is: a€oeBut we promised a 2%/year inflation target !a€D And it 
is bad to break promisesa€”that creates uncertainty, distrust, lack of credibility, and so forth.
Yes. We did promise.

But, given what we know now, the 2% inflation target is too low: it is not a smart target to have 
chosen.
Suppose that you have promised to act stupidly: should you then keep that promise?

I dona€™ t think so. I think the better promise to make is: we will choose what we think is the 
best policy, and stick to that policy; but if that policy turns out to be stupid, we will adjust.
The 2% inflation target is looking pretty stupid after the past 15 years.

In all of this, Jay Powell is in the hot seat.

He is a very good administrator. He is a very good bureaucrat. He is a very good listener. He is a 
very good consensus builder.
But he is not a technocrat.

He is, instead, a republican worthy.

So far his Fed policy has largely been set by Lael Brainard, assisted by the staff, whispering in 
his ear and making strong and powerful arguments. But she is not the natural kind of person whom he 
listens to. He has listened to her in the past because she has been obviously and demonstrably 
right. But what if there comes a situation when she is right, but it is not so obvious and 
demonstrable?

Biden has, I think, committed an error in choosing Powell for another term, precisely because he is 
a Republican worthy. The priorities of a Republican worthy, even a highly skilled bureaucratic 
manager and consensus builder, really are not the priorities of a Democratic administration. 
Moreover, I would argue they are not what the priorities of what a Republican administration should 
be, for I do not think Republican worthies have a very balanced and accurate view of the
world.

Emily Stewart: You mentioned at the top that, we need to look at this new economy with more of a 
goods focus and not as much service. Is there a chance that we shift back to what it was, once 
things get more normalized.

Brad DeLong: There certainly is. But I have found I actually like every restaurant having a 
take-out window. There also has been a lot of social learning about how online can be a more 
efficient substitute for bricks-and-mortar retail. Thus even within the service sector there have 
been a bunch of shifts. And not all of the shift into goods is going to be reversed.

Figuring out how much should be reversed, and what the new configuration should bea€”this is 
something that market economies are very good at. At least, they are very good at this provided you 
let them stay at full employment. Why? Because if they are not at full employment, nothing is 
making money, so nobody knows where the opportunities really are. Can the market economy actually 
do its job of figuring out where we really want people to be working, and what we
really want to have them doing? Not if we suppress the inflation needed for adjustment, and not if 
our inflation target is so low that it forces us into an economic configuration of permanent 
underemployment.

Emily Stewart: In your mind, what fixes the current inflation problem? Even if we say the baseline 
should be 3% or 4% Clearly clearly are gonna get worse before it gets better. Ukraine. Omicron in 
China. All the fun stuff here.

Brad DeLong: I think that inflation will be fixed by what fixed it after the coming of the Korean 
War. Then we had a similarly huge wheel in the economy toward making a awful lot of things that go 
boom. That turned out to be a permanent shift. The plans of NSC-68 were blue-sky hawkish fantasies 
before the start of the Korean War and then became US policy for generations: defense and related 
up from 2% to 15% of national income quickly.
So with Korean War we had this big burst of inflation, and time passed, and it went away. Wage and 
prices shifted in response to demand. Bottlenecks developed and were eliminated. Wages had to rise 
to pull people into the growing industries, and then they stopped rising because people were 
flowing into the growing industries. People aggressively figured out how to add capacity to get rid 
of bottlenecks.

Inflation only continues when people expect that they are going to get wage increases every year, 
independent of productivity, because they need those wage increases to keep up with the inflation 
they expect, and they expect inflation only because they expect wage increases. It only persists if 
you get a self-sustaining expectational cycle caused by the fact that that the inflation process 
has lost its anchor. So it is the job of the Fed to make sure the inflation process keeps its
anchor. That is what the Fed has to do. And so far, there is every sign that the Fed is doing it. 
It needs to keep doing so reassure people that it is going to keep inflation anchored.

Then our current inflation problem will simply ebb away.

Emily Stewart: Last question. Then I will let you go. When you say things like a€oekeeping 
inflation anchoredSD, what does that mean in like layman's terms?

Brad DeLong: Back in the 1970s you had unions, and unions had three-year wage contracts. This year 
the UAW would negotiate. They would think: a€oeGee, there's inflation out there. We want 6% wage 
increases for each of the next three years .SD The next year, it would be the Teamsters who were 
negotiating their contract. They would say: a€oeOh, look, the auto workers have 6% inflation 
increases in their wage increases for the next cycle. a€D And they would
demand the same.

You had pretty much everyone thinking that inflation next year would be what it is this year, plus, 
perhaps a little more. You had pretty much everybody thinking that they needed to aggressively 
bargain and plan for a price level growing along this 6, 8,10,12% per year upward kind of path. 
People hate that. It is a situation that is horrible to deal with.
But we are not there.

Jay Powell is out there. Jay Powell is saying that our long-term guide is to have inflation at 2%. 
Jay Powell is saying that, if necessary, he will pick up a brick and hit the economy on the head 
with it over and over again until that happens. Paul Volcker did that the economy in the early 
1980s. The Fed stands ready to do it againa€”if, but only if, it is necessary.

In fact, the Fed is starting to get ready to do it this afternoon. It will raise the Federal funds 
rate from the 0% it has been for almost all of the past fifteen years. Over the next year or so it 
is going to raise it up to 2%. And if that is not enough, they will raise it more. Yesterday we saw 
my old teacher Olivier. Blanchard at the PIIE writing about how between 1975 and 1983 Paul Volcker 
and company raised real interest rates not by 2% but by 13% percentage points. The DNA
of doing that is very much in the Fed.

Olivier Blanchard, who has a strong monetary dove in the early 2010s, is now relatively 
hawkisha€”he seems to be hinting at not 2% but 8%-points as the amount that might be necessary. I 
certainly do not think so. But we will see, because the Fed stands ready to do the job, even when 
it requires inflicting substantial collateral unemployment damage.

So far the bond market 100% believes that the Fed is going to do what is necessary to keep the 
inflation anchor. Right now you can go to my SubStack and look at the very second graph: what the 
bond market thinks inflation is going to be between 5 and 10 years from now. Except for panics, 
that thing has been rock solid between 2% and 2.5% for a generation. And it is still there.

Emily Stewart: Right. I think this is what I wanted to cover. I will call you if I have any 
follow-up. But thanks so much for speaking with me.

Brad DeLong: How is Vox these days?

Emily Stewart: What do you mean a€oehow is Vox?a€D?

Brad DeLong: I find myself thinking back most of a decade to then-young whippersnappers Ezra Klein, 
Melissa Bell, and Matthew Yglesiasa€”how they were going to create a journalistic institution that 
regarded its job as informing its readers. Giving them very smart stories written by smart people 
who wanted to make their readers smart by helping them understand the news in its substance and in 
its proper long-term context.


But, given what we know now, the 2% inflation target is too low: it is not a smart target to have 
chosen.

Suppose that you have promised to act stupidly: should you then keep that promise?

I dona€™ t think so. I think the better promise to make is: we will choose what we think is the 
best policy, and stick to that policy; but if that policy turns out to be stupid, we will adjust.
The 2% inflation target is looking pretty stupid after the past 15 years.

In all of this, Jay Powell is in the hot seat.

He is a very good administrator. He is a very good bureaucrat. He is a very good listener. He is a 
very good consensus builder.
But he is not a technocrat.

He is, instead, a republican worthy.

So far his Fed policy has largely been set by Lael Brainard, assisted by the staff, whispering in 
his ear and making strong and powerful arguments. But she is not the natural kind of person whom he 
listens to. He has listened to her in the past because she has been obviously and demonstrably 
right. But what if there comes a situation when she is right, but it is not so obvious and 
demonstrable?

Biden has, I think, committed an error in choosing Powell for another term, precisely because he is 
a Republican worthy. The priorities of a Republican worthy, even a highly skilled bureaucratic 
manager and consensus builder, really are not the priorities of a Democratic administration. 
Moreover, I would argue they are not what the priorities of what a Republican administration should 
be, for I do not think Republican worthies have a very balanced and accurate view of the
world.

Emily Stewart: You mentioned at the top that, we need to look at this new economy with more of a 
goods focus and not as much service. Is there a chance that we shift back to what it was, once 
things get more normalized.

Brad DeLong: There certainly is. But I have found I actually like every restaurant having a 
take-out window. There also has been a lot of social learning about how online can be a more 
efficient substitute for bricks-and-mortar retail. Thus even within the service sector there have 
been a bunch of shifts. And not all of the shift into goods is going to be reversed.

Figuring out how much should be reversed, and what the new configuration should bea€”this is 
something that market economies are very good at. At least, they are very good at this provided you 
let them stay at full employment. Why? Because if they are not at full employment, nothing is 
making money, so nobody knows where the opportunities really are. Can the market economy actually 
do its job of figuring out where we really want people to be working, and what we
really want to have them doing? Not if we suppress the inflation needed for adjustment, and not if 
our inflation target is so low that it forces us into an economic configuration of permanent 
underemployment.

Emily Stewart: In your mind, what fixes the current inflation problem? Even if we say the baseline 
should be 3% or 4% Clearly clearly are gonna get worse before it gets better. Ukraine. Omicron in 
China. All the fun stuff here.

Brad DeLong: I think that inflation will be fixed by what fixed it after the coming of the Korean 
War. Then we had a similarly huge wheel in the economy toward making a awful lot of things that go 
boom. That turned out to be a permanent shift. The plans of NSC-68 were blue-sky hawkish fantasies 
before the start of the Korean War and then became US policy for generations: defense and related 
up from 2% to 15% of national income quickly.
So with Korean War we had this big burst of inflation, and time passed, and it went away. Wage and 
prices shifted in response to demand. Bottlenecks developed and were eliminated. Wages had to rise 
to pull people into the growing industries, and then they stopped rising because people were 
flowing into the growing industries. People aggressively figured out how to add capacity to get rid 
of bottlenecks.

Inflation only continues when people expect that they are going to get wage increases every year, 
independent of productivity, because they need those wage increases to keep up with the inflation 
they expect, and they expect inflation only because they expect wage increases. It only persists if 
you get a self-sustaining expectational cycle caused by the fact that that the inflation process 
has lost its anchor. So it is the job of the Fed to make sure the inflation process keeps its
anchor. That is what the Fed has to do. And so far, there is every sign that the Fed is doing it. 
It needs to keep doing so reassure people that it is going to keep inflation anchored.

Then our current inflation problem will simply ebb away.

Emily Stewart: Last question. Then I will let you go. When you say things like a€oekeeping 
inflation anchoreda€D, what does that mean in like layman's terms?

Brad DeLong: Back in the 1970s you had unions, and unions had three-year wage contracts. This year 
the UAW would negotiate. They would think: a€oeGee, there's inflation out there. We want 6% wage 
increases for each of the next three years.a€D The next year, it would be the Teamsters who were 
negotiating their contract. They would say: a€oeOh, look, the auto workers have 6% inflation 
increases in their wage increases for the next cycle. a€D And they would
demand the same.

You had pretty much everyone thinking that inflation next year would be what it is this year, plus, 
perhaps a little more. You had pretty much everybody thinking that they needed to aggressively 
bargain and plan for a price level growing along this 6, 8,10,12% per year upward kind of path. 
People hate that. It is a situation that is horrible to deal with.
But we are not there.

Jay Powell is out there. Jay Powell is saying that our long-term guide is to have inflation at 2%. 
Jay Powell is saying that, if necessary, he will pick up a brick and hit the economy on the head 
with it over and over again until that happens. Paul Volcker did that the economy in the early 
1980s. The Fed stands ready to do it againa€”if, but only if, it is necessary.

In fact, the Fed is starting to get ready to do it this afternoon. It will raise the Federal funds 
rate from the 0% it has been for almost all of the past fifteen years. Over the next year or so it 
is going to raise it up to 2%. And if that is not enough, they will raise it more. Yesterday we saw 
my old teacher Olivier. Blanchard at the PIIE writing about how between 1975 and 1983 Paul Volcker 
and company raised real interest rates not by 2% but by 13% percentage points. The DNA
of doing that is very much in the Fed.

Olivier Blanchard, who has a strong monetary dove in the early 2010s, is now relatively 
hawkisha€”he seems to be hinting at not 2% but 8%-points as the amount that might be necessary. I 
certainly do not think so. But we will see, because the Fed stands ready to do the job, even when 
it requires inflicting substantial collateral unemployment damage.

So far the bond market 100% believes that the Fed is going to do what is necessary to keep the 
inflation anchor. Right now you can go to my SubStack and look at the very second graph: what the 
bond market thinks inflation is going to be between 5 and 10 years from now. Except for panics, 
that thing has been rock solid between 2% and 2.5% for a generation. And it is still there.

Emily Stewart: Right. I think this is what I wanted to cover. I will call you if I have any 
follow-up. But thanks so much for speaking with me.

Brad DeLong: How is Vox these days?

Emily Stewart: What do you mean a€oehow is Vox?a€D?

Brad DeLong: I find myself thinking back most of a decade to then-young whippersnappers Ezra Klein, 
Melissa Bell, and Matthew Yglesiasa€”how they were going to create a journalistic institution that 
regarded its job as informing its readers. Giving them very smart stories written by smart people 
who wanted to make their readers smart by helping them understand the news in its substance and in 
its proper long-term context.

A pushback against Maggie Haberman-style journalism, where every single story has to tell you that 
Jared and Ivanka are horrified at this and are working diligently to save us all. A pushback to 
clickbait, to putting the actual a€oewhata€™ s going ona€D paragraph next to last. Journalists who 
who worked for their readers and wanted to be trusted information intermediaries for readers 
willing to learn and think and be trusted information intermediaries, as opposed to
working for their sources, their editors, their advertisers, of for the LULZ of scaring the shit 
out of old people so they could glue their eyeballs to the screen and sell them ads for overpriced 
gold funds and fake diabetes cures.

How is all of that going now?

Emily Stewart: I speak only for myself personally. I don't do super-insidery journalism. It's just 
not me. I'm not Matt or Ezra. They are all very talented. They're obviously not here anymore. I'm 
not as wonky as they are, nor do I pretend to be. My goal for my readers is that you don't have to 
be an economist to understand what I'm talking about. You don't have to be on Twitter to follow 
everything. That is where I land in this. I am not clickbaity. Everybody is different. They
have their own style.

The way I think about my work is that I like covering smaller, niche parts of the economy. I am 
just not able to do that right now.

My goal is to try to be fair. Vox obviously has a reputation for being a bit left-leaning. The idea 
is to be fair and to help people understand what is going on.

Right now we are in a moment in the economy where people are genuinely confused. If you are a 
regular person, you go to the gas pump, you go to the grocery store, and you are: what in the world 
is going on? It is scary. My goal lately is to try to help people understand what is going on.
My feeling is that a few months ago everybody, myself included, was brushing off the inflation 
stuff. It does feel scary to people at this moment, what with Russia, the USA, and China. It is 
hard to understand what is even in the U.S. governments™ s control at this point.

That is, I think, what we are trying to do a little bit of here. Ezra is at the New York Times now. 
Matt is at SubStack. Dylan Matthews is still here, out of the original ones. There is a little bit 
more of a diverse staff, which I think is very healthy.

Brad DeLong: Yes. Vox today is not a selection of relatively young white guys who would have worked 
for the Marty Peretz-era New Republic, if they had not had their stomacha€™ s turned by the idea of 
having to kind of cater to PeretzS™ s bigotries.

Emily Stewart: Yeah, I think like that I do you think is a little bit different now, you know, in a 
positive way, that we have like a little bit more different viewpoints than I think, beginning 
everybody nodding with themselves by any other. But yeah, I mean, it's still like the same DNA 
still the cleaners? Yeah.

Brad DeLong: I think that the explainer stuff ought to win in the long run. But a€ceoughta€D does 
not imply a€ceisa€D.

If I were writing your inflation story, I would say: look, economists are taking history and then 
crystalizing it into theoriesa€’’turning it into the equivalent of intellectual meth. The 
underlying histories are the Korean War episode, a structural rebalancing episode that then died 
away, on the one hand and then the 1970s on the other. The hope is that this will be like the 
Korean Wa inflation experience. The fear is that it will be like the 70s and then the early 80s, 
ending in the
Volcker disinflation. Everyone's argument is ultimately based on those two historical episodes. 
People clothe their conclusions in robes of theory. But these theories were built to explain those 
particular historical episodes.

Emily Stewart: You are really helpful. Thanks so much. I hope to speak more in the future. And if 
you have anything interesting you want to talk to me about, let me know.

Brad DeLong: All right. Sure. Thanks.

Emily Stewart: Goodbye.
