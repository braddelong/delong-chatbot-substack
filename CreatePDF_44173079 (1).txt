I haven't had a chance to see the famous video from
Straumli Realm, except as an evocation. (My only
gateway onto the Net is very expensive.) Is it true
that humans have six legs? I wasn't sure from the


Key Insights:

1. Matt Suandia€”forced off of his India RCT development-economics project by the CO VID 
plaguea€”has taken the plague year to write a brilliant paper: Matthew Suandi: Promoting to 
Opportunity: Evidence and Implications from the U.S. Submarine Service

2. In the early stages of the Pacific War, whether a US submarine-launched torpedo exploded was a 
matter of luck.

3. If a submarine captain had an enlisted man marked out for promotion, those promotions happened 
much more often if the submarine returned from its cruise having succeeded in sinking ships.

4. Those promoted because they happened to be on lucky submarines with torpedoes that exploded 
lived 2.4 years longer than their counterparts who happened to be on unlucky submarines and were 
not promoted.

5. Those promoted because they happened to be on lucky submarines with torpedoes that exploded are 
recorded as having a last known address in a zip code with housing prices higher by 7 percentiles 
than their counterparts who happened to be on unlucky submarines and were not promoted.

6. Early promotion to a job with more responsibility and scopea€”at least in the WWII-era 
USNa€”shapes your life to a remarkable degree by giving you scope to develop and exercise your 
talents.

7. If the WWII-era USN is typical, we waste huge amounts of human potential by not giving people 
workplace opportunities to show what they can learn to do.

8. Equality isna€™ t just about money: it is about scope for action, about developing and 
exercising talents, and about receiving external validation.

9. A good society would give people much more opportunity to discover how big a deal they are and 
can become, and remind them of this at every opportunity.

10. It is very, very important to conduct realistic live-fire tests under realistic conditions

11. Hexapodia!
