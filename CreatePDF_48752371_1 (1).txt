a€oeSlouching Towards Utopiaa€d, cont.:

My principal aim with this a€~Stack over the next six months is to flog my book.

So here are Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the 20th Century, forthcoming from 
Basic Books on September 6,2022 <https://bit.ly/3pP3Krk>; 97th-98th sentences, with commentary:

It is in hopes of transcending the nonsense to glimpse the world aright that Ia€™ ve written this 
grand narrative. It is in that spirit that I declare unhesitatingly that the most consequent thread 
through all this history [from 1870 to 2010] was the economic.

In short, if you are to understand anything at all about the history of the long 20th centurya€”if 
your .thoughts are to be even somewhat coherent, and somewhere in the neighborhood of what a much 
vaster scrutinizing intelligence might call "the truth", you have to start from the premise that 
the axis around which history revolved from 1870-2010 was that of .the economic trends, events,
patterns, and transformations that rocked the world, not once, but every single generation again 
and again and again. Moreover, you have to hold tight to the true knowledge that the long 20th 
century was the first century in which this was true. In all previous centuriesa€”with the partial 
exception of 1770-1870a€’’the economic side was the painted backdrop in front of which the play 
proceeded,
with the economy becoming a protagonist in history only when we stepped back from any 
single-century perspective and took the millennial perspective of the longue durAOe.

The British Industrial Revolution century was a partiala€”a very partiala€’’exception to this.

In the radius-300 miles "Dover Circle" and its offshoot economies, by 1870 humanity's discovered, 
developed, deployed, and diffused technological prowess stood at 2.5 times its level of 1770. By 
1870, in the "Dover Circle" plus offshoots, roughly and approximately, on average what it had taken 
250 workers to do in 1770 it took only 100 workers to do in 1870. That economic change had
upended society, culture, and politics within the "Dover Circle" (plus offshoots). But it had only 
done so once. And it had taken 100 years. After 1870, that much economic creative-destruction 
upending everything else would take place every generation.

And if we step outside the 300-mile radius Dover Circle, and look at the world as a whole? For the 
world as a whole, humanity's deployed technological prowess was only some 3/5 higher than it had 
been in 1770:

That was certainly enough to shake thrones and altars and shift patterns of authority, hierarchy, 
coordination, and gift- and market-exchange. But outside the Dover Circle, the meat and fish of 
history over 1770-1870 remained the dance of culture, society war, conquest, and politics, with the 
economic being the scene-backdrop, and arranging the furniture on stage, before and as the actors 
entered
and the play of history began.

Paragraphs:

Ben Thompson: Mr. CISC vs. Mr. RISC, ARM & AMD Threats, Gelsingera€™ s Three Tenets'. 
a€~Gelsingera€™ s tenets also explain the strategy that I laid out on Tuesday: Intel is not 
abandoning x86; it remains the biggest differentiator the company has. Intel appears to be shifting 
some amount of fabrication for its fastest chips to TSMCa€™ s most cutting edge 3nm process. This 
puts the
company back on the bleeding edge of Moorea€™ s Law (and ahead of AMD). Intel is making its x86 IP 
available to chip designers who use Intel Foundry Services so that they can design custom chips 
that retain full software compatibility with their current infrastructure. Here is the key thing to 
understand: Gelsinger may have made his name designing chips, but from the very beginning his
view                                                                                                
                                                                            of the world has been 
rooted in a belief in the importance and power of software to create and differentiate the 
ecosystems built on top of those chips; that means that when it comes to making the hard decisions, 
I fully expect him to prioritize software over hardware. In the case of Intel, that means 
prioritizing x86 and Intela€™ s designs over his companya€™ s manufacturing, even if it is
the latter that have culturally dominated Intela€™ s decision-making for many yearsa€!

Steven Falk: New Lakewood, 1967'. a€~Lakewood followed Levittown as one of the first 
production-line communities in the United States. Developers Louis Boyar, Mark Taper, and Ben 
Weingart introduced efficient just-in-time assembly-line processes to the labor-intensive 
construction business, and the result was rock bottom prices. A two-bedroom house was just $7,575. 
Three bedrooms
cost barely fifteen hundred dollars more, at $9,075. Veterans werena€™ t required to make a down 
payment, and the non-veteran deposit was only $695. In the 1950s, the payment on a 30-year loan for 
any and every Lakewood house was about $50 a month. Adjusting for inflation, these brand-new 
California homes a€“ each with oak floors, stainless steel kitchen counters, garbage disposal, a
reasonably-sized back yard, and a sapling tree plugged into a small grass lawn facing a brand-new 
street a€“ sold for less than $100,000 in todaya€™ s dollars. Ita€™ s no wonder that 200,000 people 
visited the sales office in the first few weeks it was opena€!

Sahil Bloom: How to Retain What You Learn’. a€~Ita€™ s not enough to simply learn morea€”you have 
to retain more of what you learn. So to recap, my framework for better retention: Inspired 
Consumption: Inspired consumption is when you feel genuinely pulled to consumea€”when you enjoy the 
consumption process. Put ego aside and "quita€D more books (or content) when that
genuine inspiration fades. Unstructured Note-Taking: Take unstructured notes of novel insights, key 
ideas, or things that caused a reaction. Consolidation: Zoom out and consolidate your unstructured 
notes across key themes, insights, or ideas. Analogize: Take your newly-learned information and 
place it within your broader mental maps. Make clear comparisons and connections between
newly-learned and existing information. Idea Exercise: Use Spaced Repetition and other methods to 
exercise your new learnings and prevent atrophy. Give this framework a shot and let me know how it 
works for you!a€!
