FIRST: My Grand Narrative in a€oeSlouching Towards Utopiaa€d: Snippets of Text, with Commentary:

The paragraphs of my Slouching Towards Utopia <https://bit.ly/3pP3Krk> that set out what my Grand 
Narrative thread is. With commentary. The passage begins:
[Myy story] naturally starts in 1870.

A short reminder to readers of the start date.


I believe it naturally stops in 2010.

A short sentence to remind readers of the end date.

As the genius Dr. Jekyll-like Austro-English-Chicagoan moral philosopher Friedrich August von Hayek 
observed, the market economy massively and successfully crowdsourcesa€’’incentivizes and 
coordinates at thegrassrootsa€’’solutions to the problems it setsa€!
Introducing two supporting characters: the market economy with its extraordinary power to 
grassroots-crowdsource powerful solutions to the problems it is set, and its principal 20th century 
theoretician, the good genius Dr. Jekyll-side of Prof. Dr. Friedrich August von Hayek.

Back before 1870 humanity, given its population, did not have the technologies or the organizations 
to allow a market economy to pose the problem of how to make humanity rich.

However, back before 1870 humanity did not have the technologiesa€’’either the technologies of 
manipulating nature or the technologies of organizing humansa€”in either the level amount or the 
rate of growth for the market economy to be set the problem of moving humanity out of the realm of 
necessity in which it was trapped, the realm of dire Malthusian poverty.

So even though humanity had had market economies, or at least market sectors within its economies, 
for thousands of years before 1870, all that markets could do was to find customers for producers 
of luxuries and conveniences, and make the lives of the rich luxurious and of the middle class 
convenient and comfortable.

Hence before 1870 market sectors, and market economies, had merely turned their crowd-sourcing 
energies to making luxurious for the rich and conveniences to make the (small) middle-class 
comfortable. (Remember! The a€cemiddle classa€D is not the median 50th percentile! The a€oemiddle 
classa€D are, in previous centuries, those who are not rich but who do not fear starvation should 
the Wheel of Fortune take even a minor adverse turn!)
Things changed starting around 1870.

Another short sentence for the sake of rhetoric, attempting to hammer into readers the idea that 
1870 and its triplea€”the coming of globalization, of the industrial research lab, and the modern 
corporation^”in a strong and powerful sense marked the end of all previous human history.

Then [in 1870] we got the institutions for organization and research and the technologiesa€”we got 
full globalization, the industrial research laboratory, and the modern corporation.

The coming of all three of these more or less at once was a truly mighty change. It rationalized 
and routinized the discovery and development and the development and deployment and not just the 
local but the global deployment of technological advances. The coming of all these three more than 
quadrupled the pace at which humanitya€™ s technological empire was increasing. And that step-up in 
the growth rate lasted from 1870 to 2010.

Were those three changes baked in the cake by what had come before? Are they best thought of as 
slow, evolutionary advances that one would naturally have expected to follow from the course of the 
Industrial Revolution up to 1870? Alfred D. Chandler says: probably not. His "Scale and Scope" 
makes powerful arguments that the creativity that produced the modern corporation, and the 
industrial research labs that served it, were results of the particular
historical situation and of accidents that happened in the U.S. after the Civil War, After all, no 
similar developments took place in France or Britain.

I tend to see industry-oriented universal banks as a key intermediary: those emerged in the U.S. 
and in Germany, so it was not a unique event. But they did not emerge elsewhere. So it was a rare 
event. This, however, carries me far away from my main thread.

These were the keys.

Again: a very short sentence to rhetorically hammer home the point that this 1870 triple of the 
industrial research lab, the modern corporation, and full (not just fledgling) globalization was 
really really important.

These unlocked the gate that had previously kept humanity in dire poverty.

Another short sentence, driving home the point. Without this triple of industrial research lab, 
modern corporation, and full globalization, we might well have been doomed. We might well have been 
doomed by slow productivity growth, by our fecundity, and by the patriarchy that made becoming the 
mother of at least one son who survived to adulthood nearly the.only source of significant social 
power for female members of homo sapiens sapiensa€”to

Malthusian or near-Malthusian poverty.

These unlocked the gate that had previously kept humanity in dire povertya€!

Without this triple, we had been doomeda€”by slow productivity growth, by our fecundity, and by the 
patriarchy that made becoming the mother of at least one son who survived to adulthood nearly the 
only source of significant social power for female members of homo sapiens sapiensa€.”to Malthusian 
or near-Malthusian poverty. With this triple, and with the more-than-quadrupling of the pace of 
proportional growth of humanity's deployed technological
prowess that it drove, we had the possibility of escape, into a realm where we could for the first 
time build a truly human world.

The problem of making humanity rich could now be posed to the market economy, because it now had a 
solution.

The extraordinary more-than-quadrupling of the pace of human .technological progress deployed into 
the world economy allowed the market to turn its energies to doing more than making the lives of 
the rich luxurious and providing conveniences for the middle class.

On the other side of the gate, the trail to utopia came into view.

It was Malthusian poverty that had kept humanity from building its utopia or utopias before 1870. 
But with the coming of the rapid 2% per year technological progress of modern economic growth, that 
blockage to sprinting or running or marching humanity to utopia was removed. With the deployed 
technological prowess in manipulating nature and organizing humans doubling every 35 years starting 
in 1870, humanity's problem was merely to decide,
deliberately, consensually, and thoughtfully, which utopia or utopias we should build for our 
descendants, right? right?

And everything else good should have followed from that.

And yet it did not. We did not race or jog or even walk toward utopia. At best, we slouched. 
Sometimes.

Paragraphs:

If you are going to distract attention from the distribution of income as a problem to be solved by 
government, you have to focus attention on some other problema€”and some other problem on which a 
large chunk of the activists on the other side of distribution-of-income questions can be pushed 
into being the smaller part, or at least the weaker part, of the (s)electorate. This has long been 
loan. But what makes our age different is that there is another group
added to those who want to sharpen contradictions within the people: those grifters who see money 
to be made by making some citizens absolutely terrified of their fellows:

Will the big jump given to communications technologies and their use in daily life from the Covid 
plague give a significant boost to productivity in research and development? It would be wonderful 
if it were true:

Carl Benedikt Frey: How to Escape Innovationa€™ s Great Stagnation: a€~While research inputs have 
been rising sharply, research productivity is dropping even faster. It now takes 18 times the 
number of researchers to achieve Moorea€™ s lawa€”that is, the doubling of computer chip power 
about every two yearsa€”than in the early 1970sa€!. The virtual world remains a very imperfect 
substitute for face-to-facea€!.
Videoconferencing narrows peoplea€™ s cognitive focus, which hampers idea generation. But todaya€™ 
s digital technologies are sufficiently good for researchers to be able to compensate for the 
drawbacks, making use of complementary skills and resources around the worlda€!. Harnessing the 
communications revolution for remote collaboration has also required complementary investmentsa€!. 
It can spark a revival of breakthrough
science,   faster productivity growth and, finally, the chance to escape stagnation^!

Another smart person who shares with me my perspective that the story of the long 20th century is 
now over:

Arvind Subramanian: Five Fateful Shifts that Will Shape the Future World Economy. a€~The era of 
extraordinarily cheap finance is overa€!. The era of trade hyperglobalisation is overa€!. Economic 
convergence will stalla€! [because] dynamism was propelled in large part by cheap finance and 
hyperglobalisationa€!. Weak global co-operation will dwindle furthera€i. We are destined to a 
G-minus world because of domestic
developments in the worlda€™ s two largest economiesa€!. The US is now two different nationsa€! 
internally polariseda€! a less attractive and unreliable partner for other countriesa€!. Meanwhile, 
China has become a threat to its neighbours. Xi Jinping is dashing both the possibility of China 
becoming truly rich and the hope once entertained by the world that it would become politically 
opena€!

Did I dream it, or is there actually an alternate-history story in which Karl Marx moves to New 
York (or St. Louis) in the early 1950s, and gecomes a Republican Party stalwart and a U.S. Civil 
War general?:

Richard J. Evans (2013): Marx in His Time: ^FKarl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life by Jonathan 
Sperbera€!. The problem for Marx was that his anti-Prussian campaign required the co-operation of 
left-wing liberals and democrats, while his championing of the class struggle meant turning against 
them. While Marx vacillated, the workers lost interest in the former campaign and the democrats 
were alienated by the latter. The
Prussian government recovered its nervea€!. The early 1850sa€! proved a low point for Marx 
politically, as the Communist Leaguea€! members in Cologne were arrested and subjected to a mass 
show triala€!. The exiles meanwhile accused each other of hypocrisy and embezzlement, taking each 
other to court and resorting to fisticuffsa€!. Scurrilous rumours [were] spread by German and 
Austrian police spies, who swarmed around
them like fliesa€!. Marx withdrew from politics and devoted himself to forging a new career as a 
journalist, writing articles for the New York Tribune, commissioned by an American working on the 
paper who had met him in Cologne. He published 487 articles in all, about a quarter of them 
ghostwritten by Engels when Marx was ill. They amounted to more, in sheer volume, than the sum 
total of everything else Marx published in his
lifetimea€l

The old nationalisms were both particularistic and universal: Britaina€™ s was that of the Mother 
of Parliaments, which example all others should follow; France was civilization and culture, which 
all others should follow; Italya€™ s was the heritage of Rome, which all others should revere; 
Germanya€™ s wasa€! well, there was a claim to philosophical eminence, and then a claim of 
engineering eminence, but now it is one of humanitarian remembrance of
atrocity; and so on. Americaa€™ s? It was as the worldaC™ s pioneer, exploring utopian 
possibilities, so that a€oemen shall say of succeeding plantations, a€~the Lord make it like that 
of New Englanda€™ .a€D It is true that this claim to a nationalism that is both particularistic and 
universal is a very high tightrope to walk. But what was new about Sam Francis was his explicit 
rejection of it in the name of ethno-nationalist fascism. And why? All because he
did not want African-Americans believing they were in any way his equal:

John Ganz: A Marxism for the Master Class: a€~In his 1992 essay Nationalism, Old and New, [Sam 
Francis]a€! rejects the a€oeold nationalisma€D of Hamilton and Lincoln and proposes a a€oenew 
nationalism^ □ that will replace its individualism and egalitarianism with something elsea€!. 
a€oeThe social ethic of an authentic nationalism that can summon and harness the genius of a people 
certain of its identity and its destiny. The
myth of the managerial regime that America isa€! a philosophical proposition^I must be replaced by 
a new myth of the nation as a historically and culturally unique order thata€! excludes those who 
do not or cannot assimilate to its norms and interests. This is the real meaning of a€~America 
Firsta€™ .a€Ua€! Here Francis is speaking the language of the a€oeconcrete nationalism^□ of Maurras 
and BarrA©s that emerged in Europe
towards the end of the 19th century, which differed from the a€oeold nationalism^□ of UbertA©, 
A©galitA©,fraternitA©. As the French Historian Michel Winock writes, this nationalism would 
a€oesubordinate everything to the exclusive interests of the nation, that is, the nation-state: to 
its force, its power, and its greatnessa€D and was of a much more dour tone than the old 
patriotisma€!
