FIRST: On a€~Mock-Eliminationista€ ™ Rhetoric as a Strategy of Persuasion:

The extremely sharp and wise Liam Bright is annoyed this week. (But what else is new?):

Liam Bright: a€™This: Morgan J. Freeman @mjfree: a€oeBeing a€~anti-racista€™ starts by admitting 
a€~whitenessa€™ is a diseasea€!a€D from a well-followed [260K] blue-tick account, himself white.

To put the point mildly ita€™ s not ideal messaging. But it also seems so hubristic to claim 
anti-racism requires knowing this sorta humanities talk. People have been anti-racist a long time 
without needing EdTheory degrees.

Re: the messaginga€”on its surface it so much sounds like a€oebuild up to mass murder talka€D. Of 
course people balk. And we all even know that was the point! That was how it sounded edgy and 
attention-grabbing at academic conferences. No action is intended, but ita€™ s cool to insinuate.
Really I basically think the academic humanities have vastly too much and the wrong sort of 
influence on contemporary activism. Wea€™re bad and wea€™ ve made what wea€™ ve touched worsea€!

What can one say about this, other than: a€oeOf course Liam is correct here!a€D?

The guya€”Freemana€’’tries to provoke, gets a backlash, and then feels validated in his stance as a 
defender of Woke-ness by all the abuse he gets. And so he profoundly mistakes the situation.
The right thing for him to do is to take lessons from Daniel Davies:

Daniel Davies: Rules for Contrarians: 1. Dona€™ t Whine. That Is All: a€~I like to think that I 
know a little bit about contrarianism. So Ia€™ m disturbed to see that people who are making 
roughly infinity more money than me out of the practice arena€™ t sticking to the unwritten rules 
of the gamea€!. If you start a fight, you can hardly be
surprised that youa€™re in a fight. Ita€™ s the definition of passive-aggression and really quite 
unseemly, to set out to provoke people, and then when they react passionately and defensively, to 
criticise them for not holding to your standards of a calm and rational debatea€!. If youa€™re 
writing a contrarian piece properly, you ought to be
well aware of what point it looks like youa€™ re making, because the entire point is to make a 
defensible argument which strongly resembles a controversial one. So having done this 
intentionally, you dona€™ t get to complain that people have a€cemisinterpreteda€D your piece by 
taking you to be saying exactly what you carefully
constructed the argument to look like you were sayinga€!. Contrarians ought to have thick skins, 
because their entire raison da€™ etre is the giving of intellectual offence to others. So dona€™ t 
whine, for heavena€™ s sake. Own your bullshita€!

And this is a very nice follow-up:

Charlie Stress @cstross

@lastpositivist @delong It also reflects the specifically Christian doctrine of original sin, which 
is extremely unhelpfula€”if the writer interprets everything through a religious lens they'll 
likely only be receptive to religious solutions, and blind to non-religious ones.

James Palmer @BeijingPalmer

@cstross @lastpositivist @delong was thinking exactly this, along with the follow-up that you 
can't, in this way of thinking, be saved by deeds alone but by the grace of theory. You have to 
truly accept theory into your heart.

this kinda stuff is what I mean when I talk about the kinda "empty radicalism" of non-profit types, 
lots of very confrontational, in-your-face "oh sorry was I too REAL for you?" language. in service

No Housing Please, We're a Community

I received a really interesting, insightful comment on a subscribers-only piece from a few weeks 
ago, on the tension between community and continuity on the one hand, and development and growth on 
the other. I had mentioned in passing the right-wing meme a€oel will not live in a pod,a€D which 
refers to the supposed notion that liberals want to cram everyone

SUBJECT: Where Should Policy Energy Be Focused?

Back in 2019,1 wrote:

Zack Beauchamp: A Clinton-Era Democrat Makes the Case for the Left: a€~One of the most interesting 
takes Ia€™ ve seen on this debate came from Brad DeLong, an economist at the University of 
California-Berkeley. DeLong, who served as deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic 
policy in the Clinton administration, who
is one of the market-friendly, a€oeneoliberala€n Democrats who have dominated the party for the 
last 20 years. The term he uses for himself is a€oeRubin Democrata€D a€” referring to followers of 
finance industry-friendly Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. Yet DeLong believes that the 
time of people like him running the
Democratic Party has passed. a€oeThe baton rightly passes to our colleagues on our left,a€D DeLong 
wrote. a€oeWe are still here, but it is not our time to leada€Da€l

Was this right then? Is this right now?

I think it was right then, and I think it's still Hass to be right now. The 
let's-do-sensible-center-left-policies ship sailed when Mitt Romney rejected the nationwide 
extension of his own healthcare reform plan, and win the entire Republican party went all in on 
let's-have-a-deeper-depression in 2009. The only way to make progress is to craft left-wing 
policies that are
technocratic Lee effective, and then try to rush them through in a climate of popular enthusiasm 
and mobilization. You may say: that is guaranteed to be a losing strategy. But that is wrong. It is 
likely it to be a losing strategy, but not guaranteed. And, until there emerges a non-fascist wing 
of the Republican Party that actually cares about America again (if one ever
does), other strategies are bigger losers and the country is in long-run decline.

Paragraphs:

Let me endorse what the wise Martin Sandbu says here: Our current macroeconomic configuration is a 
vastly, vastly better configuration than the economy was in back at the end of 2010,2 1/4 years 
after the start of the Great Recession. Vastly. Better. The long-term inflation anchor is 
undamaged. There has been a remarkable recovery in employment. There have
been truly gratifying gains in productivity and production. Every single Federal Reserve official 
should start every single speech with: as far as the real, productive economy is concerned, we at 
the Fed are all giving each other high-fives and taking victory laps:

Martin Sandbu: Inflation & the Economics of Belonging: a€~Supposea€! inflation is the price we are 
paying for a high-pressure demand policy, how well is that policy delivering for the price?a€! 
Productivity is significantly higher than projected before the pandemica€!. Wages are growing much 
faster among the poorest paida€!. We should
not write off Bidenomics yet, nor accept the new narrative that all a high-pressure economy brings 
is immiserising inflationa€!

Confer Karl Polanyi: The Great Transformation, on how the market economy transforms land into a 
a€oefictitious commoditya€n, and how that then powers a societal reaction against that idea. Nobody 
believes that the best use of land is the one that passes the maximum profitability test in the 
eyes of distant rootless cosmopolites. This does not mean that
NIMBYism is a sensible reaction. It is not. But it is a guide to where NIMBYism gets its energy:



Noah Smith: It Looks Like Wea€™ re Headed for a Soft Landing'. a€~Inflation probably hasna€™ t been 
around long enough this time for a belief in Fed dovishness to get entrencheda€!. Ultimately, if a 
few points of interest rate hike, some modest stock market declines, and a bit of fiscal austerity 
can quell inflation, I dona€™ t think the cost
to the real economy will be particularly high. Of course it would be best if the cost were zero, 
but in practice ita€™ s very hard to a€celanda€D an economy without overcorrecting at least a 
little bita€!. The likeliest outcome now seems to be that the excess demand created in 2021 will 
simply wheeze out of the economy like air from a

deflated balloon, leaving a modest, 2001-sized recession in its wake. Thata€™ s not the best 
possible outcome, but ita€™ s very very far from the worsta€!
