The book also knits together a century of very complicated economic, political, and social trends, which are often siloed but are in fact quite interrelated, creating a new and important narrative about where America has been, and where it may be going…. Reagan and both Bushes… Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were… all… could be described as neoliberals, in the sense that many of their economic policies were at core about unleashing (or at least not restraining) capitalism, with the underlying belief that markets would, indeed, know best….</p><p>You can’t really understand the Reagan revolution, with its dismantling of unions, deregulation, and tax-slashing, without understanding FDR’s “New Deal”…. And so, the first section of the book tackles the 1930s to the 1970s….</p><p>Gerstle does a particularly wonderful job of connecting the political and economic dots in that post 2000s era in the US, a complicated and fascinating time in which the sort of “techno-utopianism” exemplified by Friedman’s book <em>The World Is Flat</em> (2005) collided with two ill-advised wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as a Democratic party in thrall to both Wall Street and Silicon Valley… and a political narrative—we must save banks but not homeowners—that never quite added up to average voters…. Gerstle has a real genius for capturing political irony—how 1960s hippies turned into Bay Area libertarians, how increased access to credit hurt minorities most, how Democrat Jimmy Carter was a deregulator, how individual “freedom” to pursue prosperity might morph into terrible inequality and insecurity….</p><p>Some of this reckoning [with neoliberalism] is racist and xenophobic. Some of it is a necessary swinging of the economic pendulum back to a happy medium. As we wait to see where it lands, Gerstle’s history of where we’ve been is essential reading for a post-neoliberal era…</p></blockquote><p>My thoughts on Gary’s—truly excellent—book are still not ready for prime time:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Notes On Gerstle Neoliberal Order 2022 08 17 </strong>219KB ∙ PDF File <strong><a href="https://braddelong.substack.com/api/v1/file/6e537d48-68f3-4e2a-b255-583d5324db10.pdf">Download</a></strong></p></blockquote><p>I do, however, wish to stress seven points:</p><ol><li><p>Neoliberalism in the 1970s was protean—all things to all men, so that by all means it might accomplish <em>something</em>. As it took power, however, it greatly solidified. It turned out that the rock-solid core of the rising Neoliberal Order was this: the liberation of entrepreneurship and the economy from the grip of rent-seeking and bureaucracy. It was a bipartisan initiative. It started under Jimmy Carter. And it came in left-neoliberal and right-neoliberal flavors.</p></li><li><p>Left-Neoliberalism settled on getting information-technology tools to people—so that they could see opportunities and situations in ways that had previously been accessible only to the high priests of the technostructure—and utilizing the market economy was an unparalleled mechanism for crowdsourcing solutions to social problems—for markets were often the best means to social-democratic ends. Equitable growth would make everyone rich, and they could then use their wealth on the market to demand actions that would solve their life-problems (<em>a la </em>William Beveridge). Government taxes and subsidies would align what was profitable with what was socially desirable (<em>a la</em> Arthur Pigou). And full-employment policies would prevent the waste of depressions, plus give the working class social power—for in a full-employment economy labor would be very valuable—and tight-fiscal easy-money policies would keep interest rates low and mean that any remaining plutocrats could only exercise their social power by spending down their capital, and ceasing to be plutocrats (<em>a la </em>John Maynard Keynes).</p></li><li><p>What became <em><strong>hegemonic</strong></em> however, was right-neoliberalism. In large part, this was because of the positive hostility of right-neoliberals to technocratic norms: left-neoliberals would put government finances in order so that they were not distorting and damaging the workings of the market; right-neoliberals would then administer huge, unfunded tax cuts for the rich that deranged government finances; and then the cycle would repeat. But right-neoliberalism also drew on a cultural expectation that the only rights that did and should matter were property rights—that if you wanted a voice and power in society, you should first demonstrate that you were worthy and become rich. And never mind that many of the rich had been born on third base. Right-Neoliberal thus gloried in inequality and held it to be not unfortunate necessity but rather social justice itself.</p></li><li><p>For reasons I do not understand, left-neoliberals tended to slide into right-neoliberalism as they aged.</p></li><li><p>The shift from left-neoliberalism to Bidenite post-neoliberalism should not be exaggerated. Robert Kuttner is right when he writes that Biden is “closer to the New Deal, with greater public investment, more regulation, progressive taxation…” But we Clintonites’ vote count for the public-investment provisions in the 1993 Reconciliation Bill stalled out at 46 senators, just a hair less than Biden’s 50. This made a huge difference in the congressional mire. But it is not that Clinton was red and Biden is blue. Remember: it was the Clinton administration that launched U.S. v. Microsoft—and, by restraining Microsoft via litigation and threat, kept it from casting devastating shade on rising Google and Apple. Remember: the 1993 Clinton Reconciliation Bill’s EITC expansion and higher top rates moved the tax system far more in a progressive direction than anything Biden has been able, so far, to do.</p></li><li><p>The key difference between Clintonites and Bidenites is one of rhetoric: The Biden team is not on the defensive, as Clinton was, against a then-attractive right-neoliberalism, in large part because neoliberalism was <em><strong>hegemonic</strong></em> in Gerstle’s sense in the 1990s and is not today.</p></li><li><p>Hold tight to the fact that global north neoliberalism did not restore productivity growth to its pre-1975 pace, rework the system of economic distribution so that government programs provided more support to the unlucky who had strong claims on public assistance, rework the system of economic distribution so that government programs provided less support to those who were politically powerful and well-connected, reunify the western alliance behind the civilizational project of liberty and democracy, or restore moral order and discipline to rich, post-industrial societies. All it did was make the rich much richer and the non-rich somewhat poorer. Hence advocates of neoliberalism have been reduced, for nearly two decades now, to claiming that it has not failed, but rather that it was failed by unworthy standard-bearers. And that trick never works.</p></li></ol><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/recalling-rana-faroohars-review-of?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/recalling-rana-faroohars-review-of?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>EPI</strong>:<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH1Rv1aXtGQ">Not So Free to Contract: How unequal workplace power undercuts worker protections</a> </p><div id="youtube2-IH1Rv1aXtGQ" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;IH1Rv1aXtGQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IH1Rv1aXtGQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay;

Malesky</strong>: <em>Enhancing the Literature on Authoritarian Regimes through Detailed Comparisons of China and Vietnam</em>: ‘In exploring the role of factions, personalism, and legislative behavior in the two states, the three contributions in this issue dispense with the simplistic notion of a China or Vietnam “Model” of political economy, but instead explain the politics behind how leaders are chosen and how legislative decisions are made and implemented. All three are explicitly comparative, documenting clear differences between the states and showing how these matter for explaining puzzles in critical political outcomes. As I argue in this essay, the insights of these three papers are important for more than just broadening area studies expertise, but for the burgeoning literature on authoritarian regimes, which has tended to black-box countries, insufficiently accounting for subtle institutional differences and variation in the policy preferences of elite actors. In this essay, I explore the unique contributions of each article to larger debates in comparative politics. I conclude by arguing for a unified theory that can help us better understand why these systems have been so successful in good times and resilient in hard times…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://sites.duke.edu/malesky/files/2020/11/20201104_ChinaVietnam_ejm3.pdf">https://sites.duke.e du/malesky/files/2020/11/20201104_ChinaVietnam_ejm3.pdf</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Other Things Þt Went Whizzing by…</h3><h3>Very Briefly Noted:</h3><ul><li><p><em>It is not just AI-art; it is AI-words too: </em><strong>Fadeke Adegbuyi</strong>: <a href="https://every.to/cybernaut/an-ai-might-have-written-this">An AI Might Have Written This</a>: ‘Writers are using apps like Sudowrite and Subtxt to craft essays, short stories, and screenplays…</p></li><li><p><em>It looks as though China’s middle-income trap is knocking on the door: </em><strong>Robin Wigglesworth</strong>: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/97899dc5-e80d-4383-b47b-00434697a57a">China’s low-growth era</a>: ‘Is 3 per cent the new normal?…</p></li><li><p><em>A report from the globetrotter: </em><strong>Noah Smith</strong>: <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/amsterdam-some-impressions?utm_source=email">Amsterdam: some impressions</a>: ‘Travel-blogging from the perfect liberal city…n yway, my stay in Amsterdam was too short, and I hope to be back sometime.

But one should not delude himself/herself in believing that the rest of the world can just be flipped on the drop of the hat, and would not notice the enormity of the ideological change that this implies.
