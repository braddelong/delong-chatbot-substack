Paragraphs:

Trade wars are not easy to win, and they are not popular:

Kris Mitchener, Kevin Oa€™Rourke, & Kirsten Wandschneider: The Ghost of Smoot-Hawley Tells Why 
America Isna€™ttoo Big to Avoid Retaliation'. d~The US faced substantial and
widespread retaliation from trade partners in response to protectionist measures employed in the 
wake of the Great Depression. Exports to retaliating countries fell by as much as 33%d!. As Irwin
(1998:                                                                                         337) 
points out, there were three possible responses to Smoot-Hawley. The first was not to respond at 
all, but in the context of the Great Depression that might have involved raising tariffs for
purely domestic political reasons. The second was to take Smoot-Hawley as a signal that 
international cooperation had broken down, and erect tariffs as a result. And the third was to take 
doedirect
retaliatory measures against the United StatesdD. Only the last of these possibilities constituted 
retaliation per sed!. At the time, however, there was little doubt in policymakersd™ minds that

Smoot-Hawley had provoked widespread retaliationd!. We provide the first systematic quantitative 
estimates of the impact of retaliation against Smoot-Hawleyd!. Having high frequency data
allows us to exploit the differential timing of retaliatory measures when estimating the impact of 
retaliationtd!

I do not know if this is right, but it is certainly interesting. Mitch McConnell enforced party 
unity on Republican senators starting at the beginning of 2009. Perhaps the moderates among them 
have finally recognized that it
has led them to a very bad place indeed:

Cheryl Rofer: President Biden Restores Strategy To Politics'. d'President Joe Biden was a senator 
for 36 years. He has seen horse-trading. He has seen comity with segregationists. He has seen
deadlock and filibusters. He has seen bipartisanship. He has seen Newt Gingrichd™ s power grab. He 
has seen Mitch McConnelld™ s obstructionism. He knows how the Senate and the House
workd! quiet talks and promises, agreement and respect. Some of these things may even be feigned. 
But feigning respect, for example, is itself a way of showing respectd!. The old ways
decayedd! under Gingrichd™ s and his successorsd™ scorched-earth politics. Reporters who grew up 
since Gingrich do not recognize that other tactics exist. They do not recognize that

relationships are built and doubts sowed behind the scenes. They are accustomed to tantrums and 
sudden shows of power. They do not have the tools to describe the wide array of tactics Biden brings
with himd!. I think we are beginning to see results of Bidend™ s tactics. Itd™ s early, but there 
is a premium on being the first to point things out. Thirty-five House Republicans voted to form a
commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the Capitold!. A math-minded person could chart 
it! 1 yes (Romney in Impeachment #1; next time ten House members+7 Senators; now 35 House
members. Paul Ryan, former Republican Speaker of the House, is holding a fundraiser for Adam 
Kinzinger, one of the 35. That is how to move the Senate too. A few at a time. As one senator moves
(Mitt Romney), it becomes easier for othersd!. Biden is redefining bipartisanship to mean the will 
of the peopled!. Itd™ s early, and we are seeing small indicators. Things can still go badd!

Does Schumer mean it when he says doefailure is not an optiondD? Do Manchin and Sinema agree? 
Certainly they are willing to pretend that they believe that failure is not an option while Schumer 
negotiates. But will
they need to make the jump in the end, and if they need to, will they?

John Stoehr: Nearly Everyone Missed Chuck Schumer Implying This Week that the Filibustera€™s Death 
Is Coming: d'Something triggered the prevailing discoursed!. Perhaps it was the GOP
doing the most unbecoming thing of all in Washington: sticking with the loser. Whatever the reason, 
this weekd™ s punditry seems to finally recognize the nightmare for what it isd!. There are
many examples of the conventional wisdom in Washington getting triggered now for some reason 
instead of, I dunno, after an attempted coup dd™ etat. All of them, however, focus on the United
States Senate, especially Joe Manchind!. Even as I was writing the piece, something was happening 
to give us even more hoped!. Nearly everyone missed itd!. Schumer said what hed™ s been
saying                                                                                         for 
months, which is the filibuster is not going to get in the way of democracy, because democracy is 
too important. Hered™ s the quoted!. doeThese kinds of things just are abhorrent to our
democracy and we must change them, and we willd! failure is not an option and everything will be on 
the tabledidD When not if. The question, therefore, is timing. And timing is going to be
determined primarily by how the Republicans are willing to behaved!. Are the Republicans going to 
act less fascist than they have been since January 6? If the answer is yes, then the Democrats are
in a pickle. They wond™ t feel the pressure necessary for enacting sweeping democracy reforms. If 
the answer is no, thend! they are going to need the conventional wisdom in Washington to be on
their side, which is to say, conventional wisdom saying that itd™ s OK to act nakedly partisan. I 
think this past week saw the beginning of that processd!

Hunkering down like cowards in your trenches, whimpering and crying, and hoping Trump dies soon is 
neither a dignified nor a smart strategy. But it is the strategy of the overwhelming bulk of 
elected Republicans:

Kilgore Trout, Junky Horse: a€™ [The Republicansa€™ ] strategy is a€oehope he diesa€CA which makes 
for some really strange bedfellows: Allahpundit: "Trumpd™ s going to force them to
rehash 2020 anyway when hed™ s out on the trail campaigning in primaries, so what does it matter?: 
Haley Byrd Wilt: d'Thune is very upfront here about some of the concerns behind GOP
opposition  to the January 6 commission: John Thune: "[Findings] could be weaponized politically 
and drug into next year. I want our midterm message to be on the kinds of things that the American
people are dealing with: Thatd™ s jobs and wages and the economy and national security, safe 
streets and strong bordersd”not relitigating the 2020 elections. A lot of our members, and I think 
this

is true of a lot of House Republicans, want to be moving forward and not looking backward. Anything 
that gets us rehashing the 2020 elections I think is a day lost on being able to draw a contrast
between us and the Democratsd™ very radical left-wing agendad!

On the one hand, this is obviously right. On the other hand, Facebook and Foxd”and Twitterd”are 
working very hard to try to ensure that the audience we select for ourselves is a highly-toxic one. 
We could break out of it.
But that would require intelligence, energy, and effortd”and, meanwhile, Facebook, Fox, and Twitter 
will keep spending money trying to block us from doing so. So this is also obviously wrong:

Charlie Warzel: You (Yes, You!) Are Trapped in an Audience - Galaxy Brain: d'Most of us are 
conditioned not to see these dynamics in our own online experiences. I fall victim to this shallow
thinking all the time, especially on a platform like Twitter. I often take my (algorithmically 
filtered) timeline for granted as some kind of standard Twitter experience, despite the fact that 
it is curated
by,                                                                                         uh, me. 
Sure, I think a number of people are having somewhat similar experiences to me on a day-to-day 
basis (because of overlap in followers or topics of conversation) but thered™ s also a lot
more people who are experiencing a completely different internet. The doehellsitedn I complain 
about is usually a prison of my own designd!
