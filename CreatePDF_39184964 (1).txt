Key Insights:

•  There are a great many reasons to fear that the rise of industrial and post-industrial economic 
concentration is doing serious harm to the market economya€™ s (limited) ability to function as an

•  That is, the neo-Brandeisians will have their chance to the extent that they are not blocked by 
justices who know little of the law and less of economics.

• Hexapodia!
