FIRST: Sketch of a Presentation for the Book Launch Event


So, my actual post-book launch first presentation on Slouching Towards Utopia <bit.ly/3pP3Krk> is 
Wednesday morning in Washington DC: at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in 
Dupont Circle. (I have given three pre-publication dry runs: for Chris Meissner's class at UC 
Davis, for the Esteves-Sussman international macro history virtual seminar, and for the Berkeley 
Network for a New Political Economy.)
So what should I say at the actual lunch?

I figure I have 15 minutes:

1870 Was the Hinge of History:

Before 1870, slow technological progress, the necessity under patriarchy of trying to have more 
sons in the hope that at least one would survive, and natural resource scarcity—those put mankind 
under the Malthusian harrow, in dire poverty. Most social energy back then was devoted to the 
elite's (a) running a force-and-fraud, exploitation-and-domination machine, (b) elbowing other 
potential elites out of the way, and then (c) utilizing their ill-gotten gains in
building a high culture in which the non-elite were villains and churns.

After 1870, technological progress took off like a rocket. It rapidly became clear that there was a 
good chance that humanity would soon, in historical timescales, gain the technological powers to 
bake a sufficiently large economic pie that everybody could have enough.

Then, having baked a sufficiently large, Economic pie, all humanity would have to do is solve the 
second order problems of slicing the pie, and then tasting the pie a€“ utilizing our 
soon-to-be-immense collective wealth to enable people to flourish, to live lives that were safe, 
secure, healthy, and happy.


Before 1870, the road to anything one might claim as even a semi-utopia was closed. After 1870, the 
road was open.

What is that? You say that 1712 and the invention of the steam engine, not 1870, is the hinge of 
history? Maybe you are right. But I think you're probably not. Globally, economic growth from 1770 
to 1870, in the century of the steam engine, was insufficient for humanity to gain more than a few 
steps in the race between technological invention and Malthusian fertility. Over 1770 to 1860, only 
perhaps 1/3 of growth comes from technological progress proper.
The second third comes from concentrating the industry of the world in the place where 
manufacturing production is most efficient. The last third comes from the natural resource bonanza 
of extremely cheap coal because the last glaciers scraped off all the rock that had covered it. But 
the extremely cheap cold was close to gone by 1870. And you can only globalize and gain the 
efficiency benefits from concentrating manufacturing once.

Absent the technological-acceleration sea-change in 1870,1 claim that the most likely 
counterfactual would be for growth to slow after 1870 and humanity to remain under the Malthusian 
harrow in a a Steampunk World.

But, for the purpose of my book, this is a side issue. We can debate 1712 or 1870 until the cows 
come home. Indeed, economic historians will debate it as long as the human species lasts—and 
perhaps longer. My book wants to look forward from 1870, not backward at the earlier 1800s, the 
1700s, and the times before.

NO, NO, NO! DONa€™ T GET DISTRACTED AND TANGENTIAL!!

Trying againa€!

1870 Was the Hinge of History:

Before 1870, there was no possibility that the economic pie could be big enough. Slow technological 
progress, the necessity under patriarchy of trying to have more sons in the hope that at least one 
would survive, and natural resource scarcity a€’’those put mankind under the Malthusian harrow, in 
dire poverty. Most social energy back then was devoted to the elite's (a) running a 
force-and-fraud, exploitation-and-domination machine, (b) elbowing other potential
elites out of the way, and then (c) utilizing their ill-gotten gains in building a high culture in 
which the non-A©lite were villains and churns.

After 1870, technological progress took off like a rocket. It rapidly became clear that there was a 
good chance that humanity would soon, in historical timescales, gain the technological powers to 
bake a sufficiently large economic pie that everybody could have enough.

Then, having baked a sufficiently large economic pie, all humanity would have to do is solve the 
second order problems of slicing the pie, and then tasting the pie a€“ utilizing our 
soon-to-be-immense collective wealth to enable people to flourish, to live lives that were safe, 
secure, healthy, and happy.
Before 1870, the road to anything one might claim as even a semi-utopia was closed. After 1870, the 
road was open.

We can see this if we make the heroic leaps of (a) trusting our estimates of human productivity 
levels and living standards in the past, and (b) identifying the level of technology a€’’the value 
of the stock of useful ideas about manipulating nature and organizing humans deployed in and 
diffused throughout the world economya€”as proportional to average real income times the square 
root of population.

Then we see that back before 1500 it was a very good century in which technology improved by more 
than 5% in a century^.”and, no, the march upward was not as an increasing pace. Over the 1500-1770 
Imperial-Commercial era the rate of technology growth jumped up to 15%/century: the Columbian 
Exchange, the rest of full globalization, and a historically unique tinkering-inventing culture at 
the western edge of Eurasia playing about equal roles in the
acceleration. Over the 1770-1870 Industrial-Revolution century deployed-and-diffused technology 
grew by 55%, with the benefits of concentrating the entire manufacturing of the globe in the region 
most productive, a unique engineering-inventing culture in the 300-mile radius circle around Dover, 
England, and the very lucky fact that the last glaciers had given us access to mines better than 
gold mines: mines of unbelievably cheap and accessible coal.

But you can only concentrate global manufacturing once. And you can only mine the near-surface coal 
once.

And even at the boosted 1770-1870 pace, growth did not get humanity out from under the Malthusian 
harrow. It was in the 1870s that John Stuart Mill published the last edition of his -Principles of 
Political Economy_, and he was then still claiming:

Hitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the daya€™ s 
toil of any human being. They have enabled a greater population to live the same life of drudgery 
and imprisonment, and an increased number of manufacturers and others to make fortunesa€!

After 1870, however, the economy went into gear: a 2.1%/year technology growth rate; a 33-year 
doubling time. Previously unimaginable economic growth revolutionized human life over and over, 
generation by generation, in not just one episode of Schumpeterian creative destruction but in 
repeated, never-ceasing episodes.

The problem of baking a sufficiently large economic pie so that everyone could, potentially, have 
_**enough**_ became visible. Accomplishing that seemed straightforward: let science rip to 
discovery, let engineering too rip to develop the fruits of science, and then let the market 
economy rip to deploy and diffuse the technologies of human benefit. And the market economy could 
do this, for if market prices are properly aligned are properly aligned with social
values, the market economy is a magnificent crowdsourcing machine for humanity to use to solve the 
problems that it can be set. And the market can be set the problem of applying technology to 
produce wealth.

As of now, we have long since achieved what previous centuries would have seen as a solution to the 
problem of baking a sufficiently large economic pie to serve as the foundation for a proper utopia.
But somehow our utopia is not here.

After 1870 the problem of baking a big-enough pie was on track to being solved. And then? The 
problems of slicing and tasting the pie were seen by our predecessors as second-order problems, or 
barely problems at all. With potentially _**enough**_, there is no reason to maintain the 
force-and-fraud exploitation-and-domination machine that A©lites before 1870 had used to slice the 
pie to their benefit. And the problem of tastinga€’’utilizing our technological
powers to live life wisely and well, to empower human flourishing to produce safety, security, 
health, and happinessa€’’should not be beyond the powers of a humanity that can invent AC power and 
the microprocessor, should it.

What went wrong? What happened.

This, I think, my book has nailed. Letting the market economy rip to solve the problem of making 
enough had consequences. The repeated, sequential, Schumpeterian creative-destruction economic 
revolutions meant that all was solid melted into aira€”all established patterns and orders were 
steamed away. Again and again. Men (and women) did have to try to build new institutions to manage 
the problems and opportunities of production, distribution, and
utilization that the onrushing technological cornucopia brought.

But, as Friedrich Engelsa€”this was Engels more than Marxa€”all of the rest of society must grow 
out of and be compatible with the technological base that is the shape of the forces of production. 
Revolutionizing technology every generation meant that the societal software running on the 
forces-of-production hardware needed to be rewritten on the fly as well. What had worked a 
generation ago, as for as socio-economo-political order was concerned, would
not work now. What was cobbled together to fit the situation now would be buggy and crash in less 
than a generation. That was what post-1870 meant. And that was a new dynamic pattern for human 
history.

But there was more. The market economy had to be unleashed to apply technology to wealth creation. 
But the market economy produces wealth. It does not produce anything that society would regard as 
just.

Friedrich von Hayeka€”the genius who most clearly saw the value of the market economy for 
crowdsourcinga€’’warned us not ask for social justice. Attempting to achieve it would undermine the 
market economya€™ s ability to do what it could do, and put us on, well, The Road to Serfdom. 
a€oeThe market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the marketa€D had to be our 
only gospel.

But, as the genius Karl Polanyi put it, people will not stand for being told "blessed be the name 
of the market" that there are no rights but property rights, and Friedrich von Hayek is their 
prophet. People instead insist that a€oethe market was made for man, not man for the marketa€D. 
People saw themselves as deserving communities, incomes, and stability. They needed their Polanyian 
rightsa€”to economic security, to an income level proportional to what they
deserved, that other people should have income levels proportional to what they deserved too, in a 
connected society that gave them respect and placea€”plus that you should have some power in 
society even if you had no wealth. Trying to bring about the stark utopia of market society would 
thus be overwhelmed by social-political movements seeking social justicea€”and society might think 
that what was just could turn disastrous: :Hitler got substantial buy-
in to his version, involving the extermination Jews and the demographic replacement of the 
population of Eastern Europe by ethnic Germans.

And, off in the corner, we have John Maynard Keynes whimpering: if only governments allowed his 
technocratic students to conduct a sensible monetary policy, along with a "somewhat comprehensive" 
socialization of investment, everyone would have a job in a tight labor market that gave some 
social power to the working class, technology plus compound interest would wreak marvels, 
rock-bottom interest rates would "euthanize" rentiersa€’’they could only
exert social power only at the cost of spending down their capitala€”and so humanity would solve 
the problems of production and distribution, leaving humanity to grapple with its real problem: 
that of utilization of our wealth to create a truly human world.

If we had time, we could go through the generations, the modes-of-production, the political-economy 
orders. But let me just say that it was was within these parametersa€”von Hayekian, Polanyian, 
Keynesiana€”that people frantically tried to rewrite society's socio-economic running code on the 
fly to cope with the technological changes in the underlying forces-of-production hardware.

Perhaps humanity, did indeed come close to an institutional-societal setup to tackle the problems 
of slicing and tasting. Post-WWII "social democracy" in the rich countries was a good try. 
Keynesian focus on full employment (and low interest rates to make amortizing the WWII-era debt 
easy), Beveridgian equality-through-redistribution (and public provision), plus a little Pigovian 
externality-compensation produced the Thirty Glorious Years.
But somehow social democracy failed its sustainability test, and was replaced by neoliberalism, 
which stubbornly persists in spite of its failure to fulfill any of its promises except that it 
would make the rich much richer with much more social power. Society may not know what "social 
justice" is, but it knows that it manifestly does not consist of giving benefits to and making life 
easy for those it assesses as "undeserving".

And so the wheel turned. Here we are. Why are not the good people of the global north happier and 
more satisfied with the techno-utopian marvels that have been delivered to them? Why has great 
wealth in historical perspective produced not reduced but increased economic anxiety? And how does 
that economic anxiety get transformed into ethno-nationalist fear and rage?

How is it that the neoliberal ordering of society still survives? In the global north, at least, it 
has not fulfilled its promise of restoring golden-age growth rates, or dismantling rent-seeking 
interests, or restoring society's moral center, or achieving a pro-producer form of social justice. 
In fact, it accomplished exactly none of the promises made by its original salesmen, save for 
making the rich richer and society more economically unequal. And yet it hung on.
Our current situation: in the rich countries there is enough by any reasonable standard, and yet we 
are all unhappy, all earnestly seeking to discover who the enemies are who have somehow stolen our 
rich birthright and fed us unappetizing lentil stew instead.

What do we do next? The answer to this question my book simply punts. That is for a younger 
generation than my failed one to decide. Global warming. Ethno-national terrorism on all scales 
from the individual AR-15 to the Combined Arms Army. Nuclear proliferation. Revived fascism. 
Technokleptocracy. I do quail.
As John Maynard Keynes wrote back in 1924, any call to follow a particular plan of action:

assumes... a plan exists.... [But] we lack more than usual a coherent scheme of progress, a 
tangible ideal. All the political parties alike have their origins in past ideas and not in new 
ideas.... No one has a gospel. The next move is with the head...

Slouching: Responding to Critics II:

The substantive critics of the book are beginning to show up. Critical comment B:

I thinka€! the market (if we can even think of it as one concrete thing) is not really the core 
driver of our successes and failures. I think it is rather our capacity to cooperate with each 
other, or not, which you capture in multiple places by the issue of trust. We cannot transact in 
any market (virtuous or otherwise) if we dona€™t trust each other, or have sufficient rules and 
enforcement of them to mimic trust where none existed
organicallya€!. [Thus] I find statements such as this one on development in the global south to be 
really misleading: the reason that the global south did not catch up or even keep pace (p. 341) as: 
a€oeThe pre-World War II colonial masters did next to nothing to prepare the colonized nations of 
Asia and Africa for independent prosperity.a€D

The lack of effort on the part of former colonizers may well be true (although material and advice 
aid to the global south has been a very big industry for a long timea€’’simultaneously accused of 
being patronizing and not enough). But that is only one hypothesis among many possible. And it 
overlooks the role of trust-supporting-exchange entirely. I think it is possible to a€~teacha€™ 
people not to trust, but much more difficult to teach
them to trust. So, it is not unreasonable to go next to the African slave trades of 1600-1900 
period as a teacher of not-trust. This too is a testable hypothesis, but I suspect many of the 
standard tests are post-hoca€!

I think I was unclear here, to compressed, and this is a fault in my writing. I was thinking along 
the lines of:

• Imperialists show up and dismantle existing networks of commodity and favor exchangea€”the forms 
of interaction that both build and result from social trust.

• Imperialists assimilate the colonies into their own trust-and-exchange networks.

•  Imperialists are uninterested in building the physical and educational and network 
infrastructure of a "Hamiltonian" industrial policy to give their colonies a fast track to 
something like Japan-style industrialization and modernization.

•  Imperialists withdraw (or, in the case of Latin America, which I see as largely "colonizeda€D 
internally by its own notionally Castilian-descended A©lites, fight tooth and nail to stop the 
course of history), and as they withdraw take their trust networks with them, leaving rubble.

•  Over and above this, sub-Saharan Africa bears a special trust-destruction burden as part of the 
legacy of Atlantic (and other) slave trades. Cue Shaihu Umar and the sad story of the first Prime 
Minister of Nigeria, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, ending in his murder. That is my guess of the source 
of much of 1950-2000 exceptional sub-Sarahan African growth retardation.

I also guess I am an optimist, and a true believer in the doux commerce thesis: give yourself a 
generation of people exchanging commodities for good money, and you start viewing everyone as a 
trustable and likable potential partner in win-win market exchange. Potential win-win Virtua 
circles abound. They do, however, interfere with the favor-based redistributive logic of 
state-building. And so where the withdrawing imperial powers did not leave much of an
intact functioning state but only a ritualistic onea€!
