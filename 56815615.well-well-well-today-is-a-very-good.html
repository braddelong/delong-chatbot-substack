Bradford DeLong: “Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Twentieth Century”</em>: ‘Spectacular economic growth in the long 20th century fueled visionary hopes, but never quite fulfilled them, according to this sweeping study. UC Berkeley economic historian DeLong (coauthor, <em>Concrete Economics</em>) surveys the period from 1870 to 2010, an era when, he argues, advances in global shipping, vertically integrated corporations, and new technologies hatched in industrial research labs created an unprecedented rise in productivity that for the first time raised humanity out of poverty. It was also a period when economic theories and crises drove history, from the pursuit of a communist utopia in the Soviet Union to the Great Depression that propelled Hitler to power in Germany.</p><p>Beneath the century’s upheavals, DeLong sees a perennial tension between economic theorists Friedrich von Hayek, who anathematized state interference in free markets, and Karl Polanyi, who insisted that state intervention is needed to protect society from the disruptions of profit-maximizing market economies. (DeLong blames Hayekian market fundamentalism for dissuading the U.S. government from undertaking enough deficit spending to spur recovery from the Great Recession of 2008.) The author conveys a wealth of information in elegant, accessible prose, combining grand, epochal perspectives with fascinating discursions on everything from alternating-current electricity to the gender wage gap. The result is a cogent interpretation of economic modernity that illuminates both its nigh-miraculous achievements and its seething discontents.

Bradford DeLong</em>: A survey of the monumental transformations—and failed promises—brought about by an extraordinary rise in prosperity.</p><p>DeLong, a Berkeley professor of economics, offers a sweeping account of economic history over the “long twentieth century”—1870 to 2010. Those years, he argues, were “the most consequential years of all humanity’s centuries,” in which “the most important historical thread was what anyone would call the economic one, for it was the century that saw us end our near-universal dire material poverty.”</p><p>The book’s “grand narrative” charts how, in response to increased globalization and the development of modern research facilities and corporate business structures, wealth increased remarkably for a large proportion of the world’s population, prompting radical changes to long-standing social and political configurations. As the author’s mix of close economic analyses and illustrative “vignettes” demonstrates, this upsurge in prosperity incited utopian dreams but repeatedly failed—sometimes spectacularly—to realize them. At the end of the period in question, DeLong concludes, optimism about progress in eliminating extreme poverty and more equitably distributing wealth was at a low ebb, and faith in America as a leader in such efforts is in marked decline.</p><p>This is a lengthy text, and some of the chapters meander unnecessarily, but overall, the author ably anatomizes his subject with admirable clarity, offering accessible and illuminating explanations of key historical shifts and the socio-economic forces driving them. Among the most gripping and persuasive chapters are those that explain the acceleration of globalization in the late 19th century, the causes of the Great Depression (and what might have mitigated it), and the origins and implications of the rise of neoliberalism at the end of the 20th century.</p><p>A sprawling but carefully argued, edifying account of modern economic history and its impact on global well-being.</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/j-bradford-delong/slouching-towards-utopia/">https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/j-bradford-delong/slouching-towards-utopia/</a>&gt;</p><p>====</p><h3><strong>UK EDITION BLURBS:</strong></h3><p>‘An intellectually exciting and entertaining gallop along the arc of twentieth-century economic history. DeLong puts together the puzzle of the past to tell a story of remarkable achievements as well as setbacks. A great way to understand the forces that have shaped the world today’—MINOUCHE SHAFIK, Director, London School of Economics and Political Science</p><p>‘The period 1870-2010 - what DeLong calls the "long twentieth century”- saw the world break decisively free of its Malthusian chains, with levels of per capita economic growth without any parallel in human history. This wonderfully researched and written book explains the roots of this vertiginous ascent towards utopia, while also exposing the causes of the subsequent flat-lining in our economic fortunes and what action is now needed to ensure the long century is viewed by future historians as the historical rule, not the exception’—ANDREW G. HALDANE, Chief Executive of the RSA, and former Chief Economist at the Bank of England</p><p>‘Brad DeLong manages brilliantly to combine detailed analysis of a huge sweep of global history with an accessible and engaging narrative. The result is a book full of well founded and penetrating insights that will appeal to anyone interested in the causes and consequences of modern economic growth’—ROBERT C ALLEN, Distinguished Professor of Economic History at New York University, Abu Dhabi, and a Senior Research Fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link

They came up with three approaches… said that DecoPac had experienced a “material adverse effect” due to the decline in its business during the pandemic…. had not complied with its covenant to “operate the Business in the Ordinary Course of Business”… took steps to blow up their financing…. This is important because the contract allowed DecoPac to seek specific performance… only if “full proceeds of the Debt Financing have been funded to Buyer.”… So Kohlberg canceled the deal and DecoPac sued. The vice chancellor was not amused by Kohlberg’s excuses…. Because there is no debt financing in place, the buyers argue that the court may not grant specific performance. The court disagrees…. This decision deems the debt financing condition met because the buyers contributed materially to lack of debt financing by breaching their reasonable-best-efforts obligation…. This post-trial decision resolves all issues in favor of the seller and orders the buyers to close on the purchase agreement. On specific performance in particular, she wrote… “This court has not hesitated to order specific performance in cases of this nature, particularly where sophisticated parties represented by sophisticated counsel stipulate that specific performance would be an appropriate remedy in the event of breach.”… The deal closed in May 2021, a few weeks after her decision; I guess Kohlberg figured out its financing…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-12/i-was-told-there-d-be-a-cake-merger#xj4y7vzkg">https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-12/i-was-told-there-d-be-a-cake-merger#xj4y7vzkg</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Scientific induction has worked. So far. That does not mean that scientific induction in the corresponding worldview has any rational justification. But it does mean that it is the kind of thing that tends to evolve, and that if you, personally, deviate from it, you may find yourself, well, taking horse tranquilizer NOV an attempt to cure a dangerous respiratory virus, or participating in an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States by force and violence:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Cosma Shalizi</strong>: <em>Review of Collins and Evans, Why Democracies Need Science</em>: ‘What the late great anthropologist-philosopher Ernest Gellner sometimes called believing that “positivism is right, for Hegelian reasons”. Namely: world-views, and the ways of life which go along with them, have to be taken as more or less total packages.(“Fundamental changes transform identities”: <em>Plough, Sword, and Book</em>, p. 194.) Precisely for this reason, attempts to find neutral criteria which could truly rationally compel someone to accept one such package over another have at best foundered on circularity. But some of those packages are a damn sight more attractive than others. The package which Gellner sometimes abbreviated as “positivism”, where concepts are submitted to empirical control, where description and prescription are carefully separated, etc., etc. — in short, the scientific world-view — has proven to be an immensely attractive one, because it works in the world. It has transformed the ecology of humanity, and is (as he put it somewhere) visibly devouring every other form of society. At this level, we may have no option beyond a total choice without rational justification. It does not follow that we should accord deference to every enterprise which purports to be part of the larger scientific world-view, particularly when it is very shaky about things like whether its concepts actually refer to anything in experience…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="http://bactra.org/reviews/collins-evans.html">http://bactra.org/reviews/collins-evans.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Yes.
