Forthcoming September 6,2022, from Basic Books:

Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Long Twentieth Century : Paragraph 10: My 
estimatea€”or perhaps my very crude personal guessa€”of the average worldwide pace of what is at 
the core of humanitya€™ s economic growth, the proportional rate of growth of my index of the value 
of the stock of useful ideas about manipulating
nature and organizing humans that were discovered, developed, and deployed into the world economy, 
shot up from about 0.45 percent per year before 1870 to 2.1 percent per year afterward, truly a 
watershed-boundary crossing difference. A 2.1 percent average growth for the 140 years from 1870 to 
2010 is a multiplication by a factor of 21.5. That was
very good: the growing power to create wealth and earn an income allowed humans to have more of the 
good things, the necessities, conveniences, and luxuries of life, and to better provide for 
themselves and their families. This does not mean that humanity in 2010 was 21.5 times as rich in 
material-welfare terms as it had been in 1870: there were six
times as many people in 2010 as there were in 1870, and the resulting increase in resource scarcity 
would take away from human living standards and labor-productivity levels. As a rough guess, 
average world income per capita in 2010 would be 8.8 times what it was in 1870, meaning an average 
income per capita in 2010 of perhaps $11,000 per year.
(To get the figure of 8.8, you divide 21.5 by the square root of 6.) Hold these figures in your 
head as a very rough guide to the amount by which humanity was richer in 2010 than it was in 
1870a€”and never forget that the riches were vastly more unequally distributed around the globe in 
2010 than they were in 1870.

Getting ready to teach a€oeHistory of Economic GrowthaCD next semester. The current this-week task 
is to get the lecture notes into some kind of shapea€”and decide what kind of course I am going to 
teach, which requires figuring out what kind of students I am going to attract:

Delong Growth Lecture Notes Intro & Theory 2021 12 19

Here are the first tranchesa€’’introduction and theorya€”for the lecture notes for Econ 135 next 
semester. I find myself badly needing guidance on: a. How much growth theory I should teach at the 
start of Econ 135? b. How much of these lecture notes should be simply background reading? c. How 
much of them should I go over in lecture? d. At what
pace I should go over them in lecture? The answers to all these questions depend, of course, on 
what was covered in intermediate macro, and how many of our students actually took intermediate 
macro, and on how much intermediate macro our students actually remember. Plus there is the 
question of how much we are going to want to use growth
theory models to do quantitative calculations and counterfactual experiments later on in the 
course. Which is also something still up for grabs..
