The communist of the later drafts hardly got the chance to breathe the genuine air of revolution. Nevertheless, the original motives for joining were similar, if not identical, in almost every case: experience of social injustice or degradation; a sense of insecurity bred by slumps and social crises; and the craving for a great ideal or purpose, or for a reliable intellectual guide through the shaky labyrinth of modern society…. Socialism, classless society, the withering away of the State—all seemed around the corner…. Communism seemed a new Prometheus—except that he would not be pinned to the rock by Zeus’s wrath…. Our ex-communist now bitterly denounces the betrayal of his hopes. This appears to him to have had almost no precedent. Yet as he eloquently describes his early expectations and illusions, we detect a strangely familiar tone.

Bown &amp; Thomas J. Bollyky</strong>:&nbsp;<em>How COVID–19 Vaccine Supply Chains Emerged in the Midst of a Pandemic</em>: ‘The fact that major economies heavily subsidized many more vaccine candidates than were ultimately deployed was unequivocally correct…. Unpredictable real-world problems could (and did) emerge to affect any given candidate. Some subsidized candidates (e.g., Merck and IAVI) failed entirely. Others (e.g., Novavax, CureVac, Valneva, and Sanofi/GSK) may yet succeed clinically, but they will have taken much longer than Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson &amp; Johnson…. Some of the at-risk public investments to scale up manufacturing for candidates that regulators green-lighted (e.g., Emergent in the United States to produce AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson) proved problematic. Some facilities ran into quality control issues; others were slow to expand because of learning challenges or inadequate access to inputs…. Pfizer and Moderna may turn out to be the success stories ex post. But if those previously untried technologies had not worked, vaccines from Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, and even Novavax or CureVac might have played an even more important role…. They were equivalent to an insurance policy…. Vaccine manufacturers complained about a series of input shortages. Lipids, bioreactor bags, filtration pumps, filters, and other equipment and raw materials were in short supply, potentially slowing the scaling up…. Was there enough public investment in expanding the capacity of the companies manufacturing those key inputs?… Another policy problem may have been too little global public investment in expanding the production capacity of those input suppliers. Although the United States, and to a lesser extent CEPI, subsidized upstream equipment and raw material providers in addition to downstream vaccine manufacturers, their efforts were likely insufficient…. The policy “failures” in these cases would be the lack of international policy coordination…. New vaccine manufacturing supply chains emerged to produce the billions of doses delivered by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca/Oxford, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Heavy government involvement—especially considerable public investment made at risk—shaped the evolution of these supply chains and the speed at which they were formed. But more information is needed—on the inputs that went in and the outputs that came out—from the dozens of production facilities in the supply chains behind those brand names…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/documents/wp21-12.pdf">https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/documents/wp21-12.pdf</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Michael Pettis</strong>:<em>&nbsp;‘Rogoff posits a China that has little to do with China</em>…. He notes that a minimum requirement for the global use of the RMB is that “you have to have some kind of very clear rules of law, which [Chinese leaders] don’t have right now.” He’s right…. To be more specific, to get the rest of Asia or the world to hold its excess savings in RMB, China would have to enshrine the rights of private property (especially foreign-owned private property) and would have to accept the rule of law above the rule of the party. That is why most excess savings are held in countries like the US and the UK, but as Beijing has made clear, placing private property rights beyond government interference and forcing the party to submit to the rule of law are not even aspirations… against China’s best interests…. Whether one agrees or disagrees, the fact is that China and the Chinese government have no plans to move in that direction…. If foreigners ever do decide to hold… savings in China, by definition… China must run persistent capital account surpluses… transform… from an economy with structural demand deficiencies and the highest savings rate in history into one with structural savings deficiencies…. Rogoff is really arguing… that the minimum requirement for the RMB to play a major international role is that the Chinese economy and the Chinese political system become something completely different….
