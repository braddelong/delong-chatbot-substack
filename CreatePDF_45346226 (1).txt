First:

My take on the worlda€”at least the global northa€’’since 2010 or so is a downer one:

Is there anybody in any previous century who would not be amazed and incredulous at seeing 
humanitya€™ s technological and organizational powers as of 2010? Yet they would then go on to the 
next question: Why, with such godlike powers to command nature and organize ourselves, have we done 
so little to build a truly human world, to approach within sight of any of our utopias?

As of 2010, distrust in Americaa€™ s hegemonic role had been cemented by Middle Eastern 
misadventures, and confidence that America was in some ways a plausible model was being replaced by 
a fear that in most ways it was a horrible warning. Discontent had grown with exploding income and 
wealth inequality that few even of its advocates associated with any boost to economic growth.
The Great Recession of 2008-10 had revealed the emptiness of claims that the neoliberal technocrats 
had finally gotten the problems of economic management right. The political institutions of the 
global north continued to fail to even begin to grapple with the problem of global warming. 
Standard measurements told us that the underlying engine of productivity growth had begun to stall.

And in 2010 the great and good of the global north were about to fail to prioritize a rapid 
restoration of full employment. They would fail to understand and manage the discontents that would 
bring neofascist and fascist-adjacent politicians to prominence worldwide in the 2010s. Thus the 
long twentieth centurya€™ s story was over.
Perhaps it did not have to end then, in 2010. Perhaps the bright future that many had 
envisioneda€”the idea that rapid equitable growth could be restored as the information-technology 
boom roared aheada€”was always illusory. Or perhaps the opportunity could have been grasped, had 
chance and contingency turned out otherwise.

Perhaps if in 2008 the United States had elected an FDR, he (or she) could have worked a 
miraclea€”as the original FDR had, unexpectedly, done in 1933 and after. Perhaps even in 2016 the 
dry bones of the long twentieth-century pattern of rapid productivity growth, governments that 
could manage the creative-destruction transformations such growth brought to the world, and American
exceptionalism could have been made to live again. But it turned out that post-2010 America would 
instead elect Donald Trump, and western Europe would do little better, ending possibilities of 
revivification.

That my take is this gloomy makes it much more urgent that I engage with and absorb Azeem Azhar: 
The Exponential Age: How Accelerating Technology is Transforming Business, Politics & Society 
<https://www.amazon.com/Exponential-Age-Accelerating-Technologv-Transforming/dp/1635769094>. For 
his take is close to the very opposite of mine:

IN 2020, AMAZON turned 26 years old. Over the previous quarter of a century, the company had 
transformed shoppinga€!. At the heart of its success is a staggering $36 billion research and 
development budget in 2019, used to develop everything from robots to smart home assistants. This 
suma€! is not far off the UK government's annual budget for research and
development^!. Ten years earlier, Amazona€™ s research budget had been $1.2 billion. Over the 
course of the next decade, the firm increased its annual R&D budget by about 44 per cent every 
yeara€!. In the process, Amazon created a chasm between the old world and the new. The approach of 
traditional business was to rely on models that had succeeded yesterday.
They   were based on a strategy that tomorrow might be a little different now, but not markedly so. 
This kind of linear thinking, rooted in the assumption that change would take decades, not months, 
may have worked in the pasta€”but not anymore. Amazon understood the nature of the Exponential 
Agea€!. Those that couldn't keep up would be undone at remarkable
speed. This divergence between the old and the new is one example of what I call the exponential 
gapa€!.

In the Exponential Age, one primary input for a company is its ability to process information. One 
of the main costs to process that data is computation. And the cost of computation didna€™ t rise 
each year, it declined rapidlya€!. If an organisation needs to do something that uses computation, 
and that task is too expensive today, it probably wona€™ t be too expensive
in a couple of yearsa€!. Organisations that understood this deflation, and planned for it, became 
well-positioned to take advantage of the Exponential Agea€!. Companies that didn't adapt to 
exponential technology shifts, like much of the newspaper publishing industry, didn't stand a 
chancea€!. Consider for a moment what it actually feels like to live in the Exponential
Agea€”the answer, as many readers will know, is bewildering. Someone like me, born in the early 
1970s, has experienced wave after wave of innovations. From the landline to the mobile, dialup 
internet to mobile internet, vinyl records to CDs to MP3s to streaming. Ia€™ ve owned the Bee 
Geesa€™ Saturday Night Fever on at least five different formatsa€!

The problem is not just that we underestimate exponential growth. Experts who are mindful of the 
power of exponentiality can also be prone to overestimate its powera€!. A slight error in your 
basic assumptions can throw your whole prediction offa€!. And these problems of underestimation and 
overestimation are confounded by a third difficultya€! a€oemis-
estimationa€da€!. The primary cause of the exponential gap is our failure to predict the cadence of 
exponential change, the secondary cause is our consequent failure to adapt to it. As the speed of 
change increases, our society remoulds itself at a much slower pacea€!.

This is an urgent need. In the Exponential Age the institutions that govern our economies will 
cease to be fit for purpose. New technologies will clash with our existing expectations, rules and 
systems. We need radical thinking to prevent the exponential gap eroding the fabric of our 
societya€!
[a€!]

Acknowledging that the direction of technology is not preordained doesna€™ t amount to saying that 
technology isna€™ t transformative. Elsewhere, Kranzberg writes that technology a€oeis neither 
good, nor bad, nor is it neutral.a€D Like it or not, technology brings change. And so the second 
stage in our shift in mindset involves acceptancea€!. Chaotic, unpredictable
developments can be for the gooda€”ita€™ s our responsibility to direct them where we can and 
manage their surprises when we cana€™ t. As the Exponential Age accelerates, general purpose 
technologies will affect all of our most cherished institutionsa€!. Technology is unpredictable. It 
is hard to say how new innovations will transform our society, as they constantly
interact  with our approaches to business, work, place, conflict and politics.

Certainly from here in Berkeley on the outskirts of Silicon Valley it feels as if Azeem Azhar is 
righta€”that humanitya€™ s technical competence to manipulate nature and organize and communicate 
with ourselves is increasing faster than it ever has before, faster than the 35 years or so it took 
for each of the four doublings of human technological competence from 1870 to 2010, and then we
have to look back from 1870 to 1600 for the previous doubling (and then back from 1600 to 200 for 
the doubling before that). But the real-wage numbers we have suggest that for the working and 
middle class real wages and salaries have for 15 years been increasing at an average rate of only 
0.5%/year, compared to 2.0%/year or so in the neoliberal age from 1975-2005, and 3.0%/year or more
in the 1945-1975 Thirty Glorious Years of the preceding social-democratic age. Yes, working- and 
middle-class people today have access to awesome electronic gadgets and mind-blowing frontier 
medical therapies, but these have been counterbalanced by the standard indicia of middle-class 
making-ita€”a house in a good neighborhood with an easy commute, assurance that if your children
study hard and turn out to be smart they can graduate from a good college without a huge debt load, 
and the ability to look the overclass in the face without feeling that they are beings of a 
different ordera€’’harder to grasp.

A bet that the wage-growth slowdown and the status-anxiety creation that our standard statistics 
and measurements tell us is in fact masking a much more hopeful, exponential-growth reality is 
certainly one that can be made. Whether it is true or not depends on how fast our leading-sector 
technologies grow exponentially, and how many doublings they have before demand for their services
becomes inelastic and they cease to be important, or they simply run into the upper end of their 
S-curve logistic and converge to their respective anecdotes. So far, however, I am not convinced. 
At times I see Silicon Valley as engaged in brain-hacking to glue peoplea€™ s eyeballs to screens 
so that they can be sold ads, and if that is what we use our technologies for it would better if 
they did not
develop so fast.

Forthcoming September 6,2022, from Basic Books:

Slouching Towards Utopia: A History of the Long Twentieth Century. Paragraph 6: As the genius Dr. 
Jekyll-like Austro-English-Chicagoan moral philosopher Friedrich August von Hayek observed, the 
market economy crowdsourcesa€ ’’incentivizes and coordinates at the grassrootsa€”solutions to the 
problems it sets. Back before 1870 humanity did not have the technologies or the
organizations to allow a market economy to pose the problem of how to make the economy rich. So 
even though humanity had had market economies, or at least market sectors within its economies, for 
thousands of years before 1870, all that markets could do was to find customers for producers of 
luxuries and conveniences, and make the lives of the rich luxurious and of the middle class
convenient and comfortable.

The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) in November was 6.8% higher than in November 2020. Thata€™ s 
the fastest yearly rate of inflation since the early 1980sa€”and much faster than the prevailing 
rate of inflation as recently as this spring. It sounds bad, but it shouldna€™ ta€”yeta€”be a cause

David States: a€™ Wea€™ re thinking all wrong about the variants. The prevailing narrative is that 
each new variant comes to dominate because ita€™ s more transmissible than previous variants. A 
better view may be that ita€™ s immune escape driving viral diversity. If it was just 
transmissibility, older viruses would continue to spread, even if somewhat more slowly, but thata€™ 
s not
whata€™ s happening. Older variants are declining in absolute case count suggesting that there is 
competition between variants. How can variants compete with each other? Immune escape. A variant 
that evades the immunity induced by a different variant can continue to spread while spread of the 
old variant is limited to only hosts who have not been infected or vaccinateda€!. Other viruses
also evolve to escape prevailing immunity. E.g. we have studied immune escape in influenza viruses 
extensively Can immune escape be important if we are still far from a€oeherd immunitya€n?a€! RO is 
an artificial construct, and ita€™ s as much a property of the population as it is of the virusa€!. 
It doesna€™ t make much sense to talk about RO as a property of the virus alonea€!
