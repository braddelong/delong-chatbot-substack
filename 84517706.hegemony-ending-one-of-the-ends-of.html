At the end of the 1980s, after the end of the Cold War, George H.W. Bush reassured the world that US military supremacy was benign because the US military would be deployed only in support of an overwhelming majority vote of a country’s people, or according to the will of the UN Security Council. The Clinton administration had changed this to “according to the will of the NATO alliance”; and then the George W. Bush administration had changed it to “more or less at random, according to false and misleadingly interpreted intelligence, against countries that do not possess nuclear weapons.” Countries took note…</p><div><hr></div><p>“Trusted leader” is perhaps laying it on too thick. </p><p>But it is the case that from 1870 to 2010 first the United Kingdom and then the United States believed that it was a benevolent hegemon, guiding the world militarily, diplomatically, and economically toward an ever-brighter future of prosperity, peace, and civilization. On the military side, preventing the growth of an authoritarian or radical power that could upset the liberal order; on the diplomatic side, a concert of liberal powers or of united nations; and on the economic side globalization and trade. This meant that often the hegemonic power had to, or perceived itself as having to, submerge its own short-run national interests in order to keep the global international system on course.</p><p>All this fell apart in 2003, and more sale in 2017, as the United States shifted to acting much more like simply another normal great power—and an erratic and ill-governed one at that.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/hegemony-ending-one-of-the-ends-of?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/hegemony-ending-one-of-the-ends-of?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>MUST-READ: <strong>Karl Marx in Perspective:</strong></h2><blockquote><p><strong>Branko Milanovic: </strong><a href="https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/the-unexpected-immortality-of-karl">The unexpected immortality of Karl Marx</a>: Socrates and Jesus... would not have become worldwide... had it not been for people who propagated their thought... Plato, and... Paul.... [For]] Marx, that role was played by Friedrich Engels.... Had not Engels spent more than a decade &nbsp;putting Marx’s papers in order and producing, out of dispersed notes, two additional volumes of <em>Das Capital</em>, Marx’s fame would have ended at the point where it was in 1883. It would have been rather minimal.... </p><p>Had there not been the Great War... Marx’s influence would have steadily gone down as the social-democrats in Germany moved toward reformism and “revisionism”. His picture would have probably been displayed among the historical “maîtres à penser” of the German social-democracy but not much of his influence would have remained.... But then the October Revolution and Lenin came (the second event), totally transforming the scene.... </p><p>Then as the Comintern began to abandon its Eurocentrism and to get engaged into anti-imperialist struggles in the Third World, Marx’s influence expanded to the areas no one could have predicted it would (the third event). This decisive turn away from Eurocentrism and towards the Third World,&nbsp; including, of momentous importance, to China, transformed Marx from a German and European thinker into a global figure....&nbsp; Who could have imagined that two bearded 19th century German exiles would on special occasions adorn the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Beijing?</p><p><strong>Responsibility.</strong> But with the success goes responsibility. As communism’s crimes became better known, and gradually increasingly laid at Marx’s door, and as communist regimes sputtered and their mournful and poorly educated ideologues regurgitated predictable phrases, Marx’s thought suffered an eclipse. And the question was asked: were Marx’s ideas, his “spirit”, responsible for many of the atrocities committed by the regimes that ruled in his name—perhaps his “ghosts”?... The ideas that were implemented in the 1920s Soviet Union, and after the Second World War in most of Eastern Europe and China were very much the ideas that Marx expressed in his writings even if his discussion of the post-capitalist society was scarce.... </p><p>The influence did not end: the Chinese government’s decision in the early 1980s concerning how far to allow the growth of the private sector was justified by Marx’s true or apocryphal statement that workers’ exploitation was acceptable if the total number of employees hired by a capitalist does not exceed seven.... Even the violence which often accompanied communist revolutions or policies cannot be simply ascribed to historical contingencies or the non-democratic past of the countries that implemented Marxist ideology.... His was not exactly the language of reformism, conciliation, and “the long march through the institutions”....</p><p>Did we thus establish his responsibility and should we stop there? Not really. Because it is wrong to draw a direct line, or to entirely reject, an ideology because of its real-world consequences.... The ideas of the French Revolution of liberty, equality, and fraternity are not to be dismissed because that revolution quickly degenerated into reign of terror.... Marx’s ideas have indeed to be held responsible as much as the ideas of other economists and political scientists but that responsibility cannot obliterate the importance of his core ideas of human progress, equity, and revolution.</p><p><strong>The rebel, the critic, and the analyst.</strong>&nbsp;There are two features of Marx’s that will, guarantee his influence.... The first is rebellion or revolution in its most primordial meaning of dramatic and thoroughgoing change.... Marx will always appeal to people who want to change the existing order of things.... So long as capitalism exists, Marx will be read as its most astute analyst. He identified two crucial and historically original features of capitalism: insatiable need for gain (“Accumulate, accumulate, this is Moses and all the prophets”), and the need for perpetual expansion to new territories or areas of production.... If capitalism ceases&nbsp; to exist, however, Marx will be read as its most prescient critic. So whether we believe that in another 200 years, capitalism will be with us or not, we can be sure that Marx will...</p></blockquote><p>Very nicely done—although I still prefer my own:</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:68330463,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/understanding-karl-marx&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:47874,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Understanding Karl Marx&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;I greatly enjoy and am, in fact, driven to write Grasping Reality—but its long-term viability and quality do depend on voluntary subscriptions from paying supporters.
