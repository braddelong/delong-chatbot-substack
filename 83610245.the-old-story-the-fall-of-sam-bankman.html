FTX periodically uses&nbsp;a portion of its profits to buy back FTT tokens. This makes FTT&nbsp;<em>kind of&nbsp;</em>like&nbsp;<em>stock&nbsp;</em>in FTX: The higher FTX’s profits are, the higher the price of FTT will be.&nbsp;It is not&nbsp;<em>actually&nbsp;</em>stock in FTX…&nbsp;but it is a lot&nbsp;<em>like&nbsp;</em>stock… a bet on FTX’s future profits. But it is also a crypto token, which means that a customer can come to you and post $100&nbsp;worth of FTT as collateral and borrow&nbsp;$50 worth of Bitcoin, or dollars, or whatever, against that collateral, just as they would with any other token…. If you think of the token as “more or less stock,” and you think of a crypto exchange as a securities broker-dealer,&nbsp;<em>this is completely insane.&nbsp;</em>If you go to an investment bank and say “lend me $1 billion, and I will post $2 billion of your stock as collateral,” you are messing with very dark magic&nbsp;and they will say no.&nbsp;The problem with this is that it is&nbsp;<em>wrong-way risk.&nbsp;</em>(It is also, at least sometimes,&nbsp;<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29648502.25221/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMDczZWZhZTItMGUyYy0xMWU3LWIwMzAtNzY4OTU0Mzk0NjIz/56408d458cc2b2a34750fc1dB8aa974e3">illegal</a>.)&nbsp;If people start to worry about the investment bank’s financial health, its stock will go down, which means that its collateral will be less valuable, which means that its financial health will get worse, which means that its stock will go down, etc. It is a&nbsp;death spiral. In general it should not be possible to bankrupt an investment bank by shorting its stock. If one of the bank’s main assets is… a&nbsp;<em>leveraged bet on its own stock&nbsp;</em>— then it is&nbsp;<em>easy&nbsp;</em>to bankrupt it by shorting its stock.</p><p>The worst case is something like: 1. You have 100 Customer As… each… [with] 1 Bitcoin in their accounts and ow[ing] you $10,000. 2 You have 100 Customer Bs who… each have $20,000 in their account and owe you 0.5 Bitcoin. 3. You have loaned 50 of the Customer As’ Bitcoins to the Customer Bs, and $1 million of the Customer Bs’ dollars to the Customer As. You keep the other&nbsp;50 Bitcoins and $1 million as collateral. 4…. You owe clients 100 Bitcoins and $2 million, and that they owe you back 50 Bitcoins and $1 million, and you have 50 Bitcoins and $1 million on hand, so everything balances.</p><p>5. You have one Customer C who says “hi I would like to borrow 50 Bitcoins and $1 million, I will secure that loan with 150,000 FTT, each of which is worth $20.” 6. You say “sure, sounds good”…. 7. Now you have 150,000 of FTT, worth $3 million, as collateral (and no Bitcoins or dollars). 8. Your accounts show that you owe clients 100 Bitcoins and $2 million and 150,000 FTT, and&nbsp;they owe you back 100 Bitcoins and $2 million, and you have 150,000 FTT of collateral [on hand], so everything balances. But then if the value of FTT drops to zero, you have&nbsp;<em>nothing</em>….</p><p>You just have to call up Customer C and say “hey we need all those dollars and Bitcoins back.” But Customer C will not want to give you back all those valuable dollars and Bitcoins in exchange for now-worthless FTT. Also… Customer C… is an FTT whale, and FTT is now worthless. Has it been borrowing elsewhere against FTT? Are all those debts coming due?…</p><p>The reason for a run on FTX is that you think that Alameda is, in my terminology, Customer C. The reason for a run on FTX is if you think that FTX loaned Alameda a bunch of customer assets and got back FTT in exchange. If&nbsp;<em>that’s&nbsp;</em>the case, then a crash in the price of FTT will destabilize FTX.&nbsp;If you’re worried about that, you should take your money out of FTX before the crash. If everyone is worried about that, they will all take their money out of FTX. But FTX doesn’t have their money; it has FTT, and a loan to Alameda…. If, say, the operator of the biggest crypto exchange gently raises one eyebrow and says “FTT, eh?” that can be enough to topple FTX. FTT goes down, leaving FTX undercapitalized, leading to customer withdrawals, leading to ruin….</p><p>It is still early and confusing but that seems to be the story of FTX. Coindesk reported on Alameda’s FTT exposure…. Changpeng “CZ” Zhao…raised eyebrows by&nbsp;<a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29648502.25221/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9jel9iaW5hbmNlL3N0YXR1cy8xNTg5MjgzNDIxNzA0MjkwMzA2/56408d458cc2b2a34750fc1dBe8ae2677">tweeting</a>&nbsp;that Binance would sell its FTT….

If this is the story, then it is not a&nbsp;<em>liquidity&nbsp;</em>crisis but a&nbsp;<em>solvency&nbsp;</em>one….

The details of what went wrong in the beanbag-strewn offices of ftx and Alameda are not yet clear. An exchange, which sits between buyer and seller and takes a spread, should not be an easy business to bankrupt. It is not typically exposed to runs, since it merely holds assets on behalf of investors…. The crypto winter had previously claimed only the types of victims that would be expected, including a poorly designed stablecoin, a hedge fund and several platforms that made risky loans. That it has come for ftx, a well-regarded business, and Mr Bankman-Fried is an enormous blow. It has left other institutions scrambling to reassure customers. Coinbase, a large exchange, has sent out reassuring missives to the press. Its share price has nevertheless shed a fifth of its value in recent days, and is close to all-time lows…</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Charles Dickens</strong>: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/963/pg963-images.html">Little Dorrit</a>: ‘Mr Merdle was immensely rich; a man of prodigious enterprise; a Midas without the ears, who turned all he touched to gold. He was in everything good, from banking to building. He was in Parliament, of course. He was in the City, necessarily. He was Chairman of this, Trustee of that, President of the other. The weightiest of men had said to projectors, “Now, what name have you got? Have you got Merdle?” And, the reply being in the negative, had said, “Then I won’t look at you.”… But, at about the time of High ‘Change, Pressure began to wane, and appalling whispers to circulate, east, west, north, and south. At first they were faint, and went no further than a doubt whether Mr Merdle’s wealth would be found to be as vast as had been supposed; whether there might not be a temporary difficulty in ‘realising’ it; whether there might not even be a temporary suspension (say a month or so), on the part of the wonderful Bank. As the whispers became louder, which they did from that time every minute, they became more threatening…</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Duncan Weldon: </strong><a href="https://duncanweldon.substack.com/p/learning-the-wrong-lessons?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Learning the wrong lessons</a>: ‘The BOE was already raising interest rates to bring inflation back to target. Given that looser fiscal policy would add to demand and hence spending the Bank would have to raise interest rates at a faster pace and to a higher terminal value to offset the government’s actions. Looser fiscal policy meant tighter monetary policy and therefore, gilts fell in value. But that was not all that was going on. There was also <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/038b30c3-f550-4cc0-93ed-9154021d6ee2">the LDI debacle</a>. Which, in the words of the BOE, risked a ‘fire sale dynamic’ in the gilt market…. Fiscal rules are a useful thing. But they need to take account of the economic cycle and focus on the medium term. Rules that require adding to a downturn are bad rules. Promising to do incredible things is not the route to credibility. The biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years – funded by borrowing – was an irrational fiscal policy…. A sharp tightening of fiscal policy now even as consumer demand dries up is equally inappropriate…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donate Subscriptions&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true"><span>Donate Subscriptions</span></a></p><div class="install-substack-app-embed"><img class="install-substack-app-embed-img" src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png"><div class="install-substack-app-embed-text"><div class="install-substack-app-header">Read Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality in the Substack app</div><div class="install-substack-app-text">Available for iOS and Android</div></div><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_context=author-post-insert" target="_blank" class="install-substack-app-embed-link"><button class="install-substack-app-embed-btn button primary">Get the app</button></a></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/the-old-story-the-fall-of-sam-bankman/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/the-old-story-the-fall-of-sam-bankman/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>
