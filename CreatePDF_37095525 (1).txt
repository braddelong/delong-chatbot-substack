Janet Yellen is doing a very good job:

Jeff Cox: Yellen Says the Government Is Operating Like Ita€™ s 2010, Calls for More Aggressive 
Spending: a€~Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called on congressional leaders to get more aggressive

On the history of the weblog Lawyers, Guns, & Money'.

Robert Farley: Behind the Blogging: d~Scott, DJW and myself founded LGM on May 31,2004d!. The site 
rapidly found a small but non-trivial audience, and became a small part of the bigger
blogospheric conversationd!. That small audience grew over time, making it psychologically possible 
to continue contributing to the site even at a time when there were no noticeable financial or
professional reasons to do sod!. Over the years Simon, Dave, the other Dave, Shakes, Vacuum, 
Melissa, Dan, Charli, Chris, Christa, Elizabeth, Abigail, Steve, Bean, Katie, and the dearly missed
SEK  have also helped made this site what it is todayd!. Ads and donations are both part of what 
makes this site function, and all of us here deeply appreciate any contribution you can maked!.

Speaking for myself, apart from my kids and my teaching I feel like LGM is the most important 
contribution that I have been able to make. It has always been an honord!

The world before the Great Dark Age:

Nicholas G. Blackwell: Ahhiyawa, Hatti, & Diplomacy: Implications of Hittite Misperceptions of the 
Mycenaean World: d~The Hittite Tawagalawa Letterd!. HattuAjili III (ca. 1267d“1237
b.c.)d! complained to the king of Ahhiyawa about a Hittite renegade named Piyamaradud! alludes to 
an existing nonaggression pact between Hatti and Ahhiyawa modeled after the well-known
Hittite-Egyptian contractd!. The Tawagalawa Letter thus suggests a gross miscalculation by 
a/attuAjili of Ahhiyawan power. Based on their dealings with Near Eastern empires and particularly
Egypt,   the midd“ 13th-century Hittites developed an image of the Mycenaean state as more 
formidable than the reality.213 The Ahhiyawan king failed to resolve the Piyamaradu situation not
because he had formed an alliance with the Hittite renegade, but because much of the eastern Aegean 
was simply not under his controld!

Certainly Friedman and Friedmanesque policies had next to no constituency either within 
professional Republican politicians or those calling themselves economists after 2005. Hayekians 
and Schumpeterians alld”so much
so that Bernanke was ushered out of the party for trying to apply the Milton Friedman playbook. 
Krugman has an explanation, and it makes logical sense. But given that Friedman had managed to walk 
the tightrope, why
couldnd™t his successors do so:

Paul Krugman (2013): Milton Friedman, Unperson: d'What I think is really interesting is the way 
Friedman has virtually vanished from policy discoursed! This is hardly what you would have
expected not that long ago, when Friedmand™ s reputation bestrode the economic world like a 
colossusd!. Greg Mankiw declared Friedman, not Keynes, the greatest economist of the 20th
centuryd!. Ben Bernanke concluded a speechd!. d'Regarding the Great Depression. Youd™re right, we 
did it. Wed™ re very sorry. But thanks to you, we wond™t do it againdid™ So

what happened?d! Friedmand! wasd! trying to straddle two competing world viewsd! an avid 
free-market advocated! [who] was also a macroeconomic realist, who recognized that the market
definitely did not solve the problem of recessions and depressions. So he tried to wall off 
macroeconomics from everything else, and make it as inoffensive to laissez-faire sensibilities as 
possibled!.
[But]  if markets can go so wrong that they cause Great Depressions, how can you be a free-market 
true believer on everything except macro?d! American conservatismd! had no room for any kind
of interventionism, not even the sterilized, clean-room interventionism of Friedmand™ s monetarism. 
So Friedman has vanished from the policy scened!

Having something valuable may not make you rich: it may just make others brutalize you:

Mark Dincecco, James Fenske, & Anil Menon: The Columbian Exchange & Conflict in Asia: d~Greater 
agricultural potential due to New World crops increased violent conflict after 1500. Rising
caloric potential in a typical grid cell increased conflict by roughly its mean. The result holds 
across several New World crops and conflict types. It is largely driven by South Asiad! a rapacity
effeetd“increases in the gains from appropriation to Asian and non-Asian belligerentsd“as a 
mechanism. Population density, urbanization, and British imperialism significantly mediate the 
impact
of     the Columbian Exchanged!

At its fundamental level, war is and has always been about (a) one group of people stealing stuff, 
(b) individuals acquiring status by demonstrating your personal bravery and competence, and (c) one 
group making some
police somewhere behave as they wish, rather than as others wishd’’encouraging the use of German 
and discouraging the use of French, arresting people who send their taxes to Paris rather than 
Berlin, and changing the
signs to read doeStrassburgdD rather than dceStrasbourgdC. And in the process wreaking a huge 
amount of devastation.

Noah Smith: The Future of war Is Bizarre & Terrifying: d~On December 11,1941d! the Prince of Wales 
and the Repulse, a British battleship and battlecruiserd! had both been sunk by Japanese
aircraftd!. Astute observers had been able to see the signs of the increasing importance of naval 
aviation in the years priord!. But somehow, when the moment came, Churchill was still shockedd!.
Military technology is a hugely important area of innovation, and yet it generally results in 
things getting blown up and society going to hell for a whiled!. Wed™ ve been racing to invent new
military technologiesd! like[ly to]d! alterd! the international balance of power in ways that make 
us more likely to try out the new weapons and see where things standd!. The autonomous,
weaponized drone may replace the human infantryman as the dominant battlefield technology. And as 
always, that shift in military technology will cause huge social upheavald!.. In the Second
Nagorno-Karabakh War, Azerbaijan used dronesd’’purchased cheaply and easily from Turkey and 
Israeld”to crushd! Armenian troopsd! [whose] tanks, missile launchers, artillery, and transport
vehicles    were sitting ducks for their foesd™ cheap disposable dronesd!. This should be as big a 
wakeup call as the Battle of Taranto or the firebombing of Guernicad!. The drones that won the
war                                                                                         for 
Azerbaijan are traditional fossil fuel powered aircraft. Advances in Li-ion batteries have given 
rise to small, cheap, difficult-to-see, difficult-to-shoot quadcopters. Already, militaries are
finding creative uses for thesed!

When a university department becomes an ideological cult:

Jagdish Bhagwati: d™ [Chicago was] very Friedmanesque d! The seminars seemed to oscillate between 
proving that elasticities were large with markets therefore stable, and formulating
competitive hypotheses for apparently imperfectly-competitive industries and coming up with high 
enough R2s. Econometrics was the handmaiden of ideology: things looked imperfect to the naked
eye, especially to that of Chamberlin and Joan Robinson, but they were dYeallyd™ not so and the 
world was d~as ifd™ competitived!. Market imperfections were d~demonstratedd™ to be
negligible and the imperfections rather of government intervention were the subject of active 
researchd!

The historical memory of pre-Re volution Haitid”and the strong desire to avoid institutions 
anything like those before the Revolutiond’’hobbling Haitian economic growth in the twentieth 
century:

Craig Palsson: Small Farms, Large Transaction Costs: HaitiaC™ s Missing Sugar: d~In the eighteenth 
century, Haiti was the worldd™ s leading sugar producer, but when cane surged in the
Caribbean in the early twentieth century, Haiti produced none. Instead, the land sat idle while 
workers emigrated to work on sugar plantations. I examine the hypothesis that historical property 
rights
institutions created high transaction costs for converting land to cane production. I collect new 
data on land-use from 1928d“1950 and a proxy for transaction costs. The evidence suggests
transaction   costs impeded the land market from responding to the sugar boomd!
