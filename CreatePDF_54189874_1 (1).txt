FIRST: Matt Levine on Wonders of the Invisible Crypto World:

The South Sea Company at least had a business plan:

Matt Levine: Another Algorithmic Stablecoin Isna€™ t: a€~Terraa€!an algorithmic stablecoina€!. One 
UST can always be exchanged for a floating quantity of Luna with a market value of $la€!. On first 
principles this is insanea€!. If Luna trades at $0.01, you can print 10 million of them and buy 
100,000 Terra and push the price up. But if Luna trades at $0.00a€! it cannot be used to support 
the price of Terra. And because you just made it up,
there is no particular reason for [Luna] to be worth anything, so there is no particular reason for 
[Terra] to be worth a dollara€!.

Nonetheless! It works?a€! Terraform Labsa€! pays 19.5% promotional interest on UST deposits. People 
want a stablecoin that is worth a dollar, so they are inclined to treat Terra as though ita€™ s 
worth a dollar, which makes it worth a dollar. They buy lots of Luna to turn into Terra, which 
means that the price of Luna goes up, which means that there is plenty of valuable Luna to support 
the price of Terra, which means that Terra is robustly
worth a dollar. Ha, well, oopsa€!. A bank run is a fairly mild event compared to a death spirala€!.

Meanwhile, the mechanism that LFG is using to defend the peg is interesting. It has loaned Bitcoin 
to market makers to use to protect the UST peg to the dollara€!. This means thata€! market 
makersa€! [are] selling Bitcoin to buy USTa€!

$LUNA I'm very sad. I trust cryptos and its
decentralized system and logic. I hate normal

today a lot of people have lost a lot of money

LUNA Price Live Data

Bullish

The live Terra price today is $30.08 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $13,082,145,856 USD. We 
update our LUNA to
USD price in real-time. Terra is down 40.31% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap 
ranking is #14, with a live
market cap of $11,146,979,050 USD. It has a circulating supply of 370,542,314 LUNA coins and the 
max. supply is not
available.

The ultimate crypto line is: gold does not carry a coupon, and central bank-issued cash does not 
carry a coupon, so why shouldn't we be able to issue things that do not carry a coupon and still 
hold value? The standard response is that central bank-issued cash carries value not by the "fiat" 
of the central bank, but because they serve as anticipatory tax receipts. You can show them to the 
tax authority, which takes them, and lo and behold! Your assets are not confiscated by
the Treasury!

And gold? Gold is a special case: time-honored. Devotees of BTC say that they are the first mover 
into this space, and so they are time-honored too. They also say that there are lots of places and 
times in the world where you want your wealth to be at least somewhat hidden, anda€”even though 
most peoplea€™ s BTC is very visible to the authorities nowa€’’eventually it will be sold to those 
who have a demand for security and opacity.
Could bea€”forBTC.

But I cannot see that holding true for Terraa€l

Paragraphs:

From a world societal well-being perspective, a massive and openhanded Marshall plan for Ukraine is 
important for Ukrainian economic recovery and growth, but is more important as a way of greasing 
the skids for an early end to the war started by Putina€™ s attack. My hope is that a cease-fire 
accompanied by some Russian withdrawal could be at the heart of a P steel, with Putin allowed to 
declare victory via international recognition of the reversal of the 1950s
transfer of Crimea from Russia to Ukraine, and with a Marshall Plan and security guarantees making 
that pill not too bitter for Ukraine to swallow. The problem is that Ukraine got its security 
guarantees in 2004, and they turned out to be completely worthless:

Barry Eichengreen: Shaping a Marshall Plan for Ukraine. a€~Aid to Ukraine can start now, though it 
should be used with discretion. Repairing bridges that are simply destroyed again by Russia would 
serve no purposea€!. Recall that Marshall Plan funds were more than 90% grants and just 10% 
loansa€!. The US created an independent agency to administer the Marshall Plana€!. It was able to 
tap private-sector expertise, starting with its head,
Paul Hoffman, the president of Studebaker. It avoided entanglementsa€!. Aid for Ukraine should 
similarly be administered by an autonomous agency accountable to donor governmentsa€!. The Marshall 
Plana€™ s architects recognized the need for ownership on the part of aid recipients, while 
proceeding on the basis of a€oetrust but verify.a€D European governments submitted detailed plans 
for spending down US funds. These were the bases
for painstaking negotiationsa€!. Administrative reforms were a focus and precondition^!. The 
Marshall Plan prioritized rebuilding export capacitya€I. Finally, the Marshall Plan allowed Europe 
to leapfrog a generation technologically. Europe was decades behind the US in adopting the 
a€oehigh-speed throughputa€D manufacturing methods on which the golden age of postwar economic 
growth was baseda€!. Ukraine now similarly has an
opportunity to leapfroga€!. These are first and foremost tasks for the Ukrainians. But the West can 
and should helpa€!

Zero-profit companies are by definition extremely long-duration assets and so extremely sensitive 
to the discount rate. It is not clear to me that what is going on as well-described as a shift in 
sentiment rather than simply as a consequence of duration. But Josh Browna€™ s prose is very fun:

Joshua M. Brown: Attitude Adjustment'. a€~Market capitalizations vanishinga€!. PayPala€! from $300 
billion to $80 billion in just a matter of months. Netflixa€! from 700 dollars per share to under 
200a€!. Cathie Wooda€™ s flagship fund loses 70% of its valuea€!. Small cap biotech down 60%a€!. 
Gene therapy is not even remotely economically cyclical. Doesna€™t matter. Ita€™ s not the 
fundamentals, ita€™ s the sentimenta€!.
Boundless growth, total addressable market, venture-backed, innovative, groundbreaking, web3, 
transformational, disruptivea€! now completely out of the questiona€!. Cashflow is in, imagination 
is outa€!. The unicorns are being gelded, reins pulled in, their horns knocked off with a croquet 
mallet. Fa€” you,la€™m not valuing you ata multiple of how many people there are in the world who 
might give you 8 dollars a month in the year
2027.a€! If you think Tiger Global, down 52% year-to-date, is still going to be writing checks at 
the same velocity as they had been just a year ago, youa€™ re going to be disappointed. Masa Son 
has already told his lieutenants at Softbank to chill out with his capital. The whales are done 
whaling it up for the cycle. Preservation is the word of the daya€!

IMHO, most of what Dani Rodrik sees as wrong with a€oehyperglobalizationa€D came not from the 
a€ceglobalizationa€D part but from the domestic neoliberal plutocratic politics of the age. Yes, 
a€ceglobalizationa€D was a convenient scapegoat for the things that went wrong for the non-A©lite. 
But it was just a scapegoat, not a cause. Hence I interpret this as Dani Rodrik calling for a 
return to hyperglobalization, but this time with sane social democratic domestic
politics:

Dani Rodrik: A Better Globalization Might Rise from Hyper-Globalizationd€™ s Ashes'. a€~The share 
of trade in world GDP began to decline after 2007, as Chinaa€™ s export-to-GDP ratio plummeted by a 
remarkable 16 percentage points. Global value chains stopped spreading. International capital flows 
never recovered to their prea€“2007 heights. And populist politicians openly hostile to 
globalization became much more influentiala€!.
With hyper-globalization having collapsed, scenarios for the world economy run the gamut. The worst 
outcome, recalling the 1930s, would be withdrawal by countries (or groups of countries) into 
autarky. A less bad, but still ugly, possibility is that the supremacy of geopolitics means that 
trade wars and economic sanctions become a permanent featurea€!. The first step is for policymakers 
toa€! reviv[e]a€! the spirit of the Bretton Woods era,
when the global economy served domestic economic and social goalsa€!. A second important 
prerequisite for the good scenario is that countries do not turn a legitimate quest for national 
security into aggression against othersa€!. Our future world need not be one where geopolitics 
trumps everything else and countries (or regional blocs) minimize their economic interactions with 
one another. If that dystopian scenario does materialized! it will
be because we made the wrong choicesa€!

Not sure what I think about this. Putin is not rational, but Putin is a cat that has just sat on a 
hot stove. And the production gap between NATO and Russia is much larger than the gap between 
Germany and Russia was during World War IIa€”rope-a-dope is not a feasible strategy:

Michael Shurkin: a€™ The Russian militarya€™ s shabby performance should not be taken as proof that 
Europe and the US need not worry about Russia, or that Finland and Sweden need not question their 
a€oeneutrality.a€n Why not? First, Russia, for all its operational failings, retains the capacity 
to wreak extraordinary amounts of damage and pain upon its neighbors. It could still flatten Kyiv, 
if it wanted to, and thata€™ s w/o resorting to
nukes. So, Finland for example, could cut the Russian army to pieces, but still would have to 
endure extraordinary hardship and horror. Second, NATO more generally would also cut the Russians 
to pieces, until day 3, when NATO armies run out of ammunition. Russia can still prevail by playing 
a€oerope a dope,a€D i.e. absorbing destruction while staying in the fight. That was more or less 
Russian strategy in WW2. Third, Russians are more
than capable of learning and improving. Therea€™ s zero reason to assume that the next time Russia 
invades a country, it will do so with the same level of ineptitude. Russians ARE NOT stupid. 
Fourth, and most importantly: The Russian invasion proves (as if it wasna€™ t already clear) 
Putina€™ s willingness to eschew inta€™ 1 norms and use military force in a war of aggression. 
Meaning that whatever we may think of how well
anyonea€™ s army might do against Russia, the point is that another war against one of Russiaa€™ s 
neighbors is not implausible. Ita€™ s a real possibility for which those neighbors and their allies 
must preparea€!
