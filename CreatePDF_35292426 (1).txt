Carl von Clausewitz: On War: Friction'. a€~All appears so simple, all the requisite branches of 
knowledge appear so plain, all the combinations so unimportanta€!. But if we have seen war, all 
becomes intelligible; and still, after all, it is extremely difficult to describe what it is which 
brings about this change, to specify this invisible and completely efficient Factor.

Everything is very simple in war, but the simplest thing is difficult. These difficulties 
accumulate and produce a friction, which no man can imagine exactly who has not seen war. Suppose 
now a traveller, who, towards evening, expects to accomplish the two stages at the end of his 
daya€™ s journey, four or five leagues, with post horses, on the high roada€”it is nothing. He 
arrives now at the last station but one, finds no horses, or very bad ones; then a hilly
country, bad roads; it is a dark night, and he is glad when, after a great deal of trouble, he 
reaches the next station, and finds there some miserable accommodation.

So in war, through the influence of an infinity of petty circumstances, which cannot properly be 
described on paper, things disappoint us, and we fall short of the mark. A powerful iron will 
overcomes this friction, it crushes the obstacles, but certainly the machine along with them. We 
shall often meet with this result. Like an obelisk, towards which the principal streets of a place 
converge, the strong will of a proud spirit, stands prominent and commanding, in the
middle of the art of war.

Friction is the only conception which, in a general way, corresponds to that which distinguishes 
real war from war on paper. The military machine, the army and all belonging to it, is in fact 
simple; and appears, on this account, easy to manage. But let us reflect that no part of it is in 
one piece, that it is composed entirely of individuals, each of which keeps up its own friction in 
all directions. Theoretically all sounds very well; the commander of a battalion is
responsible for the execution of the order given; and as the battalion by its discipline is glued 
together into one piece, and the chief must be a man of acknowledged zeal, the beam turns on an 
iron pin with little friction.

But it is not so in reality, and all that is exaggerated and false in such a conception manifests 
itself at once in war. The battalion always remains composed of a number of men, of whom, if chance 
so wills, the most insignificant is able to occasion delay, and even irregularity. The danger which 
war brings with it, the bodily exertions which it requires, augment this evil so much, that they 
may be regarded as the greatest causes of it.

This enormous friction, which is not concentrated, as in mechanics, at a few points, is therefore 
everywhere brought into contact with chance, and thus facts take place upon which it was impossible 
to calculate, their chief origin being chance, As an instance of one such chance, take the weather. 
Here, the fog prevents the enemy from being discovered in time, a battery from firing at the right 
moment, a report from reaching the general; there, the rain prevents a
battalion from arriving, another from reaching in right time, because, instead of three, it had to 
march perhaps eight hours; the cavalry from charging effectively because it is stuck fast in heavy 
ground.

These are only a few incidents of detail by way of elucidation, that the reader may be able to 
follow the author, for whole volumes might be written on these difficulties. To avoid this, and 
still to give a clear conception of the host of small difficulties to be contended with in war, we 
might go on heaping up illustrations, if we were not afraid of being tiresome. But those who have 
already comprehended us will permit us to add a few more.

Activity in war is movement in a resistant medium. Just as a man in water is unable to perform with 
ease and regularity the most natural and simplest movement, that of walking, so in war, with 
ordinary powers, one cannot keep even the line of mediocrity. This is the reason that the correct 
theorist is like a swimming master, who teaches on dry land movements which are required in the 
water, which must appear grotesque and ludicrous to those who forget about
the water. This is also why theorists, who have never plunged in themselves, or who cannot deduce 
any generalities from their experience, are unpractical and even absurd, because they only teach 
what every one knowsa€”how to walk.

Activity in war is movement in a resistant medium. Just as a man in water is unable to perform with 
ease and regularity the most natural and simplest movement, that of walking, so in war, with 
ordinary powers, one cannot keep even the line of mediocrity. This is the reason that the correct

the water. This is also why theorists, who have never plunged in themselves, or who cannot deduce 
any generalities from their experience, are unpractical and even absurd, because they only teach 
what every one knowsa€”how to walk.

Further, every war is rich in particular facts; while, at the same time, each is an unexplored sea, 
full of rocks, which the general may have a suspicion of, but which he has never seen with his eye, 
and round which, moreover, he must steer in the night. If a contrary wind also springs up, that is, 
if any great accidental event declares itself adverse to him, then the most consummate skill, 
presence of mind and energy, are required; whilst to those who only look on
from a distance, all seems to proceed with the utmost ease. The knowledge of this friction is a 
chief part of that so often talked of, experience in war, which is required in a good general. 
Certainly, he is not the best general in whose mind it assumes the greatest dimensions, who is the 
most overawed by it (this includes that class of over-anxious generals, of whom there are so many 
amongst the experienced); but a general must be aware of it that he may overcome
it, where that is possible; and that he may not expect a degree of precision in results which is 
impossible on account of this very friction.

Besides, it can never be learnt theoretically; and if it could, there would still be wanting that 
experience of judgment which is called tact, and which is always more necessary in a field full of 
innumerable small and diversified objects, than in great and decisive cases, when onea€™ s own 
judgment may be aided by consultation with others. Just as the man of the world, through tact of 
judgment which has become habit, speaks, acts, and moves only as suits the
occasion, so the officer, experienced in war, will always, in great and small matters, at every 
pulsation of war as we may say, decide and determine suitably to the occasion. Through this 
experience and practice, the idea comes to his mind of itself, that so and so will not suit. And 
thus he will not easily place himself in a position by which he is compromised, which, if it often 
occurs in war, shakes all the foundations of confidence, and becomes extremely
dangerous.

It is, therefore, this friction, or what is so termed here, which makes that which appears easy in 
war difficult in reality. As we proceed, we shall often meet with this subject again, and it will 
hereafter become plain that, besides experience and a strong will, there are still many other rare 
qualities of the mind required to make a man a consummate generala€!
