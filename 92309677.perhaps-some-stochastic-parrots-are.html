Working across the aisle helped Republicans keep the filibuster alive in a 50-50 Senate by giving… Manchin… and… Sinema… wins…. “[Republican] leadership [did not] try to blow up deals,” Young said… McConnell…. “We wanted… center-right or center-left deals that had broad appeal… but as importantly, kept Sinema and Manchin happy so they didn't join the 'eliminate the filibuster' crowd. It was a wise calculation.” McConnell said much the same…. Passing the bipartisan bills was in the “best interest of the country,” it also “may have reassured” Manchin and Sinema…. Young also suggested CHIPS would have drawn more GOP support under a Republican administration. “I had countless colleagues approach me and say that they believed in this investment and believed it was important to national security and economic security,” he said. “But they shared with me this was a very hard argument for some constituents”…</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/perhaps-some-stochastic-parrots-are?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/perhaps-some-stochastic-parrots-are?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>FOCUS: <strong>Perhaps Some Stochastic Parrots Are Intentional?:</strong></h2><p>“Tell me a story”, I prompt Chat-GPT:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F902605c9-4195-40c7-b8a0-a02eeb8a8450_1322x1702.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F902605c9-4195-40c7-b8a0-a02eeb8a8450_1322x1702.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F902605c9-4195-40c7-b8a0-a02eeb8a8450_1322x1702.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F902605c9-4195-40c7-b8a0-a02eeb8a8450_1322x1702.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F902605c9-4195-40c7-b8a0-a02eeb8a8450_1322x1702.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/902605c9-4195-40c7-b8a0-a02eeb8a8450_1322x1702.jpeg" width="1322" height="1702" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/902605c9-4195-40c7-b8a0-a02eeb8a8450_1322x1702.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1702,&quot;width&quot;:1322,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:375214,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F902605c9-4195-40c7-b8a0-a02eeb8a8450_1322x1702.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F902605c9-4195-40c7-b8a0-a02eeb8a8450_1322x1702.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F902605c9-4195-40c7-b8a0-a02eeb8a8450_1322x1702.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F902605c9-4195-40c7-b8a0-a02eeb8a8450_1322x1702.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>What is Chat-GPT doing here? We are told:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Murray Shanahan</strong>: Talking About Large Language Models &lt;h<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03551.pdf?ref=the-diff">ttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03551.pdf?ref=the-diff</a>&gt; ‘[It] has no communicative intent… no understanding… does not… have beliefs…. All it does, at a fundamental level, is sequence prediction…. Knowing that the word “Burundi” is likely to succeed the words “The country to the south of Rwanda is” is not the same as knowing that Burundi is to the south of Rwanda…. A compelling illusion…. Yet… such systems are fundamentally not like ourselves… present… a patchwork of less-than-human with superhuman capacities, of uncannily human-like with peculiarly inhuman behaviours…. It may require an extensive period of interacting with, of living with, these new kinds of artefact before we learn how best to talk about them. Meanwhile, we should try to resist the siren call of anthropomorphism…</p></blockquote><p>Does this really get it right? Yes, we should resist “the siren call of anthropomorphism”. But is it right to say that there is no <em><strong>intentionality</strong></em> here?</p><p>My punchline: I disagree with Shanahan. There <em><strong>is</strong></em> intentionality. But we have to be precise about just whose.</p><p>Consider: Yes, what Chat-GPT has done in response to my prompt is to predict a sequence of tokens. But what sequence did it predict? </p><p>It took all of the sequences of tokens—words—it has available, all of those in which a human being responded to "tell me a story” in some way, plus some others. It then took those sequences, put them, in a bag, shook them, and printed what came out. Chat-GPT had no intention of “telling me a story”. </p><p>But each of the sequences of tokens that went into Chat-GPT had, attached to it, a human who did intend to tell a story. Thus all the intentions of all the people who ever told a story—they lie behind the token sequences are its raw material. Each of the sequences in its database as intentionality. </p><p>Can there be a sense in which averaging a huge number of speech acts, each of which has intentionality, removes the intentionality?</p><p>Well, no… and yes. Yes, in that what makes things <em><strong>intentional</strong></em> is precisely the individuality of the thought process, and that is what is averaged away. </p><p>But also no…</p><p>Remember the “Chinese-Speaking Room”?</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room#Chinese_room_thought_experiment">Wikipedia</a>: Searle… supposes that he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer program, along with sufficient papers, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output…. Searle himself would not be able to understand the conversation. ("I don't speak a word of Chinese," he points out)...</p></blockquote><p>It is true that if you accept Searle’s framing—a sentence in Chinese comes into the room, and he then consults the books in the room to decide how to respond—then to have the complexity of a human brain, the “Chinese-Speaking Room” would have to be the size of the globe, and managed by 50,000 robots traveling at lightspeed. The system that is the room understands Chinese just as well (or poorly) as a human speaker of Chinese does,</p><p>My view is that Chat-GPT already has that branch of intentionality that humans have when they think “I am going to write a grammatical sentence”, because that intentionality was shared by virtually everyone whose writings have gone into the bag. And, similarly, if we can elicit responses from GPT that are derived from a community of humans every one of which used that response with the same intention, I have no problem ascribing intention to Chat-GPT. </p><p>For example:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank"
