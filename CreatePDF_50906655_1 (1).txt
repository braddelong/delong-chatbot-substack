First: Glory Liu on the Adam Smith Americans Have Imagined

My one-time student Glory Liu has a book coming out: Glory M. Liu (2022): Adam Smitha€™ s America: 
How a Scottish Philosopher Became an Icon of American Capitalism (Princeton: Princeton University 
Press, 978069120381) 
<https://www.amazon.com/Adam-Smiths-America-Philosopher-Capitalism/dp/0691203814>. I recommend it 
very highly
When you read Adam Smith at any length <https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38194/38194-h/38194-h.htm> 
https://www.gutenberg.org/files/67363/67363-h/67363-h.htm>, you keep running across passages like:

The act of navigation is not favourable to foreign commerce, or to the growth ofa€! opulencea€!. As 
defence, however, is of much more importance than opulence, the act of navigation is, perhaps, the 
wisest of all the commercial regulations of Englanda€!

In the progress of the division of labour, the employment of the far greater part ofa€! the people, 
comes to be confined to a few very simple operationsa€! of which the effectsa€! are perhaps 
alwaysa€! very nearly the same.a€! He naturallya€! and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as 
it is possible for a human creature to become. The torpor of his mind renders him not only 
incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational
conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of 
forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life. Of the great 
and extensive interests of his country he is altogether incapable of judginga€! It corrupts even 
the activity of his bodya€!. His dexterity at his own particular trade seems, in this manner, to be 
acquired at the expense of his intellectual, social, and
martial virtuesa€!

The poor mana€™ s sona€! admires the condition of the richa€!. He devotes himself for ever to the 
pursuit of wealth and greatness. To obtain the conveniencies which these afford, he submits in the 
first year, nay in the first month of his application, to more fatigue of body and more uneasiness 
of mind than he could have suffered through the whole of his life from the want of thema€!. Through 
the whole of his life he pursues the idea of
a certain artificial and elegant repose which he may never arrive at, for which he sacrifices a 
real tranquillity that is at all times in his power, and which, if in the extremity of old age he 
should at last attain to it, he will find to be in no respect preferable to that humble security 
and contentment which he had abandoned for it. It is then, in the last dregs of life, his body 
wailed with toil and diseases, his mind galled and ruffled by the memory
of a thousand injuries and disappointments which he imagines he has met with from the injustice of 
his enemies, or from the perfidy and ingratitude of his friends, that he begins at last to find 
that wealth and greatness are mere trinkets of frivolous utilitya€!. In the languor of disease, and 
the weariness of old age, the pleasures of the vain and empty distinctions of greatness 
disappeara€!. Power and riches appear then to be what they
area€! keep off the summer shower, not the winter storm, but leave him always as much, and 
sometimes more exposed than before, to anxiety, to fear, and to sorrow; to diseases, to danger, and 
to deatha€!. And it is well that nature imposes upon us in this manner. It is this deception which 
rouses and keeps in continual motion the industry of mankinda€!

People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the 
conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise pricesa€!

The capital which an Amsterdam merchant employs in carrying corn from Koningsberg to Lisbon, and 
fruit and wine from Lisbon to Koningsberg, must generally be the one half of it at Koningsberg, and 
the other half at Lisbon. No part of it need ever come to Amsterdam. The natural residence of such 
a merchant should either be at Koningsberg or Lisbon; and it can only be some very particular 
circumstances which can make him
prefer the residence of Amsterdam. The uneasiness, however, which he feels at being separated so 
far from his capital, generally determines him to bring part both of the Koningsberg goods which he 
destines for the market of Lisbon, and of the Lisbon goods which he destines for that of 
Koningsberg, to Amsterdam; and though this necessarily subjects him to a double charge of loading 
and unloading as well as to the payment of some
duties and customs, yet, for the sake of having some part of his capital always under his own view 
and command, he willingly submits to this extraordinary charge; and it is in this manner that every 
country which has any considerable share of the carrying trade, becomes always the emporium, or 
general market, for the goods of all the different countries whose trade it carries ona€!

Isa€! improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of the people to be regarded as an 
advantage, or as an inconveniency, to the society?a€! No society can surely be flourishing and 
happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, 
besides, that they who feed, clothe, and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a 
share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves
tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodgeda€!

This is a snarky Scottish Enlightenment moral philosopher, well aware of quirks of human psychology 
and sociology.

So how is it that Adam Smith in America wound up as the poster child for the a€oestark utopiaa€D of 
the free-market order? How is it that he is the guy who is taken to have said that a good society 
is one in which all of the social power you exercise to command the work and attention of others is 
mediated through the market? A market society is one in which all the social power one exerts to 
attempt to command the aims of the work of society is deployed
through your effective demanda€”and so is equal to your wealth times your personal intensity of 
desire that some commodity be made for your personal use. This is a fine thing to do, but only if 
the only end of society is to produce commodities for its individualsa€™ personal utilization, and 
only if the societal value placed on the happiness of an individual is proportional to his wealth.

But that is simply not the case.

Glory tells the story of how this transformation of Adam Smith was accomplished, here in America.

It is a wonderful story. I have not fully digested what I think the big-think conclusions that I 
draw from her book are. But one of the excellences of a rich book is that it provides different 
big-think conclusions for a large number of people, coming at the book from different places than 
the author. (If you want to know from what position I am coming to thisa€”which is different from 
where Glory is coming froma€”see:

Paragraphs:

Not GDP per capita, but rather GDP per capita times the square-root of population adjusted for the 
share of world resources engrossed should be the variable we focus on in studies of a€cegreata€D 
and a€celittlea€D divergence. I think this is great from Steve. But take this as a tickler that I 
am going to try to do better this summer:

Stephen Broadberry: Accounting for the Great Divergence: Recent Findings from Historical National 
Accounting'. a€~New estimates of GDP per capita for three leading nations in Europe and two in 
Asiaa€! point to substantial regional variationa€! a European Little Divergence, as Britain and the 
Netherlands overtook Italy. Starting out from a lower level of GDP per capita, both Britain and the 
Netherlands received a permanent boost
to per capita incomes after the Black Death of the mida€“14th century, and the Netherlands forged 
ahead of Italy in the 16th century during its Golden Age, while Britain overtook Italy in the early 
18th century and the Netherlands at the beginning of the 19th century. Second, there was an Asian 
Little Divergence as Japan overtook Chinaa€!. I also offer ana€! explanation^!. Proximate 
factorsa€! include the growth of the labour force,
increased labour effort, more cultivated land, investment in both human capital and physical 
capital, the growth of total factor productivity (TFP) and structural changea€! the growth of 
labour productivity in terms of human capital deepening, capital deepening, changes in the 
land-labour ratio and growing efficiencya€!. Ingenuity rather than abstention governed the Great 
Divergence, which was due to more efficient use of factor
inputsa€!. Britaina€™ s unique factor price combination of high wages and low energy prices 
stimulated technological progress that was labour-saving and coal-usinga€!

It looks like here we had a very bad political decision not to prosecute Donald Trump:

Leaked Resignation Letter Squeezes Manhattan DA, Who Suspended Trump Case, Between a Rock & a Very 
Hard Place'. a€~Alvin Bragga€! suspended the Trump case. Afterward, Pomerantz and another 
prosecutor quita€!. Pomerantza€™ s resignation lettera€i. The evidence, Pomerantz said, would show 
Trump is a€oeguilty of numerous felony violations of the Penal Lawa€D before hea€™ d become 
president. He went on: a€oeHis
financial statements were false, and he has a long history of fabricating information relating to 
his personal finances and lying about his assets to banks, the national media, counterparties, and 
many others, including the American people. The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors 
no doubt about whether he committed crimesa€”he did.a€D Pomerantz did not lay out evidence against 
the former president but did say it was
strong enough to show a€oeguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.a€D He added: a€oeWe believe that the 
prosecution would prevail if charges were brought and the matter were tried to an impartial 
jury.a€Da€l If Bragg fears the political consequences of losing, as all district attorneys do, he 
should fear even more the political consequences of failing to try. a€oe Whatever the risks of 
bringing the case may be,a€D Pomerantz said, a€oel am
convinced that a failure to prosecute will pose much greater risks in terms of public confidence in 
the fair administration of justice "a€!

Not calling it a€oeglobal warminga€D is, I think, a bad sign. And the extent to which 
a€oedemographic changea€D is a problem rather than an opportunity:

Olivier Blanchard & Jean Tirole: Major Future Economic Challenges'. a€~The challenges of climate 
change, inequality and demographic change are significant, [but] solutionsa€’’though sometimes 
expensive or unpalatablea€”exista€!. All three of our challenges are time bombs. Their immediate 
effects are much weaker than their long-term ones, and so decision-makers procrastinatea€!. They

that if policymakers are to make those hard decisions, they must do this under uncertainty and

Abolutely brutal with respect to the incompetence and the cruelty of the Swedish rA©gime:

a€~During 2020, however, Sweden had ten times higher COVIDa€“19 death rates compared with 
neighbouring Norwaya€!. Scientific methodology was not followed by the major figures in the acting 
authoritiesa€”or the responsible politiciansa€”with alternative narratives being considered as 
valida€!. The Public Health Agency
labelled advice from national scientists and international authorities as extreme positions, 
resulting in media and political bodies to accept their own policy instead. The Swedish people were 
kept in ignorance of basic facts such as the airborne SARS-CoVa€“2 transmission, that asymptomatic 
individuals can be contagious and that face masks protect both the carrier and others. Mandatory 
legislation was seldom used; recommendations
relying upon personal responsibility and without any sanctions were the norm. Many elderly people 
were administered morphine instead of oxygen despite available supplies, effectively ending their 
lives. If Sweden wants to do better in future pandemics, the scientific method must be 
re-established, not least within the Public Health Agencya€!

a€oel lecture for free; the university pays me to gradea€!a€D is a very good peg on which to hang 
the usefulness of the university. After all, it started as a way to use reading-aloud to groups as 
a way to economize on very expensive and very scarce books. Yet Gutenberga€™ s coming did not upset 
it. Afterwards, it went from strength to strength even though its original raison da€™ etre had 
vanished:

Chad Orzel: Imminent Death of the Academy Predicted'. a€~The basic claim here is the usual a€oeYou 
can learn what you need to be a successful tech person without all the expensive ancillary nonsense 
that comes with modern higher education.a€D And, again, this is true in a narrowly literal 
sensea€”ita€™ s absolutely possible for a smart and highly motivated individual to learn the skills 
they need on their own time, without the
formal structure of academia. Many people have done it over the years, and most of them are happy 
to tell you about it at tedious length. The fundamental problem here is that the number of people 
who think theya€™ re the right sort of highly motivated autodidact to bypass academia is at least 
one and probably more like two orders of magnitude larger than the number of people who really are 
that sorta€!. The whole elaborate edifice of
lectures and homework sets and exams and grades is there to provide the extrinsic motivation 
necessary to get a typical student to put in the work that leads to genuine mastery. You absolutely 
do not need the assistance of a tenured faculty member to achieve a good undergraduate-level 
education in most subjectsa€’’there are libraries full of books and an Internet full of other 
resources that can provide all the raw information. The
motivation  to work out all the end-of-chapter problems in the textbook without peeking at the 
solutions online is a lot harder to come by. In a lot of ways, the whole system is justified by a 
slightly different spin on the old academic joke, a€oel lecture for free; the university pays me to 
gradea€Da€!

This is 100% correct. Workers wona€™ t bargain for locked-in wage increases until they expect 
ongoing moderate inflation. Workers wona€™t expect ongoing moderate inflation until by osmosis they 
have picked up that expectation from the bond market. And the bond market does not expect that, not 
at all. We have three big processes that need to take place before an inflationary wage-price 
spiral will be at hand:

Paul Krugman: a€™ People worrying about a return to 70s-type stagflation should look beyond the 
macro series and look at what wage- and price-setters were doinga€!. Employers were locking in 
large, multi-year cost increases because everyone expected high inflation to continue indefinitely, 
so their competitors would be in the same position. That was why disinflation^’’which came as a big 
surprisea€”was so costly. Nothing like
that is happening now. Large wage increases for some workers, but ita€™ s just supply and demand, 
not expected future inflation. Medium-term inflation expectations mostly anchored a€” rising 
breakevens mainly reflect current oil shock. So a relatively soft landing is still very much 
possible. The Feda€™ s belief that it can happen without any uptick in unemployment is dubious. But 
if youa€™re going to tell 70s scare stories, get the
history righta€!

SUBJECT: The Lack of Full Cross-Society Diffusion of Industrial Technologies

Most conspicuous today among the failures of global economic management is the extraordinary 
failure of the technologies that have been developed since 1770 to fully diffuse across the world. 
The industrial innovations had their initial start in the Dover Circle: 300 miles in radius, 
centered on the port of Dover in the southeastern corner of England.

Between-Society Inequality


2022-02-11 Fr

Technologies and institutions were then carried and diffused via natural increase, conquest, 
settlement, emulation, osmosis, and diffusion thought the world. But only partially and 
incompletely. The result is that today there is a thing called the a€oeglobal northa€D, which, in 
its imagination at leas,t traces continuity of descent and commonality of identity in some sense 
with the civilizations of the Dover-Circle societies of half a millennium agoa€”a day when
the Dover Circle was nothing special, and no prince or merchant of the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, 
Ganges, Indus, Syr Amu, Syr Daria, Tigris, Euphrates, or Nile valleys would have wanted to change 
places with their counterparts of the Rhine, Meuse, Seine, or Thames.

The result is that there is today a thing called the a€oeglobal southa€D, which is the rest of the 
world, which stood, on average, at least at par with the people of the Dover Circle in income and 
technology 500 years ago, who today have average incomes less than 20% as high.

This between-society inequality may or may not now be in a process of long-term erosion. But it 
certainly was in a process of tremendous expansiona€”divergencea€”from 1800 to at least 1980. The 
current 4.5-1 edge of the global north relative to the world average is principally due to the 
differential creation and adoption of technologies, and secondarily but substantially due to the 
engrossment of the worlda€™ s natural resources: conquest, occupation,
extortion, and purchase.

Simon Kuznets in his Nobel Prize lecture back in 1971 pointed to:

Factorsa€! [that] have limited the spread of modern economic growtha€!. Japan is the only nation 
outside of those rooted in European civilization that has joined the group of developed 
countriesa€!. The increasingly national cast of organization in developed countries made for 
policiesa€! clearly inhibiting [convergence] a€! colonial statusa€! imperialist exploitationa€! 
[neutralizing] the remarkable institutions by which the Sinic and
East Indian civilizations produced the unified, huge societies that dwarfed in size any that 
originated in Europe until recentlya€!. Nor is the social technology that evolved in the developed 
countries likely to provide models of institutions or arrangements suitable to the diverse 
institutional and population-size backgrounds of many less developed countriesa€!. It will not be a 
matter of merely borrowing existing tools, material and social;
or of directly applying past patterns of growth, merely allowing for the difference in parameters. 
The innovational requirements are likely to be particularly great in the social and political 
structuresa€!. A long period of experimentation and struggle toward a viable political framework 
compatible with adequate economic growth lies ahead for most less developed countries of today; and 
this process will become more intensive and acute
as the perceived gap widens between what has been attained and what is attainable with modern 
economic growtha€!

Nothing in the history of the past half-centurya€’’especially not the institutional dysfunctions we 
clearly see in much of the global northa€”suggests that these worries by Simon were overstated.

We can compare our guesses as to the state of the Dover Circle to our guesses as to the world as a 
whole since the year 800. These are more than guessesa€”it is not quite fair to call them guesses. 
But they are close to guesses. So take them with a grain of salt. The Dover Circle goes from 
perhaps 20% behind the world average in terms of its deployment of useful ideas to perhaps 15% 
above, or maybe a little less, between 800 and 1500. This is somewhat of a
puzzle. We understand why the louver circle is behind the world average in 800. Its population 
density is low because it is heavily forested. Well, the land is fertile, the trees are hard to cut 
down to make fields, and not worth cutting down until you have the heavy plows that can break up 
the clayish soils and the horse collars to allow the piles to be pulled efficiently. Low population 
density brings low urbanization which means ideas do not spread that rapidly,
and the political-military chaos from the absence of large empires and imperial peace means that 
what ideas are broadly known are hard to deploy.

This, however, has changed by 1500: now it is a world civilization more-or-less like any 
othera€’’behind the world frontier in some things (scale and organization, fine textiles and 
ceramics) and ahead in others (precision metalworking, gunpowder weapons, ships for sailing rough 
oceans in all seasons).

Then, around 1500, there comes a sea-change for the world: the crossing of the watershed-boundary 
that takes the world into the Imperial-Commercial Age. The rate of ideas growth in the world as a 
whole triples, from 5% to 15% per century. This will drive, worldwide, a jump in the average rate 
of population growth from 10% to 30% per century. The overwhelming share of this jump-up rings from 
the impact of globalization, in the expanded trade and ideas
flow and then deployment of technologies to grasp the expanded opportunities of comparative 
advantage opened upa€’’primarily those of the Columbian Exchange, the transfers of biotechnology 
from the Old to the New and from the New to the Old World.

if you were lucky, and that is if you were lucky enough not to live in what is now Latin America as 
the conky stories came through and then dominated not to live in slavery afflicted Africa, not to 
five in someplace where Europeans made negative bids for resources in Cannon. If say you were lucky 
enough to live someplace else, the commercial Imperial age from 1500 to 1770. So the fastest and 
most widely distributed economic growth up to that date, ideas
growth, largely due to the Columbian in biotechnology exchange more than twice as rapid as any 
previous era, for the West in quotation marks again edge in quotation marks, I guess, over 1500 to 
1770 was primarily military organizational that as the 0.26% per year steady increase in the share 
of the world's resources in engrosses. The west edge over 1500 to 1770 was secondarily inventive 
deployment. That is the 0.05% per year pulling ahead and ideas
invented and deployed. The institutional configuration and the cultural configuration of the West 
mattered from 1500 to 1770. But it did not yet matter a great deal at this economic prosperity 
level of analysis. A bigger shift a much bigger shift was to come with the coming of the British 
Industrial Revolution Age starting around 1770.

The Dover Circle shares in this upward jump in ideas discovery, development, deployment, and 
diffusion: Its pace of ideas growth retains its 5%-point per century edge over the world average, 
doubling from 10% percent rate to 20% per century. A value of ideas deployed in the Dover Circle 
that was 10-15% above the world average in 1500 is 25-30% above the world average come 1770. Bigger 
gaps, however, open between the Dover Circle and the rest of the
world than just the gap in ideas. Total Dover Circle economic product jumps from growing at 18% per 
century before 1500 to more than 50% per century afterwards. For the world as a whole, the jump is 
much smaller: from 10% per century to a bit over 20%. This differential jump means that the 
relative salience of Dover Circle economic product is amplified by a factor of 2 1/2 over the 1500 
to 1770 imperial commercial age. This increasing salience is driven
secondarily by the 5%-point per century edge in ideas deployment and diffusion, but primarily by a 
25%-point per century edge as the Dover Circle engrosses, via conquest, exploitation, settlement, 
and purchase, a greater share of the worlds total natural resources than merely those that were 
physically located inside the Dover Circle in 1500.

This divergence process would continue after 1770. During the 1770 to 1870 industrial revolution 
age, the Dover Circle has a 5%-point per decade edge over the 4% per decade worldwide ideas growth 
average. And the Dover Circle has a further 4% per decade edge generated by additional resource 
engrossment. The 1872 2010 modern economic growth age sees the Dover Circle have a 3.3%-point per 
decade edge in ideas, and a 1.7%-point per decade edge in
yet further resource engrossment. And so all this transforms a Dover Circle in the same league as 
the world average in 1500 to a set of economies 4.5 times as prosperous today, and economies that 
held 2.5% of the worlda€™ s population in 1500 have grown, via expansion, settlement, and 
emulation, to a peak of perhaps 15% of the worlda€™ s population in 1870 and now 11% of the 
worlda€™ s population today.

Simon Kuznets in his Nobel Prize lecture back in 1971 pointed to:

Factorsa€! [that] have limited the spread of modern economic growtha€!. Japan is the only nation 
outside of those rooted in European civilization that has joined the group of developed 
countriesa€!. The increasingly national cast of organization in developed countries made for 
policiesa€! clearly inhibiting [convergence] a€! colonial statusa€! imperialist exploitationa€! 
[neutralizing] the remarkable institutions by which the Sinic and
East Indian civilizations produced the unified, huge societies that dwarfed in size any that 
originated in Europe until recentlya€!. Nor is the social technology that evolved in the developed 
countries likely to provide models of institutions or arrangements suitable to the diverse 
institutional and population-size backgrounds of many less developed countriesa€!. It will not be a 
matter of merely borrowing existing tools, material and social;
or of directly applying past patterns of growth, merely allowing for the difference in parameters.
