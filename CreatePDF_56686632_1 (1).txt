have every reason at the end of this war to conclude that Vladimir Putin took them into an unjust 
war in which they suffered disastrous defeats. That saida€! there needs to be some way back and at 
least parts of that way back cannot be contingent upon regime change in Moscow. Folks also arena€™

that we want to seea€!

The second half of this seems to me to be righta€”the way to bet for the medium- and long-run is 
that we are still in a regime of secular stagnation.
But that seems to me to make the first half wrong and, indeed, incomprehensible.

In any reasonable societal well-being function, short run inflation has significant costs only if 
it destroys the long-run inflation anchor. And it has not done so. Not passing the early 2021 
fiscal package, or having the federal reserve immediately respond by raising interest rates a year 
ago, would have slowed down the recovery: a serious loss. And it would have produced no gain: no 
societal well-being benefits that I can see.
And I have not even gotten to the asymmetric loss function point, which is also decisive: The 
Federal Reserve can deal with an overheated economy. It cannot deal with a frozen one:

Olivier Blanchard: Economists Exchange'. a€~I didna€™ t anticipate the role of the goods market, 
which is that in many sectors the strong demand led to supply disruptions and very large increases 
in prices. In the end, inflation came first not from where I would have expected it to come, which 
was wages, but rather from pricesa€!. I think that the increase in prices, the disruptions in 
supply chains, are very much the result of strong
demand hitting supply walls. So, I would claim that I should get a few points for being right in 
February or March of 2021. Anybody could have come to the same conclusion. Ia€™ m happy I dida€!. 
What should the Fed have done or said when the fiscal package was passed? I hope that Jay Powell 
picked up his phone and told the administration that this was going to be an issue. His staff drank 
the Kool-Aid, and he, not being a
professional economist, could not easily second-guess them. They thought inflation expectations 
would remain anchored and that the Phillips curve was flata€!. The question is, indeed, how much of 
this is a blip. I use the word bump, which I think has a slightly longer length than a blip. But I 
believe we will then go back to low real interest rates. So, on this, Ia€™ m going to do the Larry 
Summers thing. I am going to say, with
probability                                                                                         
                                                                                                    
0.9, wea€™ 11 return to something like that world. I think therea€™ s a tendency for markets to 
focus on the current, on the present and extrapolate it forever. But if I look at the factors 
behind the decline in real interest rates since the mida€“1980s, none of them seems about to turn 
around, except perhaps one, which is investment^!

The Economist joins those who think that Xi Jinping's policies are not sidestepping but instead 
falling deeper into the middle-income trap:

The Economist: How Xi Jinping Is Damaging Chinaa€™ s Economy: a€~Inflexible policies are trumping 
pragmatisma€!. Ideological zeal is behinda€! economic initiatives that form what Mr Xi calls his 
a€oenew development concepta€D, which is meant to address a€oegreat changes unseen in a 
centurya€Ua€! to tackle inequality, monopolies and debt, and to ensure that China dominates new 
technologies and is fortified against
Western sanctions. Yet in all cases Mr Xi believes the party must take the lead, and implementation 
has been punitive and erratic. A blizzard of fines, new regulations and purgesa€!. A savage but 
incomplete crackdown on the property sector, responsible for over a fifth of gdp, has led to a 
funding cruncha€”one reason why housing sales fell by 47% in April compared with a year earliera€!. 
Xia€™ s economic modela€! involves
expanding  the scope of the least productive part of the economy: the government-run one. Chinaa€™ 
s industrial policy has had formidable successes, for example building a dominant global position 
in advanced batteries. Mr Xi hopes that technology and a new cohort of state investment funds will 
make decision-making more agile. But dona€™ t forget all the dismal failures, from rust-belt 
industries to microchipsa€!. To the extent it
can   be discerned from the black box of elite politics, there is no rival to Mr Xi, who is 68. Yet 
in the run-up to a party congress that may see him secure power until at least 2027, the 
shortcomings of one-man rule in the worlda€™ s second-largest economy are glaringa€!

Amazing chutzpah:

Matt Levine: Terra Is Back From Bankruptcy: a€~The new Terra blockchain will start running a coin 
under the existing Luna name and ticker, and wona€™ t include the TerraUSD stablecoina€!. In aa€! 
crypto bankruptcy? a€! there is no guarantee of anythinga€!. In traditional finance terms, Terra 
went bankrupt, and reorganized, and its shareholders got more of a recovery than its creditors. Not 
how things work in traditional
bankruptcy !a€! Some holders of UST got paid roughly $1 for their UST out of the LFG money, and 
some did not and held through the collapse. If you are a suspicious person, you might ask questions 
like a€oewait, were certain favored insiders cashed out at $1 while other retail bagholders got 
nothing?a€D But if you are a traditional finance person, you might ask simpler questions like 
a€oewhy should anyone have been cashed out at

$1 when there clearly wasna€™t enough money to go around?a€Da€!

The natural next question is: for what uses can we know quickly repurpose all of our half-empty 
office buildings?:

between central and peripheral areas, and we have a housing market thata€™ s bursting at the seams 
because people dona€™ t want to work remotely from a crowded kitchen table or a room thata€™ s full 
of kidsa€™ toysa€!. Buildings are expensive and time-consuming to make and they also last a long 
time. Having a very sudden shift
in what kinds of buildings people want (fewer offices and bigger houses) is a big pain economically 
because completely transforming the national building stock is harda€!

A fascinating paper that I need to work much harder to fully digest:

Edmund J. Malesky: Enhancing the Literature on Authoritarian Regimes through Detailed Comparisons 
of China and Vietnam'. a€~In exploring the role of factions, personalism, and legislative behavior 
in the two states, the three contributions in this issue dispense with the simplistic notion of a 
China or Vietnam a€ceModela€D of political economy, but instead explain the politics behind how 
leaders are chosen and how legislative
decisions are made and implemented. All three are explicitly comparative, documenting clear 
differences between the states and showing how these matter for explaining puzzles in critical 
political outcomes. As I argue in this essay, the insights of these three papers are important for 
more than just broadening area studies expertise, but for the burgeoning literature on 
authoritarian regimes, which has tended to black-box countries,
insufficiently accounting for subtle institutional differences and variation in the policy 
preferences of elite actors. In this essay, I explore the unique contributions of each article to 
larger debates in comparative politics. I conclude by arguing for a unified theory that can help us 
better understand why these systems have been so successful in good times and resilient in hard 
timesa€!
