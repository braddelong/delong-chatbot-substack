It would spend enormously on the most conventional infrastructure projects, such as bridge and road repair ($115 billion), ports and airports ($42 billion) and public transit, Amtrak and freight rail ($165 billion). </p><p>But… the… distinction Noem drew… between “infrastructure” on one hand, and “research and development” and “green energy”…. Republicans and Democrats, it turns out, have deep differences over what constitutes “infrastructure.”… Republican lawmakers have increasingly equated infrastructure with new highways that connect rural communities and promote exurban sprawl…. But they see most of what Biden proposed as “Democratic infrastructure”…. </p><p>[But] back during the Eisenhower era, Republicans widely supported large public investments in big projects such as the interstate highway system. But they also supported big investments in research and development, in the technologies of the future and in education for the express purpose of facilitating future national development. “After the launch of Sputnik, for the federal government to spend whatever it took to produce universities and scientists and high technology became priority No. 1 of the Republican Party…” economist Brad Delong told me. “Education and engineering in high technology became the key piece of lacking American infrastructure that the Eisenhower administration wanted to create,” continued DeLong, the co-author of a book about government’s role in reshaping the economy at key historical moments. Republicans at the time viewed this as “essential to America achieving its national purposes,” DeLong said… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/01/kristi-noem-hannity-biden-infrastructure-plan/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/01/kristi-noem-hannity-biden-infrastructure-plan/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>The book, written with <strong>Stephen S. Cohen</strong>, is <em>Concrete Economics: The Hamilton Approach to Economic Policy </em>&lt;<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Concrete_Economics/BXoyBgAAQBAJ">https://www.google.com/books/edition/Concrete_Economics/BXoyBgAAQBAJ</a>&gt;. It was a plea for pragmatism rather than ideology in political economy—and a <em>sotto voce </em>word of advice to Republicans to return their party to what it was before Goldwater cursed them and enslaved them to the demons of racism. Back then they thought the point was to make the American economy stronger, more dynamic, and more rapidly changing, because we are a frontier people and today’s frontiers are technological. And, yes, there would be some big winners, but (a) that was a positive point and (b) in the long run nearly everyone would be a winner. Now the Republican Party has become a party of plutocrats and white racists who greatly fear change and dynamism, because for the plutocrats—especially the heirs and heiresses—growth, dynamism, and change are their enemies because it is their wealth that dynamic Schumpeterian capitalism creatively destroys, and because for the racists growth, dynamism, and change brings the possibility that people who look different will not bow heads but instead will look them in the eye.</p><div><hr></div><p>Joshua Gans agrees with me: much better for people with things to say to be on SubStack rather than working as sideshow acts for advertisers. SubStack and company look, to me, like a substantial intellectual win. But will the Gods of the Marketplace be tolerant enough for it to be self-sustainable?:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Joshua Gans</strong>:&nbsp;<em>’I have noticed</em>&nbsp;that the journalists/opinion writers who have migrated to Substack are writing better pieces than they have in years. They are up in terms of length, reading age-level and complexity of arguments. I think this is a consequence of the change in underlying business model. When you sell ads, you need views. That means you want a product that attracts the marginal customer. When you sell subscriptions, that may seem to also hold but it doesn’t. That’s because a subscription is not a payment for an individual unit but instead a payment for a bundle. To keep people subscribed to the bundle, people have to be attracted to the average rather than the marginal attracting people. That, combined with the lack of an intermediary, means that the scale of a substack is much lower and more niche than ad-based outlets. Hence, for people I consumed even when they were edited/commercialised, I am happier now when they are not. For others, I can’t tell (yet)… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/joshgans/status/1377242922236719105">https://twitter.com/joshgans/status/1377242922236719105</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Steve M. thinks that the “pipes aren’t really infrastructure” line of attack will be unsuccessful, because stupid. But the question is whether or not it is too stupid for the Lester Holts and the Chuck Todds and the other media gatekeepers who have had their moral sense excised by surgical operation will find it too stupid to amplify with their megaphones. The jury is still out on that;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Steve M.</strong>:&nbsp;<em>New Right-Wing Talking Point: Evil Libs Want You to Think Buildings Are Infrastructure!</em>: ‘Let’s not mock Governor Noem for this—it’s not just her talking point.

Such agreements should be made permanent, broadened… and strengthened to ensure the EU won’t revoke access suddenly and unilaterally.
