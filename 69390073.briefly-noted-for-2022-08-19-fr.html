But it is not a perfect book. So would I be mean, jealous, and envious to think that it is punching above its weight?</p><p>The book is a combination of history, politics, a primer on Derrick Parfit, and a great deal of wise things said about how to effectively do good. It consists 3/4 of very good and clever observations.</p><p>It has some  claims I find strange: principally that the future of the world is “causally thin” in our generation—that whatever patterns we impose on human society cannot or will not be undone by the many trillions of us who will live in the future—and that moral philosophy and moral philosophers are particularly key (as moral philosophy is likely to be the most fixed). Hence not only are we special people with unique powers and influence, but among us moral philosophers are very special people with immense powers and influence never to be matched in all of future history. This seems grandiose, and if it diverts resources from the bottom billion to exploring outer space I wouls be worried. But worry about, and action to benefit, the future does not crowd out, much, action to benefit the present. </p><p>Plus there are excursions into Rapture of the Nerds and Roko’s Basilisk thought: arguments that I have never been able to understand as anything.</p><p>As I said, I do think Matt Yglesias has it right here: there is certainly a book to be written about AI-threat. There is certainly a book to be written about Longtermism. They are not the same book—save for the fact that Longtermists, like all other people, think that the extinction of the human species within our own expected natural lifetimes is something we should take substantial care to avoid. Yet the Longtermist book, and the AI-threat book, and several other books are mashed together in a short book. And that means that each piece of it leaves me unsatisfied, and wanting more.</p><p>Because it seems to me that it is more sketches of five books bound together than a single book, it does seem to me that its launch is punching above its weight. </p><p>And I want my book &lt;<a href="http://bit.ly/3pP3Krk">bit.ly/3pP3Krk</a>&gt; to punch above its weight too.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=ae2208ae&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 50% off for 1 year&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=ae2208ae"><span>Get 50% off for 1 year</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>Here we have a justifiably arrogant author placing his chips:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Thoukydides the Athenian</strong>: <em>The Peloponnesian War:</em> ‘The absence of the fabulous in my history will, I fear, detract somewhat from its interest; but if it be judged useful by those inquirers who desire an exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation of the future, which in the course of human things must resemble if it does not reflect it, I shall be content. </p><p>In sum, I have written my work, not as a ticket-punch or to win transitory applause in the moment, but as a treasure for all time.</p><p> καὶ ἐς μὲν ἀκρόασιν ἴσως τὸ μὴ μυθῶδες αὐτῶν ἀτερπέστερον φανεῖται: ὅσοι δὲ βουλήσονται τῶν τε γενομένων τὸ σαφὲς σκοπεῖν καὶ τῶν μελλόντων ποτὲ αὖθις κατὰ τὸ ἀνθρώπινον τοιούτων καὶ παραπλησίων ἔσεσθαι, ὠφέλιμα κρίνειν αὐτὰ ἀρκούντως ἕξει. </p><p>κτῆμά τε ἐς αἰεὶ μᾶλλον ἢ ἀγώνισμα ἐς τὸ παραχρῆμα ἀκούειν ξύγκειται</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D22%3Asection%3D4">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D22%3Asection%3D4</a>&gt; I.22.4</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Still musing over that AHA Presidential Column…</p><blockquote><p><strong>James Sweet</strong>: <em>Is History History?: Identity Politics and Teleologies of the Present</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/september-2022/is-history-history-identity-politics-and-teleologies-of-the-present">https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/september-2022/is-history-history-identity-politics-and-teleologies-of-the-present</a>&gt;: ‘[In a Ghana hotel,] African Americans began trickling into the breakfast bar… more than a dozen members of the same family—three generations deep…. In front of one of the elders was a dog-eared copy of <em>The 1619 Project</em>…. My family and I toured Elmina Castle alongside several Ghanaians, a Dane, and a Jamaican family. Our guide gave a well-rehearsed tour geared toward African Americans…. I am troubled…. Less than one percent of the Africans passing through Elmina arrived in North America…. Should the guide’s story differ for a tour with no African Americans? Likewise, would <em>The 1619 Project</em> tell a different history if it took into consideration that the shipboard kin of Jamestown’s “20. and odd” Africans also went to Mexico, Jamaica, and Bermuda?… Do efforts to claim a usable African American past reify elements of American hegemony and exceptionalism such narratives aim to dismantle?…</p></blockquote><p>At least as I see it, James Sweet appears to have three complaints here:</p><ol><li><p>The <em>1619 Project</em> should have been a general history of Atlantic slavery and its ramifications, rather than focused on America and the experience of African-Americans under the harrow.</p></li><li><p>Ghanaian tour guides should tune their presentations to the concerns of their actual audiences, rather than have one—African-American-oriented—presentation chosen because that is what the bulk of those who come to Elmina Castle with the bulk of the money are eager to learn about.</p></li><li><p>In coming to Elmina castle with money, wanting to learn about their ancestors, African-Americans are engaged in acts of imperialism and domination.</p></li></ol><p>To which my reaction is: Is this for reals? I guess I need to pay more attention to Bari Weiss than I had thought.

Let me try to lay out what I think it is:</p></li></ul><p>For most of recorded human history, humanity was desperately poor. The level of technology, the size of the population, and the available natural resources meant that it was impossible for everyone to have <em><strong>enough</strong></em>. Indeed, the only way that even some people could have <em><strong>enough</strong></em> was via their becoming part of an élite, and constructing, operating, and maintaining an exploitation-and-domination machine that, by force and fraud, took a great deal of what other people made, and grabbed it for themselves and their allies in the élite. </p><p>Now, most of <em><strong>recorded</strong></em> human history as written by historians who are not archæologists is history that listens to the voices of the members of this élite, for they were the literate ones, or ones whose deeds were of interest and immediate concern to the literate: the thugs-with-spears, and their tame bureaucrats, accountants, and propagandists, as they came into conflict and worked in cooperation with each other to acquire, distribute, and utilize the extracted surplus. It is a history that is primarily of those who benefited from the operation of the exploitation-and-domination machine. </p><p>In this context, cries “the mores  of those in the past were different from ours!” and that we should not judge them are mostly demands that we not focus too much on the exploitation and domination machine and its operation and justification, but rather look at high cultural productions and political maneuverings as the proper domain of history. But I see no justification for that other than: “I am in a position of authority, and that is how it is convenient for me for things to be.”</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2022-08-19-fr/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2022-08-19-fr/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 25% off a group subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48"><span>Get 25% off a group subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donate Subscriptions&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true"><span>Donate Subscriptions</span></a></p><div class="install-substack-app-embed"><img class="install-substack-app-embed-img" src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png"><div class="install-substack-app-embed-text"><div class="install-substack-app-header">Read Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality in the Substack app</div><div class="install-substack-app-text">Available for iOS and Android</div></div><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_context=author-post-insert" target="_blank" class="install-substack-app-embed-link"><button class="install-substack-app-embed-btn button primary">Get the app</button></a></div><h6>I greatly enjoy and am, in fact, driven to write Grasping Reality—but its long-term viability and quality do depend on voluntary subscriptions from paying supporters.
