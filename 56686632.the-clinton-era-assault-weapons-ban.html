We were trying to construct a coalition for a "crime bill"—tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime. Bob Dole in the Senate and Bob Michel in the House declared that we would get no help from Republicans: that they would try to keep us to zero Republican votes. The point, they said, was that they had to try their best to make Clinton look like a failure. If that meant that none of America's problems would be addressed unless they could be made to look like a Clinton surrender to Republicans, that was fine. This was politics, not a tea party. And, anyway, Clinton was not legitimate: a minority president, who had squeaked in only because Ross Perot had blown up the 1992 race.</p><p>Treasury was heavily involved. We were, after all, "the money". And the Bureau of ATF was a pretty big component of federal law enforcement. So we went on a listening tour, asking people over and over again what they thought would actually reduce crime, and what they thought would actually reduce the causes of crime.</p><p>One thing that became clear, from rural sheriffs and deputies and big-city police departments alike, was that the cops were starting to get scared. They were getting scared that they were going to run into bad guys with military-grade amounts of automatic firepower, and get killed. There was unified buy-in from law enforcement nationwide that, while people really did disagree about "gun control", an assault weapons ban made sense.</p><p>We added it to the bill, and we held enough of the Democratic caucuses to push the Clinton crime bill, with all of its constructive and destructive elements, across the finish line.</p><p>And then Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House.</p><p>And he saw the assault weapons ban as a point of vulnerability—as something that he could unify the Republican Party around as an unwarranted and authoritarian violation of Americans' rights. And he made it so. And the Republicans all followed this pied piper into full-throated support of an AR-15 in the hands of every emotionally fragile young male with suicidal power fantasies who could up with $1000, or steal one from a relative who thought it was "protection". </p><p>And the Republicans in the nation's police followed him: an assault-weapons ban was no longer something that police chiefs and union leaders would say made good sense—if they were Republicans. Instead, it was every American's natural right to own one. And, they claimed, the police welcomed "good guys with guns" on the street.</p><p>And now all the Fox News-watching police nationwide, including those in Uvalde County, are absolutely terrified of what the Republican Party of Gingrich, Hastert, Boehner, Ryan, McCarthy, Dole, Lott, Frist, McConnell, W. Bush, McCain, Romney, and Trump have created. </p><p>And here we are.</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/delong/status/1530166664011972608>&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;<span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@asociologist</span> I found myself casting my memory back to the early days of the Clinton administration, when I was carrying spears for the Lloyd Bentsen Treasury.

And it has not done so. Not passing the early 2021 fiscal package, or having the federal reserve immediately respond by raising interest rates a year ago, would have slowed down the recovery: a serious loss. And it would have produced no gain: no societal well-being benefits that I can see.</p><p>And I have not even gotten to the asymmetric loss function point, which is also decisive: The Federal Reserve can deal with an overheated economy. It cannot deal with a frozen one:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Olivier Blanchard</strong>: <em>Economists Exchange</em>: ‘I didn’t anticipate the role of the goods market, which is that in many sectors the strong demand led to supply disruptions and very large increases in prices. In the end, inflation came first not from where I would have expected it to come, which was wages, but rather from prices…. I think that the increase in prices, the disruptions in supply chains, are very much the result of strong demand hitting supply walls. So, I would claim that I should get a few points for being right in February or March of 2021. Anybody could have come to the same conclusion. I’m happy I did…. What should the Fed have done or said when the fiscal package was passed? I hope that Jay Powell picked up his phone and told the administration that this was going to be an issue. His staff drank the Kool-Aid, and he, not being a professional economist, could not easily second-guess them. They thought inflation expectations would remain anchored and that the Phillips curve was flat…. The question is, indeed, how much of this is a blip. I use the word bump, which I think has a slightly longer length than a blip. But I believe we will then go back to low real interest rates. So, on this, I’m going to do the Larry Summers thing. I am going to say, with probability 0.9, we’ll return to something like that world. I think there’s a tendency for markets to focus on the current, on the present and extrapolate it forever.

Ideological zeal is behind… economic initiatives that form what Mr Xi calls his “new development concept”, which is meant to address “great changes unseen in a century”… to tackle inequality, monopolies and debt, and to ensure that China dominates new technologies and is fortified against Western sanctions. Yet in all cases Mr Xi believes the party must take the lead, and implementation has been punitive and erratic. A blizzard of fines, new regulations and purges…. A savage but incomplete crackdown on the property sector, responsible for over a fifth of gdp, has led to a funding crunch—one reason why housing sales fell by 47% in April compared with a year earlier…. Xi’s economic model… involves expanding the scope of the least productive part of the economy: the government-run one. China’s industrial policy has had formidable successes, for example building a dominant global position in advanced batteries. Mr Xi hopes that technology and a new cohort of state investment funds will make decision-making more agile. But don’t forget all the dismal failures, from rust-belt industries to microchips…. To the extent it can be discerned from the black box of elite politics, there is no rival to Mr Xi, who is 68.

Buildings are expensive and time-consuming to make and they also last a long time. Having a very sudden shift in what kinds of buildings people want (fewer offices and bigger houses) is a big pain economically because completely transforming the national building stock is hard…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:55315571,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.slowboring.com/p/remote-work-is-boosting-housing-demand&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:159185,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Slow Boring &quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec696af9-c7e4-4f1d-a582-6c0e5beffe69_768x768.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Remote work is boosting housing demand and driving inflation&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Housing costs have escalated dramatically over the past couple of years.

Malesky</strong>: <em>Enhancing the Literature on Authoritarian Regimes through Detailed Comparisons of China and Vietnam</em>: ‘In exploring the role of factions, personalism, and legislative behavior in the two states, the three contributions in this issue dispense with the simplistic notion of a China or Vietnam “Model” of political economy, but instead explain the politics behind how leaders are chosen and how legislative decisions are made and implemented. All three are explicitly comparative, documenting clear differences between the states and showing how these matter for explaining puzzles in critical political outcomes. As I argue in this essay, the insights of these three papers are important for more than just broadening area studies expertise, but for the burgeoning literature on authoritarian regimes, which has tended to black-box countries, insufficiently accounting for subtle institutional differences and variation in the policy preferences of elite actors. In this essay, I explore the unique contributions of each article to larger debates in comparative politics. I conclude by arguing for a unified theory that can help us better understand why these systems have been so successful in good times and resilient in hard times…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://sites.duke.edu/malesky/files/2020/11/20201104_ChinaVietnam_ejm3.pdf">https://sites.duke.edu/malesky/files/2020/11/20201104_ChinaVietnam_ejm3.pdf</a>&gt;</p></blockquote>
