Kwame Anthony Appiah: On Graeber & Wengrow: a€~The difficulty arises when what they present as a 
summary of the archaeology is at variance with the scholarship they cite. a€oeExperts have largely 
come to agree that therea€™ s no evidence fora€! anything like what we would recognize as a 
a€~statea€™ in the urban civilization of the Indus
Valley ,a€D they say. Then we turn to the source material and find that experts are quite divided 
on the topic. My point was not that The Dawn of Everything mischaracterizes Kenoyera€™ s judgments 
about Mohenjo-daroa€™ s political structure but that it doesna€™t characterize them at all. I was 
observing, that is, a pattern about which views get a
hearing. Wengrow says that a€oethe most recent scholarships□ supports Possehl, but the paper he has 
in minda€”a fascinating theoretical overview by Adam S. Green, which indeed stresses the evidence 
for egalitarianisma€’’gingerly dissents both from KenoyeraC™ s a€ce managerial elitea€D model and 
from Possehla€™ s a€oestateless
paradigm.a€D Greena€™ s paper, exquisitely provisional, makes clear that the nature of Indus 
politics is a topic of contention, not consensus.

Those archaeologists include the authorities The Dawn of Everything cites in support of Pasztory, 
such as RenA© Millon, who cataloged evidence of hierarchy and militarism in Teotihuacan, and 
thought its governance might have become oligarchical; and George Cowgill, who explicitly demurs 
from Pasztorya€™ s a€ceutopiana€D account and
proposes Renaissance Venice, a republic under a doge, as a model. The epigrapher David Stuart says 
that, in the late fourth and early fifth century, someone represented by an owlish glyph was the 
king of Teotihuacan, while other archaeologists conjecture that there might have been an elite 
assembly or aristocracy rather than a monarch; this glyph
might have designated an office rather than an officeholder. Recent discoveries have rekindled such 
debates. Again, Graeber and Wengrow are free to reach their own conclusion as to whether 
Teotihuacan was a€oea utopian experiment in urban life,a€D but it cannot be said to represent a 
professional consensus.

As for the a€oeat least seven centuries of collective self-rulea€n that Uruk enjoyed, per Graeber 
and Wengrow, is the proof really to be found in the wards and councils of the monarchical era? Or 
does the very coexistence of monarchs and councils suggest that we may be building castles, or 
communes, in the air? I dona€™ t say that Uruk did or
didna€™ t enjoy those seven centuries of a€oecollective self-rule,a€D but unless the term is being 
used in a very permissive way, I struggle to see how this possibility qualifies as a settled fact.

With respect to A$atalhAJyAUk, my discussion didna€™t take up The Dawn of Every thinga€™ 5 broad 
political characterization of the place. It took up what inferences we should draw from the 
existence of female figurines, and the putative absence of equivalent male ones. Did such 
representations demonstrate a€oea new awareness of
womena€™ s statusa€D? Graeber and Wengrow never use the term a€oegynocentrica€n with respect to 
A$atalhAJyAUk; they use, in this context, the term a€oematriarchala€n and devote a few helpful 
paragraphs to defining this term in a special way that sidesteps the a€ce-archy,a€D the connection 
with rulership. (I avoided the term
a€oematriarchala€n because, without their careful definition, it risks implying a form of rulership 
The Dawn of Everything disputes.) Graeber and Wengrow, following Hodder, find it obvious that the 
female figurines, with their pendulous breasts and avoirdupois, could have nothing to do with eros 
or fertility but are a€oequite possibly matriarchs of
some     sort, their forms revealing an interest in female elders .a€D Here, questions arise. One 
is whether wea€™d weigh the evidence differently had The Dawn of Everything mentioned that most 
A$atalhAJyAUk figurines that archaeologists have cataloged are of quadrupeds (or their horns).

Why does this matter? Because when it comes to a certain class of casesa€”prehistoric cities that 
they think lacked a ruling or managerial elitea€’’Graeber and Wengrow appear to cherish their 
thesis a little too much and, like overprotective parents, tend to keep it away from the chilly 
drafts of adverse evidence. Which brings us to those Ukrainian
mega-sites. In a 2017 article, John Chapman methodically challenges the view of them as 
a€oepermanent, long-term settlements comprising many thousands of people ,a€D a view he divides 
into a maximalist and a standard model. Drawing on evidence from his work in Nebelivka and 
calculations based on available evidence about the other sites, he
concludes that

the only logical response is to replace the standard model (not to mention the maximalist model) 
with a version of the minimalist model that envisions a less permanent, more seasonal settlement 
mode, or a smaller permanent settlement involving coeval dwelling of far fewer peoplea€!

the only logical response is to replace the standard model (not to mention the maximalist model) 
with a version of the minimalist model that envisions a less permanent, more seasonal settlement 
mode, or a smaller permanent settlement involving coeval dwelling of far fewer peoplea€!

Perhaps there was a small year-round population; perhaps these were sites where a€oehundreds of 
pilgrims or festival-goersa€D showed up in a seasonal way; perhaps both occurred.

In this account, what wea€™ d find on the mega-sites, even one as expansive as Taljanky, arena€™t 
citiesa€”that is, these settlements are remote from the dictionary definition of a city, from what 
we readers understand by the word, and, as best as I can judge, from what Graeber and Wengrow mean 
by it. They say most archaeologists will call
a€oeany densely inhabited settlementa€D of 150 or 200 hectares a city; yet one thing Chapman is 
confident about is that the a€oemega-sites were low-density settlements .a€D

Now, archaeologists sometimes use the word a€cecitya€D differently; the idea is that if a 
settlement, including one that looks like a hamlet, is the biggest thing around, it might function 
as a city. A hundred people living in face-to-face autarky, a seasonal festival site like Burning 
Man: even these could, in the right circumstances, count as cities. The
paper Wengrow cites, though it pointedly declines to define a€cecity,a€D sets aside absolute scale 
as a prerequisite. For Graeber and Wengrow, however, a central question is whether lots of people 
can live in a dense settlement without rules and rulers. Thata€™ s why they say cities often 
emerged as a€oecivic experiments on a grand scale.a€D In
their concept of a city, absolute scale cana€™ t be set aside.

Nor should we set aside the vigorous medieval arguments about the nature and origins of social 
inequality, as when The Dawn of Everything states that in the Middle Ages a€oea€~social equalitya€™ 
a€”and therefore, its opposite, inequality a€’’simply did not exist as a concept.a€D Many thought, 
as Pope Gregory did, that people, in their primordial,
Edenic state, were equal in their liberty. Then some act of human sinfulness left us with masters 
and serfs. For Gregory, Christa€™ s redemptive sacrifice was meant to bring back our original 
freedom. Such arguments had real-world reverberations. a€oeWhen Adam delved and Eve span/Who was 
then the gentleman?a€D was an English saying that
the priest John Ball declaimed amid the 1381 Peasantsa€™ Revolt, calling for a primordial classless 
society to be restored by force.

Wengrowa€™ s cautions about a€cepersonala€D politics are well taken; LA©vi-Straussa€™ s emerging 
conservatism is no key to his thought. By contrast, the political tenets Lewis Henry Morgan 
espoused within the book that entrenched social evolutionism were integral to his intellectual 
vision. Thorstein Veblena€™ s theory of predatory and
productive activities seamlessly connected his prehistory to his politics. And so it goes; we would 
do the great James C. Scott, whose studies have been invaluable to people from a range of 
ideological positions, a disservice to suppose that his political vision and his political science 
belonged in separate bins.

Yet this procession of caveats, I fear, risks obscuring The Dawn of Everythinga€™ s real triumphs. 
It is the work of two remarkable scholars, and almost every page is energized by their 
intelligence, imagination, and surly sense of mischief. When it comes to confident claims about 
dense large-scale settlements free of rulers or rules (or, for that matter,
the Haudenosaunee attitude toward commands), readers might well adopt Gertrude Steina€™ s mot 
a€oelnteresting if true.a€D But as I hope I made plain, therea€™ s much more to the book than that. 
Graeber and Wengrowa€™ s argument against historical determinisma€’’against the alluring notion 
that what happened had to have happeneda€”is
itself immensely valuable. Readers who imagine foragers on the Sahlinesque model of the San will 
encounter foraging societies with aristocrats and slavery, while the booka€™ s account of the 
Poverty Point earthworks is a riveting study of collective action. We get an intriguing proposal 
about the nature of the state. And this is just to begin a long list
of fascinations. That a€oekaleidoscope of social possibilitiesa€n emerges vibrantly from these 
pages.

If readers should be a little cautiousa€’’possibilities may not be probabilitiesa€”they should be 
much more than a little grateful, as I am. a€oeThis book is mainly about freedom,a€D Graeber and 
Wengrow tell us, but ita€™ s also for freedom. Ia€™m glad of that; oddly enough, freedom needs 
advocates these days, and few have been as eloquenta€!

If I am reading Kwame Anthony Appiah correctly here, he is sayinga€”very politely: a€oeThis is 
bullshit, but it is in the service of a good cause, for which we need much optimism of the 
willa€!a€D And this kind of annoys me, because what freedom needs is clear-eyed friends who dona€™ 
t become the victims of demagogues and grifters. So as a
result we need to closely observe whata€™ s what, rather than listen to pleasing 
misrepresentations.

I do wonder if there is anything Graeber and Wengrow have to say that is not a bastardized, 
inadequate, and confused version of Aristotle. Aristotle, as I understand him, says:

1. Monarchya€’’which allows for a degree of freedom in the context of a strongly hierarchical 
social order in which power is checked by law and customa€”is vulnerable to decay into tyranny, in 
which power becomes absolute, and freedom vanishes.

2. Tyranny is then vulnerable to revolution by its own grandees who fear lest they be the next ones 
purged, and so band together to create an aristocracya€’’which in its founding moment installs 
checks and balances to prevent the return of tyranny.

3. But aristocracya€’’which allows for a degree of freedom in the context of a less strongly 
hierarchical social order in which members of the elite compete for prestige and dominance and so 
check each othera€”is vulnerable to decay into oligarchy, in which the strong uneasily watch each 
other while they do what they want, while the weak
suffer what they must.

4. And oligarchy is then vulnerable to a democratic revolution, which removes the oligarchs from 
their high places and creates a largely non-hierarchical social order (among insiders) with 
considerable freedom.

5. But democracy is then vulnerable to decay into demagogy, as it develops leaders expert at 
telling the people what they want to hear, who then tyrannize in the name of the majority.

6. And at that point the situation is ripe for the establishment of a monarchya€”an honest master 
constrained by honor and, later, a constitution^”to replace the demagogic alternation of rule by 
the moba€™ s favorites-turned-masters.
But, says Aristotle, a proper mixed rA©gime can halt the wheel for a while, and produce order under 
law and individual freedom without the degree of hierarchy becoming oppressive. For a while.

As I understand it, the bulk of Graeber and Wengrowa€™ s examples of a€oeegalitarianisma€n are 
easily (and accurately) fitted into this Aristotelian schemaa€!
