Lerner</strong>: <em>‘Mearsheimer’s interventions reveal some larger problems for IR</em>… First and foremost is the issue of agency and responsibility…. If, as Mearsheimer’s theory predicts, the Russian invasion is due to its inevitable quest for regional hegemony in the balance of power, why blame anyone?…. Second… the <em>Politico</em>… describ[ing] weighty moral issues in the same gamified tone as fantasy baseball… portray[ing] the predictions of our theories as excuses for war crimes…. If the Russian Foreign Ministry is citing you favorably, you might want to have a good look in the mirror…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.duckofminerva.com/2022/03/a-tale-of-two-interviews-ir-theory-and-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine.html">https://www.duckofminerva.com/2022/03/a-tale-of-two-interviews-ir-theory-and-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>And another one:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Stephen Kotkin</strong>: <em>Don’t Blame the West for Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine</em>: ‘Way before NATO existed in the 19th century, Russia looked like this. It had an autocrat, it had repression, it had militarism. It had suspicion of foreigners and the West. This is a Russia we know, and it’s not a Russia that arrived yesterday or arrived in the 1990s. It’s not a response to actions of the West. There are internal processes in Russia that account for where we are today…. NATO expansion has put us in a better place to deal with this historical pattern in Russia that we’re seeing again…. Russia is a great power, but not <em><strong>the</strong></em> great power…. In trying to… manage the differential between Russia and the West, they resort to coercion, a very heavy state-centric approach…. That works for a time, ostensibly…. And then, of course, it hits a wall…. The worst part of this dynamic in Russian history is the conflation of the Russian state with some personal ruler…. They get a dictatorship, which usually becomes a despotism. So Putin is what he is… ruling in Russia…. Russia cannot successfully occupy Ukraine…. They don’t even have a quisling yet…</p></blockquote><p>Russia today has a population of 150 million people.&nbsp;Of those some 120 million are "Russians" and 30 million are classified as ethnic minorities. Russia’s GDP is in the range of Japan, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, Britain, and France—20% above France, 30% below Japan. In a world in which nato exists to make real into implement, for Europe at least, the dreams of ending war and military coercion set out at the San Francisco founding of the United Nations, Russia’s ability to bully other countries via its military is very small. It can wreck things, but “making a desert and calling it ‘peace’” is on longer a rational strategy.</p><p>Military conquest seems unlikely to be durable in this day and age, unless accompanied by nigh-complete ethnic cleansing and demographic replacement. But was it ever? In 1721 King Frederick I Vasa of Sweden surrendered Swedish Ingria, Estonia, Livonia, Kexholmslän, and Karelia to Tsar Peter the Great. But Peter accepted that his conquest was limited: the Germanic-speaking Baltic nobility retained “their financial system, their existing customs border, their self-government, their Lutheran religion, and the German language”. Starting in 1860 the Tsarist Empire attempted to erode these privileges and “Russify”. But as of today of all these conquests of the Great Northern War of the early 1700s, only Peter’s conquest of Swedish Ingria—where St. Petersburg now stands—has stuck.</p><p>Indeed, in this day and age, military adventures appear more likely to make durable enemies rather than win subjects and influence. It will be very difficult to get Ukrainians to think of themselves as in any sense Muscovites after this.</p><p>Thus if Russia wants to be a great power rather than a contained menace, it must rely on its soft power. Hence a Russia that wants to have influence over the course of the world in the future and lead the people of Ross and the other Slavic peoples and their neighbors into the future will have to rely on its soft power: its role as a provider of natural resources, and both the wealth and the possibly weaponized interdependence that come with resources; plus its cultural power. A Russia that wants to be an influential Russia should be building not tanks but touring companies of the Bolshoi Ballet, and binding the world economy to its resource base.</p><p>The problem is—the problems are—(a) that Putin is not rational, (b) that Russia’s autocratic domestic politics have long leaked into its foreign-policy adventurism and right now is doing it again in a way that seems strongly counterproductive, and (c) the very unrealistic “Realist” assumption that only the United States has agency, and as the only actor with agency bears complete responsibility for whatever bad things happen, would cloud our thought on all this, if we let it.</p><p>Perhaps the most strange and bizarre thing about Mearsheimer is that the theory he draws on implies that states seeking regional hegemony are never satisfied with any borders, and continue adventuring in a pointless quest for more security until they run up against a force to contain them. “Realism” in its tragic model recognizes that spheres-of-influence borders are always and inherently potentially bloody. Thus the only question for a consistent Mearsheimer is whether Muscovy will bloody Donbas, Moldava, the Hungarian Plain, the Fulda Gap, or the Rhine. But the drive to blame America first overrides consistency.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/international-relations-has-a-bad?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/international-relations-has-a-bad?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Image:</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b15a19f-e2dc-4c26-ada4-1a92f590f1bb_1010x776.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b15a19f-e2dc-4c26-ada4-1a92f590f1bb_1010x776.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b15a19f-e2dc-4c26-ada4-1a92f590f1bb_1010x776.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b15a19f-e2dc-4c26-ada4-1a92f590f1bb_1010x776.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b15a19f-e2dc-4c26-ada4-1a92f590f1bb_1010x776.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b15a19f-e2dc-4c26-ada4-1a92f590f1bb_1010x776.png" width="1010" height="776" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b15a19f-e2dc-4c26-ada4-1a92f590f1bb_1010x776.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:776,&quot;width&quot;:1010,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:989203,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b15a19f-e2dc-4c26-ada4-1a92f590f1bb_1010x776.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b15a19f-e2dc-4c26-ada4-1a92f590f1bb_1010x776.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b15a19f-e2dc-4c26-ada4-1a92f590f1bb_1010x776.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b15a19f-e2dc-4c26-ada4-1a92f590f1bb_1010x776.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Kings &amp;

Matthew Yglesias says that Jesse Jackson was right on the merits back in 1988. Matthew Yglesias says that Jesse Jackson is right on the merits today. But he says the DLC was right on the <em><strong>strategy</strong></em> in 1988—cater to the electorate as it exists, and create a big-tent party rather than one "whose brand is dominated by leftist intellectuals”. But creating a big-tent party is what elected Democratic office-holders (and those who hope to get elected in competitive seats) do. And it is what Democratic-oriented policy intellectuals in the policy entrepreneurs do. “Leftist intellectuals” shitpost on Twitter and rant in podcasts and in little magazines. And Republicans say: “you must elect us or these people will make your life hell.” And reporters for the <em>Washington Post</em> and the <em>New York Times</em> and CNN pretend to take seriously Republican claims that Democratic office-holders are beholden to Twitter shitposters. Matt urges Democratic office-holders to talk about Democratic policy proposals that are popular. But they already do that. So shouldn’t Matt be urging shitposters to talk about Democratic policy proposals that are popular? And it is not clear how that is advanced by saying “the DLC was right even though it was wrong”. I will try to resolve this puzzlement:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Matthew Yglesias</strong>: <em>What the DLC Got Wrong</em>: ‘The DLC hated Jesse Jackson, but I think his speech at the 1988 Democratic National Convention is great: “It does not make sense to be escorting all our tankers up and down the Persian Gulf paying $2.50 for every $1 worth of oil we bring out, while oil wells are capped in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. I just want to make sense. Leadership must meet the moral challenge of its day. What’s the moral challenge of our day? We have public accommodations. We have the right to vote. We have open housing. What’s the fundamental challenge of our day? It is to end economic violence. Plant closings without notice—economic violence. Even the greedy do not profit long from greed—economic violence. Most poor people are not lazy. They are not black. They are not brown. They are mostly White and female and young. But whether White, Black or Brown, a hungry baby’s belly turned inside out is the same color—color it pain, color it hurt, color it agony. Most poor people are not on welfare. Some of them are illiterate and can’t read the want-ad sections. And when they can, they can’t find a job that matches the address. They work hard everyday. I know, I live amongst them. They catch the early bus. They work every day. They raise other people’s children. They work everyday. They clean the streets. They work everyday. They drive dangerous cabs. They change the beds you slept in in these hotels last night and can’t get a union contract. They work everyday. No, no, they’re not lazy. Someone must defend them because it’s right and they cannot speak for themselves. They work in hospitals. I know they do. They wipe the bodies of those who are sick with fever and pain. They empty their bedpans. They clean out their commodes. No job is beneath them, and yet when they get sick they cannot lie in the bed they made up every day. America, that is not right! We are a better Nation than that!” This is the idea that I have referred to in the past as the “wisdom of the ancients,” reflecting how Martin Luther King, Bayard Rustin, and other Civil Rights Movement leaders thought about the questions facing America after the successes of the early 1960s. It involves exhorting people to find unity in common economic uplift rather than emphasizing elite-level diversity or the need to center the racial angle in every controversy. Was this Jackson message too left-wing for 1988? Maybe. Was America just too racist to vote for a Black person no matter what he said? Very plausibly. Public opinion was way more conservative in the 1990s, and to an extent, we maybe couldn’t have done much better than Bill Clinton. But we know Americans in Iowa and Ohio and Florida were ready to vote twice for Barack Obama based on a message of unity. And while I think his administration had serious failings, I think these were mostly failures of technical policy analysis (especially about the deficit/stimulus balance) rather than basic political judgment. And I think what Democrats need today is more TAP in 2002 than TNR in 2002, more William Julius Wilson than Will Marshall. But the big DLC meta-analytic points about the need to cater to the existing electorate and create a big tent party rather than one whose brand is dominated by leftist intellectuals are completely correct…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:53302113,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.slowboring.com/p/what-the-dlc-got-wrong&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:159185,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Slow Boring &quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec696af9-c7e4-4f1d-a582-6c0e5beffe69_768x768.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;What the DLC got wrong &quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Someone recently asked me how my current approach to politics and Democratic Party factional infighting aligns with the approach associated with the Democratic Leadership Council from a generation ago.

The problem with this of course is the “risk premia” in asset markets not really risk premia, in the sense of being compensation for the extra uncertainty in future consumption and hence lowered expected utility delivered by the combination of uncertainty and the declining marginal utility of wealth. Thus how population aging and hence shorter horizons would alter risk premia if people were in fact insanely risk-averse because of an insanely rapidly declining marginal utility of wealth… It is a gesture toward a “crowded trade” explanation of the phenomena, but only a gesture:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Joseph Kopecky &amp; Alan M. Taylor</strong>: <em>The Savings Glut of the Old: Population Aging, the Risk Premium, and the Murder-Suicide of the Rentier</em>: ‘Population aging has been linked to a global savings glut and a decline in safe real interest rates…. We go further to account for divergent returns on different assets as well as the underlying surge in the wealth-income ratio and its asset composition…. Demographic shifts are correlated with asset returns and risk premia…. A heterogeneous agent life-cycle model with two assets (a safe bond and equity) and with aggregate risk [and] aging demographics… the rising wealth-income ratio, the falling risk free rate, and an increasing risk premium…. Aging makes retirement saving a “crowded trade” but more so for bonds. Projecting our model to 2050, aging pushes the safe rate below zero, but the risk premium remains elevated, as post-boomer demographics push asset returns to unprecedented and persistently low levels…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29944">https://www.nber.org/papers/w29944</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Increasing the scope of human connection and contact through figuring out how to use remote technologies effectively should be very very good. I know that I at least am looking forward to a quantum jump in the effectiveness of my office hours even after the plague recedes. Phone calls were never a good substitute for office hours. Video calls will be—and it will be a lot easier to get people to show up for video calls then to get them to Trump up to the sixth floor of Evans, or even over to the coffee shop. The potential downside is, as always, the possible loss of external benefits from close proximity in meatspace. And we should think very hard about how to avoid that a loss of positive externalities. And if we do so I think then we can be very hopeful:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Noah Smith</strong>: <em>Think Bigger About Remote Work</em>: ‘Let me throw out a few things that I think are being totally underestimated by pessimists who would rather focus on direct effects and adjustment costs…. You can now create brand new places, far from existing labor markets, and lure in skilled remote workers with nice amenities…. My hope is that the next decade will lead property developers, planners, and investors to create brand new remote-worker villages and new places aimed at remote workers in locations previously untenable, all with amenities and forms that are as new and exciting as the changes past transportation innovations have ushered in…. Remote-work patents have surged and new innovations in how we work together remotely are clearly underway. What this heralds remains to be seen, maybe virtual or augmented reality, maybe it just becomes easier to cross-talk on Zoom. Either way, however well remote work is going now, it is only going to get better…. New business formation has surged post-pandemic…. Like almost all technologies, remote work will surely include significant adjustment costs and winners and losers…. What we should not do is succumb to a myopic pessimism that focuses on the direct costs and not on the wider benefits and potential…. The question whether society gets the full benefits of remote work in significant part comes down to whether policymakers stand in the way of the possibilities that are opening up…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:53002259,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/think-bigger-about-remote-work&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:35345,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Noahpinion&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/04281755-2cd6-42e5-a496-e69153abebb2_281x281.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Think Bigger About Remote Work&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;I’ve written — and I still believe — that the rise of remote work triggered by the Covid pandemic will end up changing the way we produce things in the modern world.

Second, the big money in it comes from out-and-out grifts, and from building the infrastructure to support large-scale crime. And, third, the medium money in it comes from degrading the quality of the trusted, decentralized, community-owned database part. The government could do Web3 in an effective way. Apple could do it for the Apple ecosystem. Google could do it were Google to be not evil. But Silicon Valley as a decentralized institution cannot:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Nilay Patel</strong>: <em>Chris Dixon Thinks Web3 Is the Future of the Internet—Is It?</em>: ‘Web1… 1990 to 2005…. The platform that you built on was the web or on email… open protocols designed by the government and academia… became the governing protocols of the early internet… a very positive thing…. Web2… 2005 to 2020… social networking…. A big negative thing with Web2: We basically handed over the power of the effective de facto control of the internet to five or so companies. Open protocols still exist, you can still go to websites, but effectively most of the power and most of the money on the web goes to Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, and maybe Twitter and a handful of other[s]…. If Web3 works right… it is the best of both worlds of Web1 and Web2… advanced functionality… from Web2… the predictability, reliability, and neutrality of Web1 protocols… creative people, businesses, and startups… reach audiences directly, and to truly have a relationship with those audiences that is not mediated by algorithms and advertising… which is where I think we are today…. A lot of why Twitter won is that, opposed to RSS, they had a global namespace. The problem with RSS and with Mastodon is the internet right now has no publicly owned, common database; there is no place to store that follow graph. That is why companies stepped in and said, “We’ll store it for you.” Then once they stored it, they ended up having monopolistic network effects.
