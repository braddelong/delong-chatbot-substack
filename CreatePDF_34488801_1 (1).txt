Paragraphs:

And I am quoted by the extremely smart and hard-working Greg Sargent:

Greg Sargent: Kristi Noema€™ s Hannity interview Shows How the Coming Infrastructure War Will 
Exacerbate Division: a€~Kristi Noem, the
Republican governor of South Dakota, triggered epic mockery when she offered a creative argument 
against President Bidena€™ s new infrastructure plan
on   Fox News on Wednesday night. a€oel was shocked by how much doesna€™ t go into 
infrastructure,a€D Noem said. a€oelt goes into research and
development, it goes into housing and pipes and different initiatives, green energy, and ita€™ s 
not really an honest conversation wea€™re having about
what   this proposal is.a€D Of course, pipes are infrastructure^! drink[ing] lead-tainted water. It 
would spend enormously on the most conventional
infrastructure projects, such as bridge and road repair ($115 billion), ports and airports ($42 
billion) and public transit, Amtrak and freight rail ($165
billion).

Buta€! thea€! distinction Noem drewa€! between a€oeinfrastructurea€n on one hand, and a€oeresearch 
and developments□ and Soegreen
energya€Da€!. Republicans and Democrats, it turns out, have deep differences over what constitutes 
a€ceinfrastructure.a€Da€! Republican lawmakers
have increasingly equated infrastructure with new highways that connect rural communities and 
promote exurban sprawla€!. But they see most of what
Biden proposed as SoeDemocratic infrastructurea€Da€!.

[But] back during the Eisenhower era, Republicans widely supported large public investments in big 
projects such as the interstate highway system. But
they also supported big investments in research and development, in the technologies of the future 
and in education for the express purpose of facilitating
future national development. a€oe After the launch of Sputnik, for the federal government to spend 
whatever it took to produce universities and scientists
and high technology became priority No. 1 of the Republican Partya€!a€D economist Brad Delong told 
me. a€oeEducation and engineering in high
technology became the key piece of lacking American infrastructure that the Eisenhower 
administration wanted to create,a€D continued DeLong, the co­
author                                                                     of a book about 
governments™ s role in reshaping the economy at key historical moments. Republicans at the time 
viewed this as a€oeessential to
America achieving its national purposes,a€D DeLong saida€!

The book, written with Stephen S. Cohen, is Concrete Economics: The Hamilton Approach to Economic 
Policy

<https://www.google.com/books/edition/Concrete Economics/BXoyBgAAQBAJ>. It was a plea for 
pragmatism rather than ideology in political economya€”and a sotto voce word

of advice to Republicans to return their party to what it was before Goldwater cursed them and 
enslaved them to the demons of racism. Back then they thought the point was to
make the American economy stronger, more dynamic, and more rapidly changing, because we are a 
frontier people and todaya€™ s frontiers are technological. And, yes, there
would be some big winners, but (a) that was a positive point and (b) in the long run nearly 
everyone would be a winner. Now the Republican Party has become a party of plutocrats
and white racists who greatly fear change and dynamism, because for the plutocratsa€’’especially 
the heirs and heiressesa€’’growth, dynamism, and change are their enemies
because it is their wealth that dynamic Schumpeterian capitalism creatively destroys, and because 
for the racists growth, dynamism, and change brings the possibility that people
who  look different will not bow heads but instead will look them in the eye.

Joshua Gans agrees with me: much better for people with things to say to be on SubStack rather than 
working as sideshow acts for advertisers. SubStack and company look, to me,
like a substantial intellectual win. But will the Gods of the Marketplace be tolerant enough for it 
to be self-sustainable?:

Joshua Gans: a€™ I have noticed that the journalists/opinion writers who have migrated to Substack 
are writing better pieces than they have in years.
They are up in terms of length, reading age-level and complexity of arguments. I think this is a 
consequence of the change in underlying business model.
When you sell ads, you need views. That means you want a product that attracts the marginal 
customer. When you sell subscriptions, that may seem to also
hold but it doesna€™ t. Thata€™ s because a subscription is not a payment for an individual unit 
but instead a payment for a bundle. To keep people
subscribed to the bundle, people have to be attracted to the average rather than the marginal 
attracting people. That, combined with the lack of an
intermediary, means that the scale of a substack is much lower and more niche than ad-based 
outlets. Hence, for people I consumed even when they were
edited/commercialised, I am happier now when thev are not. For others, I cana€™ t tell (vet)a€!

Steve M. thinks that the a€oepipes arena€™ t really infrastructurea€n line of attack will be 
unsuccessful, because stupid. But the question is whether or not it is too stupid for the
Lester Holts and the Chuck Todds and the other media gatekeepers who have had their moral sense 
excised by surgical operation will find it too stupid to amplify with their
megaphones. The jury is still out on that;

Steve M.: New Right-Wing Talking Point: Evil Libs Want You to Think Buildings Are Infrastructure!'. 
a€~Leta€™ s not mock Governor Noem for thisa€”
ita€™ s not just her talking point. Ita€™ s clearly the focus-grouped right-wing talking point on 
the billa€! Sean Hannitya€! Newsmaxa€! Trending
Politicsa€! enumerates itemsa€! it says aren't infrastructure-related, among which is 'a€oe$8O 
billiona€!Amtraka€! $213 billion to produce, preserve, and
retrofit more than two million affordable and sustainable places to live (and we know who will and 
who wona€™ t a€~qualifya€™ for these homes,
dona€™  t we?)a€D That's saying the quiet part out loud, with a bullhorna€!.

Breitbart just throws up its hands, calls the legislation a€oeJoe Bidena€™ s $2.5 Trillion 
a€~Infrastructurea€™ Bill,a€D with a€oeinfrastructurea€n in
scare quotes, then lists a€oesome of the top 45 spending proposals,a€D including: $111 billion to 
replace 100 percent of the nationa€™ s lead pipes and
service lines, $100 billion to upgrade and build new public schools, $100 billion to build 
high-speed broadband infrastructure to reach 100 percent
coverage,                                                                     $100 billion to build 
a more resilient electric transmission system, $85 billion to modernize existing transit and help 
agencies expand their
systems to meet rider demand, $80 billion to address Amtraka€™ s repair backlog; modernize the high 
traffic Northeast Corridor; improve existing
corridors and connect new city pairsa€”all of which seem to me like infrastructure, rather than 
a€ceinfrastructurea€D in scare quotes, but experts disagree,
I guess.

So yes, this is their argument: School buildings and rail lines and power lines and water pipes 
arena€™ t infrastructure. Ia€™ m shockeda€”the right is
usually much better at thisa€!

First is Rescue, second is Rebuild, and I do not know what the third part of Bidena€™ s 100-Days 
initiative package is going to calleda€’’Rebalancing, perhaps? But Bloomberg is
getting ready. And I am warning everybody that rebalancing the wealth distribution to any 
significant degree will be very hard, and take a very long time:

Christopher Condon & Payne Lubbers: Biden Seeks to Reverse Decades of Disparity in Next Economy 
Move'. a€~More than a half century after Lyndon
Johnsona€™ s war on poverty, President Joe Biden is planning to take on the nationa€™ s enduring 
challenge of inequality with a mass expansion of
government spending and a revamp of the tax codea€!. The presidents™ s remarks will lay out the 
infrastructure portion of an overall package expected

to total more than $3 trillions!. Heather BousheyS! SoeThe ultimate measure of success of the 
economy is how well itS™ s working for people all
across these United States.SD For many, itS™ s not working well. The gaps between the richest 
Americans and the middle class, along with the lowest-
income households, widened in the years before the pandemic struckS’’even amid the longest U.S. 
expansion on records!.

Halting or reversing the trend even with major changes in policy wonS™t come easily or quickly, 
economists widely agree. a€oeYoua€™re turning a
supertanker, and ita€™ s taken us a generation and half to get here,a€D said Brad Delong, an 
economics professor at the University of California at
Berkeley. a€oeBut, yes, you can start to turn the supertankera€Da€!

This is just dorky on behalf of the Bloomberg News Editorial Board. The whole point of BREXITa€”to 
the extent that it has a pointa€”was so that Boris Johnson could chart his
own course, which of course includes unduly loosening regulations in a bid to attract business. The 
Bloomberg Editorial Board here blames the EU for an action by the UK. The EU
did not leave the UK. The UK left the EU. What the BNEB blames the EU for not accomplishinga€”the 
constructive revocation of BREXITa€”has to start with a guarantee from
the UK that it will shadow EU regulations, not a guarantee from the EU that it will maintain access 
permanently:

Bloomberg News Editorial Board: Europe Will Regret Stealing Londona€™ s Finance Business After 
Brexit: a€~In quitting the European Union, the

U.K. has handed its former partners a golden opportunity: Seize some of the lucrative financial 
services business that London has long dominated. ItS™ s
a temptation that European officials would do well to resists!. The solution isnS™ t difficult. The 
EU and the U.K. should grant each otherS™ s firms
full access as long as their regulatory regimes remain roughly equivalents!. Such agreements should 
be made permanent, broadenedS! and strengthened
to ensure the EU wonS™ t revoke access suddenly and unilaterally. In return, the U.K. should offer 
assurances that it wonS™ t unduly loosen regulations
in a bid to attract business. The goal, in short, should be to keep trade as free as it was when 
the U.K. was still in the EUS!

As Bill Janeway likes to say, when you give a banker near-infinite credit, you know exactly what he 
is going to do. You just do not know at which wall he will do it. Much better to
have a fiscal policy and a wealth distribution with which full employment does not require that the 
central bank keep interest rates low low low low for long long long long. And
much better to reconfigure banks, so as to make everybody a risk manager for everybody else within 
six desks of themselves:

Methinks John Scalzi has shipped his latest book to the editor, and now has time to be wise:

John Scalzi: Does Money Satisfy?: a€~Money doesna€™ t satisfy, it alleviates. In drug terms, 
moneya€™ s not a mood-lifter, ita€™ s a painkillera€!. There is a definite short-term
bump that comes from suddenly having in your possession a larger sum of moneya€!. Buta€! that 
euphoria is both short-lived (the hedonic treadmill of money moves quickly), and
usually masking a wider and more complex emotional responsea€!. After the happy shock wears off, 
what they feel is often something like relief. That money can go to solve
problemsa€!. This is what I mean by money being a painkiller. So many of so many peoplea€™ s 
day-to-day problems are caused by the lack of money. Lack of money causes
uncertainty, anxiety and worrya€’’causes pain. When you have money that pain goes awaya€!. When you 
dona€™ t have pain, you dona€™ t think about that pain, and you
dona€™     t think of all the things you have to do to manage that pain. You justa€! get to do and 
think about other thingsa€! LINK: <https://whatever.scalzi.com/2021/04/01/reader-
