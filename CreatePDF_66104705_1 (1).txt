• Rajiv Sethi: On Summers, Manchin, & the Value of Dissent: a€~Disagreement has social value, 
demonization does not. Sometimes public positions are simply disguised statements of private 
interest, and sometimes they are just good faith arguments. Summers was able to speak his mind and 
stick to his guns, but few people have his power, prestige, and public platform. More generally, 
vilification stifles debate and promotes self-censorship,
undermining the very interests it seeks to servea€!

Imperfect Information

On Summers, Manchin, and the Value of Dissent

Many people were taken by surprise yesterday when Senator Joe Manchin announced his support for an 
ambitious legislative package that addresses climate change, clean energy production, prescription 
drug prices, and health insurance costs: Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a key centrist 
Democrat, announced on Wednesday that he had agreed to inclua€!

Five things worth reading on CHIPS and IRA:

Greg Sargent: The Huge, Hidden Bonanza in Getting Joe Manchin to Yes: a€~If the West Virginia 
Democrat and his party get this done, it will probably be with zero Republicansa€’’while expanding 
the boundaries of whata€™ s achievable by that Democratic coalition. The deal would raise $739 
billion by rolling back tax benefits enjoyed by corporations and the wealthy. It would pump $369 
billion into incentivizing green energy,
extend health-care subsidies for millions and empower government to negotiate down prescription 
drug pricesa€!. On climate, Manchin says he backs investment in the technologies of a greener 
future, but without an abrupt abandonment of fossil fuelsa€!. Yeta€! this would be our biggest 
investment in our climate future evera€! could reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent from 2005 
levels by 2030. Manchin represents the very outer
reaches of the Democratic coalitiona€!. If Manchin can sell this package on his own chosen terms in 
West Virginia, that hints at new possibilities for Democratsa€!. Republicans will likely sit all 
this out entirelya€!. Both parties are shifting toward embracing industrial policy. But only one is 
serious about our need for a far-reaching clean-energy transition and a full overhaul of a 
regressive tax systema€!

Klon Kitchen: The CHIPS Act: Far From Perfect, but Still Very Good: a€~The U.S. Senate has passed a 
$250 billion plan to boost American semiconductor manufacturing^!. Ia€™ ve come to believe the 
Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act meaningfully advances U.S. 
interestsa€!. $52.7 billion in grants to support domestic semiconductor research, manufacturing, 
and productiona€” including $2
billion for chipsets that are essential to the U.S. auto and defense industries; $24 billion in 
estimated tax credits for investments into U.S. semiconductor manufacturing; and, $200 billion for 
chip-related scientific researcha€!. Congressa€! has been debating a series of a€oeguardrailsa€~a€™ 
that would allow this support to energize the American chip industry without also boosting the 
capacity of our chief geopolitical rival. These
guardrails are a key point of contentiona€!. The CHIPS Act is something conservatives can, and do, 
disagree ona€”and thata€™ s okay. Whata€™ s not okay, however, is not taking decisive action to 
constrain Chinese and to bolster American advanced chip manufacturing. I think this legislation 
meaningfully does both and thata€™ s why it has my supporta€!

The best reason for Republicans to cut deals is that doing so can produce policy gains for them

Emily Cochrane, Jim Tankersley & Lisa Friedman: Manchin, in Reversal, Agrees to Quick Action on 
Climate & Tax Plan: a€~$369 billion for climate and energy proposals, the most ambitious climate 
action ever taken by Congress, and raise an estimated $451 billion in new tax revenue over a 
decade, while cutting federal spending on prescription drugs by $288 billiona€!. The plan falls far 
short of the ambitious domestic policy and
tax package President Biden proposed last yeara€!. The abrupt announcement came only hours after 
passage of a huge industrial policy bill aimed at bolstering American competitiveness with China 
that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, had said he would 
never support as long as Democrats continued their efforts to push through their marquee domestic 
policy bill over G.O.P. opposition^!.

means-tested $7,500 tax credit to make new electric vehicles more
affordable, and a $4,000 tax credit for used electric vehicles, according to a summary of the 
package. Both credits will be offered only to lower and middle-income consumers. The measure also 
includes a methane fee that will start in 2025. Also included will be $60 billion to address the 
disproportionate burden of pollution on low-income communities and communities of color, $27

The Democrats coupled the spending with provisions that aim to lower health-care costs for 
Americans, chiefly by allowing Medicare

In the authoritarian social-media Schmittian politics of friends-and-enemies, saying that I follow 
Trumpa€™ s policies but have broken with Trump-the-fool is not going to cut it with the Republican 
base for Mike Pence:

Steve M.: Mike Pence to Republican Voters: Ia€™m Really a Trumper, Just Like You!: a€™ Mike 
Pencea€™ s memoira€! the oddest sentence in the publishera€™ s announcement: a€oeThe most robust 
defense of the Trump record of anyone who served in the administration, SO HELP ME GOD also 
chronicles President Trumpa€™ s severing of their relationship on January 6,2021 when Pence kept 
his oath to the Constitution.a€D
We know that Pence is delusional: He thinks he can win the votes of Trump supporters, even though 
they regard him as a traitor and a RINO. But now we know the specifics of his pitcha€!. Pence wants 
2024 GOP primary voters to think: The state of the Union in the Trump years was very good, and the 
man who was a heartbeat away from the presidency surely deserves a large share of the credit for 
thata€”and also hea€™ s a man of
character and an admirer of the Constitution, unlike the former president. So leta€™ s get the good 
stuffa€”the recorda€’’without Trump and his awful character flaws. Pence a€™ 24! But Trump fansa€! 
think America and the world were better in the Trump years because Trump was tough, smart, and 
crafty, a bully and a rule breaker. Ia€™m sure they cana€™t explain how that helped him bring about 
paradise on earth. He just did it
with Trumpness. To the fans, the outward manifestation of Trumpness is that you say and do things 
that infuriate your enemies, and you get away with a lot of them. Ron DeSantis has Trumpness. Mike 
Pence doesna€™ t. But Pence doesnaC™ t grasp any of thisa€!. DeSantis will win the nomination if 
Trump doesna€™ t, while Pence will be lucky to win a dozen delegatesa€!

Is liberalism as we have known it a consequence of print-culture that is unlikely to survive its 
end?

Kevin Munger: Why I Am (Still) a Liberal (For Now): a€~The platform web has cannibalized 
liberal/literate culture overnight. Twitter is a a€oedeliberation-themed video gamea€D that has 
deformed real, vibrant humans into bitter cyborgs competing to dehumanize and degrade. Twitter 
culture is Cruelty Culture. This epicenter of intellectual/cultural/political activity is proudly 
incompatible with liberalism. The a€oethick
liberalisma€D of the past centuries has been rendered obsolete by new media technologies. The 
groups who can harness the internet for their own ends will decide what comes next. But I am 
(still) a liberal (for now) in the a€cethina€D sense, the sense in which avoiding human cruelty and 
humiliation should be a central political goal. Twitter Cruelty Culture is what illiberal 
intellectual ironism looks like. And it is an abominationa€!.
[Richard] Rorty is a self-avowed liberal, with two related conceptions of liberal: someone who 
believes cruelty is the worst thing that can happen to a human being (what Ia€™m calling 
a€cethina€D), and someone who believes that values of political liberalism (freedom of speech, 
representative democracy, toleration) are the best way to achieve a reduction in human cruelty and 
suffering (a€oethicka€D). The problem for Rorty, as for
so  many of the thinkers from the Gutenberg Parenthesis, is that they are unavoidably embedded in 
the culture made possible by the technology of writing. That is: he needs more McLuhan. Freedom of 
speech, representative democracy toleration: these are all products of a literate culture, 
designed/discovered to take advantage of writinga€™ s strengths and ameliorate its weaknessesa€!. 
Defending thin liberalisma€’’ceasing to valorize
crueltya€”wona€™ t solve the problem of what comes next. But it will help us preserve some dignity 
and humanity in this inhuman timea€!

The American Legislature Creaking Into Motion

DRAFT of a Project Syndicate Column

In the United States Congress, nothing is ever over until it is finally over, but as of the end of 
July, it looks as though the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act and 
thea€”but it is not and we should not call it Build Back Bettera€”call it Make Again Higher Act 
will actually arrive on President Biden's desk for signature late this summer. That will shift 
Biden's first two years from "disappointing", as far as legislative accomplishments are
concerned, to "exceeds expectations "a€”if not "fulfills wild hopes and dreams".

The early American Rescue Plan cemented a strong recovery that ensured we would not have a repeat 
of the long, grinding semi-depression of Obama's years; its contribution to our COVID- and 
Russia-generated inflation problem was small, and our inflation problem is a much smaller headache 
than another mostly-lost growth decade would have been. $50 billion in semiconductor manufacturing 
credits, $200  billion forsemiconductor scientific research, $370
billion in climate and energy, $300 billion in drug-price savings, and $450 billion in tax rates 
and tax enforcementa€”all of these are very good things for America to do.

America will produce some $325 trillion of goods and services over the next decade. Thus, in 
context, we are only committing 0.7%-points of our next-decade's productive resources to additional 
semiconductor-related investments, only raising tax rates and tax enforcement by 1.3%-points, only 
saving 0.9%-points worth in drug costs, only boosting the resources we are devoting to fighting 
global warming and itsconsequences by1.1%-points of our next
decade's productive resources. Thus the big complaint against what will roll forward under the 
acronyms of CHIPS and IRA will be that out is only a drop in the bucket: a small redirection of 
what we do in a constructive direction, only one-tenth the scale of the investments and commitments 
that a rational government faced with America's and the world's current problems would undertake.

But one should do what one can. The story about French Marshal Lyautey, told by his gardeners that 
he would never live to see the trees grow that he had wanted planted tomorrow comes to mind: a€oeln 
that casea€D, the aged retired soldier said, a€oeplant them this afternoona€n.

All of the pieces seem to me to be no-brainers. The semiconductor industry will be much healthier 
if it is pushed further away from monopoly and tight oligopoly by preserving and expanding the 
United States as an advanced manufacturing site, and thus also preserving the United States's 
viability as not just a basic science but as a research and development site. Slimming-down the 
rents the pharmaceutical companies have won through their lobbying past
congresses is long overdue. There is no argument against increases in tax progressiveness to offset 
a small part of the increase in income inequality and the increased tax regressiveness of the past 
generations. And as for global warming and the energy transitiona€”we are now three decades late in 
taking steps that we ought to have taken, and that Al Gore's foresight and pressure got us within 
one senate vote of taking, back in 1993.

a€oeWhy cana€™ t America make good decisions, make good policies anymore?a€D That was what one of 
my foreign-born friends asked me over coffee in the Berkeley, CA afternoon sunshine a couple of 
weeks ago. Well, if CHIPS and IRA pass, it will be a sign that perhaps we can. Perhaps the 
political fever by which politics has become an extremist game of a€oeown your enemiesa€D is 
breaking.

Or perhaps not. The Republican House leadership has just announced that it is not only opposed to 
CHIPS, but is going to actively whip against it, and try to keep it from getting any Republican 
votes in the House. Why? It is not because they have decided that CHIPS is bad policy. It is 
because Senators Schumer and Manchin are advancing the IRA through the Senate. And it is not even 
that they claim to think that IRA is a bad idea because global warming is a
hoaxa€”at least not any morea€”and because Medicare currently pays fair prices for pharmaceuticals.

It is, rather, that passing CHIPS and IRA would give Joe Biden one accomplishment too many.
