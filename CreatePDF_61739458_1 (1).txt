Book forthcoming September 6!: <bit.ly/3pP3Krk>. This was very, very nice to see:

Paul Krugman: Technology & the Triumph of Pessimism: a€~a€oeSlouching Towards Utopia,a€D by Brad 
DeLongaG! a magisterial history of what DeLong calls the a€oelong 20th century ,a€D running from 
1870 to 2010, an era that he saysa€! was shaped overwhelmingly by the economic consequences of 
technological progressa€!. For the great bulk of human historya€! Malthus was right: There were 
many technological innovations over the course of the millenniums, but the benefits of
these innovations were always swallowed up by population growth, driving living standards for most 
people back down to the edge of subsistence^!. Around 1870, however, the world entered an era of 
sustained rapid technological development that was unlike anything that had happened before; each 
successive generation found itself living in a new world, utterly transformed from the world into 
which its parents had been borna€!.

There are two great puzzlesa€!.

The first is why this happened. DeLong argues that there were three great a€cemeta-innovationsa€D 
(my term, not his)a€’’innovations that enabled innovation itself. These were the rise of large 
corporations, the invention of the industrial research lab and globalizationa€!.

The second is why all this technological progress hasna€™ t made society better than it has. One 
thing I hadna€™ t fully realized until reading a€oeSlouching Towards Utopiaa€D is the extent to 
which progress hasna€™ t brought felicity. Over the 140 years DeLong surveys, there have been only 
two eras during which the Western world felt generally optimistic about the way things were 
goinga€!. The firsta€! was the 40 or so years leading up to 1914, when people began to realize just 
how
much progress was being made and started to take it for granteda€!. The seconda€! was the a€ce30 
glorious yearsa€Da€! after World War II when social democracya€! seemed to be producing not Utopia, 
but the most decent societies humanity had ever known. But that era, too, came to an end, partly in 
the face of economic setbacks, but even more so in the face of ever more bitter politicsa€!.

The progress that brought us on-demand streaming music hasna€™ t made us satisfied or optimistic. 
DeLong offers some explanations for this disconnect, which I find interesting but not wholly 
persuasive. But his book definitely asks the right questions and teaches us a lot of crucial 
history along the waya€!

Of course, the industrial research lab, full globalization, and the modern corporation were not the 
only things going on as far as generators of global technological progressa€’’discovery, 
development, deployment, and diffusiona€”were concerned. But everything before had only pushed 
worldwide technological progress up to a proportional rate of 0.45%/year, on the edge of but not 
quite to disspell the Devil of Malthus. And as of 1870 it was not at all clear that that rate of 
technological progress could be sustained.
There had been a€ceefflorescencesa€D before, but they had not lasted. Was there as of 1870 yet 
sufficient reason to imagine that the Industrial Revolution was more than just another such 
a€oeefflorescencea€n, and that London would escape the fate of Nineveh, or Tyre?

It is after 1870 that the worldwide average rate of technological progress explodes: what Simon 
Kuznets first named a€oeModern Economic Growtha€D Growth jumped up from the 0.45%/year average 
proportional rate of 1770-1870 to the 2.1%/year average of 1870-2010. A full revolution in the 
global mode of production^”a doubling of humanitya€™ s technological competence^’’took 150 years at 
the pace of 1770-1870. It took only 33 years after 1870.
If one wanted to say that each quantitative doubling of human technological capability, measured in 
the sense of being able to support the same population at twice as high a living standard, is an 
equal qualitative change in the underlying mode of production, then starting from the standpoint of 
the 2035 built-out Information Age and looking backward in time, I see ten different a€oemodes of 
the forces of productionaGD since the dawn of agriculture:

Modes of the Forces Production in History

2035: Information Age

2002: Global Value-Chain Age
1969: Mass Consumption Age
1936: Mass Production Age
1903: Industrial Age

1870: Steam-Power Age

1605: Imperial-Commercial Age


1: Late Agrarian Age (feudal, ancient, asiatic)

-1300: Bronze Age

-4900: Neolithic Age

-13000: Mesolithic Age

If one follows this line of thought, then out of our ten a€oemodes of productiona€D in the past 
ten-thousand years, fully six have been in the past 200. If one thinks that on top of the forces 
there have to be built institutions that are the relations of production, and that on top of the 
forces-relations base one has to build the institutions that are the superstructures of society, 
then it is quite clear why not just utopia but even stable patterns of social order have been so 
hard to build in the Modern Economic Growth Age that
began in 1870: processes of institutional evolution and adjustment that we used to have hundreds or 
thousands of years to get right and file the rough edges off now take mere decades.

And I have written back:

Brad DeLong: Thank you very much. Blush. I hope that people incentivized to buy the book via your 
praise are not disappointeda€! <https://t.co/2mdNZlwhUE>
Tell me: You write:

The progress that brought us on-demand streaming music hasna€™ t made us satisfied or optimistic. 
DeLong offers some explanations for this disconnect, which I find interesting but not wholly 
persuasive. But his book definitely asks the right questions and teaches us a lot of crucial 
history along the way.

As I see it, the two big questions I dona€™ t deal with satisfactorily are

1. Why we have done so much better to spread biomedical in public health technology around the 
world to increase life expectancy then spreading the technologies of high productivity around the 
world.

2. Why was humanity so great during the Long 20th Century at:

o baking a bigger (much bigger! hugely bigger!! so big that now there are no barriers in terms of 
productivity for everyone to have what every previous civilization would have seen as enough) 
economic pie, while continuing to be so completely inept at both

o equitably slicing the pie, and

o tastinga€”enjoyinga€”the economic pie.

What do you say the answers to those two questions are? And what else do you think I have gotten 
BigTime wrong in the book?a€!

AJs:

This industrialization-education-language-nationalism cycle as one of the keys to much of post-1800 
history: Ernest Gellner was very wise indeed:

Cosma Shalizi: Ernest Gellner, Nations & Nationalism'. a€~The inhabitants ofa€! a€oeAgrariaa€n were 
economically static and internally culturally diversea€!. Because industrial economies continually 
make and put into practice technical and organizational innovationsa€! their occupational 
structures change significantly in a generationa€!. No one can expect to follow in the family 
professional. Training must be much more explicit, be couched in a far more universal idiom, and
emphasize understanding and manipulating nearly context-free symbolsa€!. It must in short take on 
the characteristics formerly associated with the literate High Cultures of Agrariaa€!. States 
become the protectors of High Cultures, of a€ceidiomsa€D; nationalism is the demand that each state 
succor and contain one and only one nation, one idioma€!. Faced with a difference between onea€™ s 
own idiom and that needed for success, people either acquire the latter, or see that their children
do (assimilation); force their own idiom into prominence (successful nationalism); or fester. Thus 
industrialism begets nationalism, and nationalism begets nationsa€!. It is hard to decide whether 
nationalists or anti-nationalists will find Nations and Nationalism more disturbing; rootless 
cosmopolitan though I am, it changed my mind on a great many subjects. This is already a rare 
enough achievement for a philosopher or social scientists I. Unfortunately for those of us not 
enamoured of
nationalism, he wasna€™ t talking rubbish at alla€!

A successful aggregator-monopolist does not manage to extract all of the consumer surplus for 
itselfa€’’the fact that you could spend your money on other things that are imperfect substitutes 
limits surplus extraction to about half. Unfortunately, another quarter of the consumer surplus 
vanishes to deadweight loss: monopoly is not a good market structure.
And, on the producer-surplus side, Amazona€™ s shift from being an intermediary that aggregates 
consumer information to guide usersa€™ attention to where it is likely to be best-satisfied to one 
that makes producers pay through the nose for that attentions’’that means that Amazon is likely to 
grab a huge proportion of producer surplus as well.

Thus I very, very much hope Web3 will come to our rescue, somehow, soon:

by self-publishing, crowdfunding and newsletters may seem daunting, but they only exist because 
there are countless people ready to pay good money for good writing. The future will always have a

Social engineering would, I always thought, mean that the panopticon would win in the struggle of 
anonymity vs. panopticon. I would not bet that the FBI, the NSA, and company have not already 
nailed who the original BitCoin 64 are, and are not working their way down the tree:

Physics ArXiv Blog: Why Bitcoina€™ s Anonymity Could Soon Collapse Like A House of Cards: a€~The 
distribution of Bitcoin very quickly followsa€! the Pareto distribution^!. Since it achieved $1 
parity, almost everyone using Bitcoin can be traced to one of the 64 founding accounts in less than 
six steps. So if the identities of first 64 agents are known, almost anyone else can be 
de-anonymized in just six steps or fewer. In this way, the anonymity of the entire network could 
fall like
dominoes. Thata€™ s interesting work that will make uncomfortable reading for more than a few 
individuals in the Bitcoin universea€!

Put me down as someone who thinks that consumers should wish for Web3, even though they do not know 
it yet:

Max Chafkin: Web3 Is the Big Idea Customers Didna€™t Ask For. a€~Seventeen years ago, Paul 
Grahama€! argueda€! entrepreneurs should be skeptical of venture capitalists, that they should be 
obsessively cheap, and that they should focus on small, unsexy markets. Above all, Graham urged 
founders to seek out customers from the very beginning and to respond to their needs. a€oeMake 
something customers actually want,a€D he said. Over the next two decades, this advice became
canonical in Silicon Valley. Graham co-founded an incubator and venture capital firm, Y 
Combinatora€!. The advice was applied to an entire generation of so-called Web 2.0 companiesa€”a
