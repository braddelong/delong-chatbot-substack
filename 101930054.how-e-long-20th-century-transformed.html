</strong>Welcome to Hub Dialogues. I’m your host, Sean Speer, editor-at-large at <em>The Hub</em>. I’m honoured to be joined today by J. Bradford DeLong, a well-known economic historian and professor at the University of California Berkeley who served as a senior official in the U.S. Treasury Department and is responsible for the widely read economics blog, <em>Brad Delong’s Grasping Reality</em>.</p><p>He’s also the author of the fascinating new book, <em>Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Twentieth Century</em>, which challenges conventional narratives about the economic story of the past 150 years or so. I’m grateful to speak with him about the book, including what he calls the “long 20th century,” the factors that produced significant economic growth over this period, and why it ultimately failed to produce the utopia that some had anticipated. Brad, thanks for joining us at Hub Dialogues. Congratulations on the book.</p><p><strong>BRAD DeLONG: </strong>Thank you for inviting me. It’s a great pleasure. I don’t know whether to be congratulated writing it. Certainly, I’m blessed, that when you write a book, you discover how many friends you have and also how many friends the book has. It is more than you would’ve imagined possible in terms of people who take your arguments seriously, who write in earnestly, and who ask their friends to read about it as well.</p><p><strong>SEAN SPEER: </strong>Well, as listeners will learn, I think that’s for good reason. There’s a ton of insight in the book</p><div class="file-embed-wrapper"><div class="file-embed-container-reader"><div class="file-embed-container-top"><image class="file-embed-thumbnail-default" src="https://substack.com/img/attachment_icon.svg"></image><div class="file-embed-details"><div class="file-embed-details-h1">2023 02 29 Delong Speer Hub Podcast</div><div class="file-embed-details-h2">149KB ∙ PDF File</div></div><a class="file-embed-button wide" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/api/v1/file/06d74387-4164-484e-846d-612e40280dcf.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div><a class="file-embed-button narrow" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/api/v1/file/06d74387-4164-484e-846d-612e40280dcf.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div></div><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/how-e-long-20th-century-transformed?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/how-e-long-20th-century-transformed?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>ONE VIDEO: Martin Wolf: The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism:</h2><ol><li><p>We created far too many angry, disappointed, furious disillusioned people; and they vote for crazies.</p></li><li><p>Do not be complacent about this! Enough angry and frightened people—and economics is essential to this—and you have serious trouble.</p></li><li><p>Our operating system—the marriage of liberal democracy and market capitalism—is one of complementary opposites. You cannot have democracy without a vibrant market economy that somewhat depoliticizes the determination of living standards. And not even plutocrats can flourish for long in an authoritarian kleptocracy, whether a Leninist one or otherwise. But liberal democracy and market capitalism are opposites.</p></li><li><p>Liberal democracy is, today, in “recession”.</p></li><li><p>The erosion of democracy we are seeing is the result of long-run economic failures in distribution, in mobility, and in growth. A financial crisis in which élites demonstrate themselves unworthy stewards and yet are rescued is an especially dangerous spark for trouble.</p></li><li><p>Disillusionment and loss of trust in élites led to trust in anti-pluralist crazies who claim that only their supporters are among the real people who are the only ones that matter.</p></li><li><p>The digital economy has played a huge role in creating a grifter-rentier economy, but more in destabilizing our society’s information nervous system.</p></li><li><p>If we are to get through this, we have to cool the rage—Trump and Bolsonaro are all about demolishing the “civil” part of politics-as-civil-war.</p></li><li><p>We need a new and renewed alliance of democracies, but we also need to coöperate with the autocracies on global issues.</p></li><li><p>A public-spirited and morally-centered élite is essential if our societal operating system is to endure.</p></li></ol><div id="youtube2-xsssYuj7gJc" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;xsssYuj7gJc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xsssYuj7gJc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/how-e-long-20th-century-transformed/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/how-e-long-20th-century-transformed/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Michael Spence and Belinda Azenui: </strong><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-productivity-growth-non-tradable-sectors-labor-shortages-by-michael-spence-and-belinda-azenui-2023-02">America’s Widening Productivity Gap</a>: ‘There was not always a large gap between the tradable and non-tradable sectors.

It flagged the slowness of restructuring the vast tangled web of property developers — bond prices indicate that <em>38 per cent</em> of them have or will default — and seems unconvinced by Beijing’s insistence that everything is now fine…. The IMF wants China to set up “more robust mechanisms” to restructure distressed real estate developers, curtail off-balance-sheet borrowing by local governments and state-owned enterprises, and strengthen the banking system to contain the financial stability risks.
