<p>Yesterday all the past. The language of size<br>Spreading to China along the trade-routes; the diffusion<br>Of the counting-frame and the cromlech;<br>Yesterday the shadow-reckoning in the sunny climates.</p><p>Yesterday the assessment of insurance by cards,<br>The divination of water; yesterday the invention<br>Of cartwheels and clocks, the taming of<br>Horses. Yesterday the bustling world of the navigators.</p><p>Yesterday the abolition of fairies and giants,<br>the fortress like a motionless eagle eyeing the valley,<br>the chapel built in the forest;<br>Yesterday the carving of angels and alarming gargoyles;</p><p>The trial of heretics among the columns of stone;<br>Yesterday the theological feuds in the taverns<br>And the miraculous cure at the fountain;<br>Yesterday the Sabbath of witches; but to-day the struggle</p><p>Yesterday the installation of dynamos and turbines,<br>The construction of railways in the colonial desert;<br>Yesterday the classic lecture<br>On the origin of Mankind. But to-day the struggle.</p><p>Yesterday the belief in the absolute value of Greek,<br>The fall of the curtain upon the death of a hero;<br>Yesterday the prayer to the sunset<br>And the adoration of madmen. but to-day the struggle.</p><p>As the poet whispers, startled among the pines,<br>Or where the loose waterfall sings compact, or upright<br>On the crag by the leaning tower:<br>“O my vision. O send me the luck of the sailor.”</p><p>And the investigator peers through his instruments<br>At the inhuman provinces, the virile bacillus<br>Or enormous Jupiter finished:<br>“But the lives of my friends. I inquire. I inquire.”</p><p>And the poor in their fireless lodgings, dropping the sheets<br>Of the evening paper: “Our day is our loss. O show us<br>History the operator, the<br>Organiser. Time the refreshing river.”</p><p>And the nations combine each cry, invoking the life<br>That shapes the individual belly and orders<br>The private nocturnal terror:<br>"Did you not found the city state of the sponge,</p><p>“Raise the vast military empires of the shark<br>And the tiger, establish the robin’s plucky canton?<br>Intervene. O descend as a dove or<br>A furious papa or a mild engineer, but descend.”</p><p>And the life, if it answers at all, replied from the heart<br>And the eyes and the lungs, from the shops and squares of the city<br>"O no, I am not the mover;<br>Not to-day; not to you. To you, I’m the</p><p>"Yes-man, the bar-companion, the easily-duped;<br>I am whatever you do. I am your vow to be<br>Good, your humorous story.<br>I am your business voice. I am your marriage.</p><p>“What’s your proposal? To build the just city? I will.<br>I agree. Or is it the suicide pact, the romantic<br>Death? Very well, I accept, for<br>I am your choice, your decision. Yes, I am Spain.”</p><p>Many have heard it on remote peninsulas,<br>On sleepy plains, in the aberrant fishermen’s islands<br>Or the corrupt heart of the city.<br>Have heard and migrated like gulls or the seeds of a flower.</p><p>They clung like burrs to the long expresses that lurch<br>Through the unjust lands, through the night, through the alpine tunnel;<br>They floated over the oceans;<br>They walked the passes. All presented their lives.</p><p>On that arid square, that fragment nipped off from hot<br>Africa, soldered so crudely to inventive Europe;<br>On that tableland scored by rivers,<br>Our thoughts have bodies; the menacing shapes of our fever</p><p>Are precise and alive. For the fears which made us respond<br>To the medicine ad, and the brochure of winter cruises<br>Have become invading battalions;<br>And our faces, the institute-face, the chain-store, the ruin</p><p>Are projecting their greed as the firing squad and the bomb.<br>Madrid is the heart. Our moments of tenderness blossom<br>As the ambulance and the sandbag;<br>Our hours of friendship into a people’s army.</p><p>To-morrow, perhaps the future. The research on fatigue<br>And the movements of packers; the gradual exploring of all the Octaves of radiation;<br>To-morrow the enlarging of consciousness by diet and breathing.</p><p>To-morrow the rediscovery of romantic love,<br>the photographing of ravens; all the fun under<br>Liberty’s masterful shadow;<br>To-morrow the hour of the pageant-master and the musician,</p><p>The beautiful roar of the chorus under the dome;<br>To-morrow the exchanging of tips on the breeding of terriers,<br>The eager election of chairmen<br>By the sudden forest of hands. But to-day the struggle.</p><p>To-morrow for the young the poets exploding like bombs,<br>The walks by the lake, the weeks of perfect communion;<br>To-morrow the bicycle races<br>Through the suburbs on summer evenings. But to-day the struggle.</p><p>To-day the deliberate increase in the chances of death,<br>The consious acceptance of guilt in the necessary murder;<br>To-day the expending of powers<br>On the flat ephemeral pamphlet and the boring meeting.</p><p>To-day the makeshift consolations: the shared cigarette,<br>The cards in the candlelit barn, and the scraping concert,<br>The masculine jokes; to-day the<br>Fumbled and unsatisfactory embrace before hurting.</p><p>The stars are dead. The animals will not look.<br>We are left alone with our day, and the time is short, and<br>History to the defeated<br>May say Alas but cannot help nor pardon.</p><p>LINK:&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/upr.edu/modernpoetry/Student-Blogs/ivan-andres-rodriguez/spainbywhauden">https://sites.google.com/a/upr.edu/modernpoetry/Student-Blogs/ivan-andres-rodriguez/spainbywhauden</a></p>
