OA34er Things Azt Went Whizzing bya€!

Very Briefly Noted:

•  Branko Milanovic: Western money and Eastern promises: a€~It is a grand bazaar. Gorbachev begins 
by asking DM 20 billion in order to remove Soviet troops from Eastern Germany. Kohl comes with only 
DM 5 billion. He asks Americans to help: they refuse. Kohl then scrambles to find a total of DM 8 
billion, the offer that Gorbachev rejects as a a€oedead enda€D. Kohl moves to DM 12 billion. Still 
no good. In desperation, Kohl offers an
additional DM 3 billion of interest-free loans. Deala€!

•  Nate Silver: Candidate Quality Mattered: a€~As it often does: I wrote about my three key 
questions heading into Election Daya€l polling err or a€ I turnouta€l the third question, about 
whether candidate quality would matter, is the easiest to answer: Ita€™ s a resounding yesa€l. Look 
at the large difference between Senate and gubernatorial results in states with both types of 
racesa€!

•  Peter Leyden: The Great Progression, 2025-2050: a€~The next 25 years will see the introduction 
and scaling up ofa€! energya€l biotecha€l infotecha€l. Authoritarian closed societies always lose 
to open democracies in the long runa€l

• Michelle Goldberg: Herea€™ s Hoping Elon Musk Destroys Twitter: a€~Twitter as like staying too 
late at a bad party full of people who hate you. I now think this was too generous to Twitter. I 
mean, even the worst parties end. Twitter is more like an existentialist parable of a party, with 
disembodied souls trying and failing to be properly seen, forever. Ita€™ s not surprising that the 
platforma€™ s most prolific users often refer to it as a€oethis
hellsitea€Ua€l

AJs:

The Economist: The spectacular fall of FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried: a€~The apparent size of the hole 
in ftxa€™ s balance-sheet indicates problems ran far deeper than a rival starting rumours. The 
details of what went wrong in the beanbag-strewn offices of ftx and Alameda are not yet clear. An 
exchange, which sits between buyer and seller and takes a spread, should not be an easy business to 
bankrupt. It is not typically exposed to runs, since it merely holds
assets on behalf of investorsa€l. The crypto winter had previously claimed only the types of 
victims that would be expected, including a poorly designed stablecoin, a hedge fund and several 
platforms that made risky loans. That it has come for ftx, a well-regarded business, and Mr 
Bankman-Fried is an enormous blow. It has left other institutions scrambling to reassure customers. 
Coinbase, a large exchange, has sent out reassuring missives to the press. Its share
price has nevertheless shed a fifth of its value in recent days, and is close to all-time lowsa€l

Charles Dickens: Little Dorrit: a€~Mr Merdle was immensely rich; a man of prodigious enterprise; a 
Midas without the ears, who turned all he touched to gold. He was in everything good, from banking 
to building. He was in Parliament, of course. He was in the City, necessarily. He was Chairman of 
this, Trustee of that, President of the other. The weightiest of men had said to projectors, 
a€oeNow, what name have you got? Have you got Merdle?a€D And, the
reply being in the negative, had said, a€oeThen I wona€™t look at you.a€Da€! But, at about the time 
of High a€~Change, Pressure began to wane, and appalling whispers to circulate, east, west, north, 
and south. At first they were faint, and went no further than a doubt whether Mr Merdlea€™ s wealth 
would be found to be as vast as had been supposed; whether there might not be a temporary 
difficulty in a€~realisinga€™ it; whether there might not even be a
temporary suspension (say a month or so), on the part of the wonderful Bank. As the whispers became 
louder, which they did from that time every minute, they became more threateningaCI

Duncan Weldon: Learning the wrong lessons: a€~The BOE was already raising interest rates to bring 
inflation back to target. Given that looser fiscal policy would add to demand and hence spending 
the Bank would have to raise interest rates at a faster pace and to a higher terminal value to 
offset the governmentaC™ s actions. Looser fiscal policy meant tighter monetary policy and 
therefore, gilts fell in value. But that was not all that was going on. There was
