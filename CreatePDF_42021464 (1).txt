Let me explain why:

Around 1600 in Western Europe people woke up, perhaps for the first time, and noticed that history 
had a direction that was being driven by increasing human technological
Capabilities <https://archive.org/details/idealcommonwealtOOmore>. Before 1600, you see, people had 
looked back to the past for golden ages of demigods, great thinkers, even
massive constructions. When they looked to the future for any form of paradise, it was a religious 
onea€”not one to be built by human minds and hands. And when they looked to
their own society, it was as though it was much the same, or perhaps inferior, to the past: Henry 
VIII Tudor and his retinue being a court much of the same mold as those of
Agamemnon, or Tiberius Caesar, or Arthur.

Since that day, conservatives who have reacted to the political implications of changing technology 
and society have gathered themselves into four different types of parties.

The first is that of the reactionariesa€”those who simply want to stand a€oeathwart history, 
yelling a€™ STOP!a€™ a€D. They see themselves at war with a dystopian a€oearmed
doctrinea€D with which no compromise is possible or desirable. In the fight against this, no 
possible alliance can be rejected with those who would otherwise be judged evil or
found contemptible

The second is that of a party of a€oeWhig measures and Tory mena€D. Technology and society and 
humanity are changing, in ways that can be turned to human advantage and
flourishing, but those who guide the changes must be those who have a keen appreciation of the 
value of our historical patrimony and of the dangers of leveling all that is to rubble
before building anew. a€oelf we want things to stay the same, things will have to changea€D, says 
Tancred to his uncle the Prince of Salina in Giuseppe Tomasi di
Lampedusaa€™   s The Leopard <https://archive .org/details/leopard001amp>.

The third is a type of conservative party found primarily (but not exclusively) in America, a 
conservative party of a type that has adapted itself to a society that sees itself as
overwhelmingly new and liberal <https://archive.org/details/liberaltraditionOOOOhart>. It is a 
party of a type that Trumana€™ s former Secretary of State Dean Acheson described in
the                                                                               1950s 
<https://archive.org/details/democratlooksathOOache>. It is not a party of tradition and inherited 
status. It is a party of wealth and businessa€”of the application of
technology to production, of entrepreneurship, and of enterprise. It is the party of those who were 
or who were confident they would become prosperous and rich, because they

could surf the waves of Schumpeterian creative distraction that technological advance in the 
context of a market economy generates.

And the fourth is the party of the fearful: those who believe that they will be creatively 
destroyed by the processes of historical change, and that they are beset on all sides by
internal and external enemies who are much more powerful and are eager to deprive them of their 
place: to a€cecancela€D them.

What I have learned from my reading of Dan Ziblatt and Steve Levitsky <https://archive 
.org/details/HowDemocraciesDieStevenLevitsky> <https://books.google.com/?
id=cfOkDgAAQBAJ> is that democratic political institutions can be stable and countries can be 
well-governed only if their conservative parties are of types (2) and (3), and not if
they      are of types (1) and (4). To their many examples, let me add one more. Looking back a 
centurdy and more ago, Great Britaina€™ s astonishingly rapid political and economic
decline from its position as the worlda€™ s hyperpower was significantly accelerated by the 
then-transformation of its Tory Party into a party of types (1) and (4)a€”the party of
Mafeking Night celebrations and armed resistance to Irish constitutional reforma€”in what George 
Dangerfield called The Strange Death of Liberal England

<https: //archive .org/details/strangedeathofliOOdang>.

Geoffrey Kabaservice tells us the story of how Americaa€™ s Republican Party has put itself on an 
analogous course, so that now when I look out at the world I see very, very few
elements of (2) and (3) in todaya€™ s American Republican Party, and those are fast disappearing 
under the desperate struggle by Republican politicians and their tame ideologues
to somehow pick up the mantle of Donald Trump. It is very clear that this needs to be reversed, as 
rapidly and completely as possible. But I am not smart enough to understand how
it could be.
