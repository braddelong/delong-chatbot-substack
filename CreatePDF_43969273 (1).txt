The 1920 campaign biography of Herbert Hoover written by the daughter of Laura Ingalls Wilder (and 
editor of her Little House on the Prarie books), Rose Wilder Lane, goes truly bonkers in its 
account of Herbert Hoover and the Kaiping mine.

In the biography, Rose Wilder Lane (1920), The Making of Herbert Hoover (New York: The Century 
Company) <https://archive.org/details/cu31924030938983>, she starts by writing of Qing Mines 
Director-General Chang Yenmao as some sort of wuxia figure, and goes from there:

A tall, impassive Chinese was Chang Yen Mao. The quick American eye took in his six feet of live 
muscle,his strong shoulders,his straight carriage. For all his fifty years and his suavely folded 
hands,not a man to be easily handled in a scrap. Nor in business, either; not with that lidless eye 
that saw everything and nothing at once. He had known many things in his time, that man.

DD coolie lad born in a starving village on the banks of the Pei-ho River, he had in his childhood 
watched the great silken-canopied boat of the empress go slowly over the yellow water, pro pelled 
by long sweeps of red-lacquered oars; he had gazed at the two eyes of lacquer and pearl on its 
prow,the teak-wood cabins carved and inlaid and shuttered with painted gauzes, the gold embroidered 
robes and jeweled fingers and
proud two-eyed peacock feathers of the courtiers who sat on the deck drinking tea from tiny 
priceless cups, while servants stirred the scented air with slow movements of great fans and 
musicians wove a silver thread of harmony through their meditations.

Ten years passed before the boat of the empress passed that way again,but when it came the coolie 
lad was ready. On the low muddy bank in the sunshine he stood, a slim youth erect and 
steel-muscled, two huge two-edged swords making rings of silver fire around him. All that skilled 
Chinese swordsmen and famous jugglers had ever done he did,and more pending a voiceless prayer 
across the yellow water to the power
behind the silken gauzes. His prayer was answere ; the empress summoned him. He bowed low to the 
polished deck before her cabin ,in the midst of the court, and her voice came from it, making him 
Master of the Imperial Stables.

He taught the young emperor, Tung-chih, how to ride. Who shall say how the accident occurred that 
would have left empty the Dragon Throne had not Chang Yen Mao been quick and ready to save the 
Heaven-Bor ? In the great palaces of the Forbidden City the wise courtiers said nothing; nothing 
could be proved. Chang Yen Mao had saved the boy. And he had been made Chamberlain of the Court.

Master of the Imperial Stables.

He taught the young emperor, Tung-chih, how to ride. Who shall say how the accident occurred that 
would have left empty the Dragon Throne had not Chang Yen Mao been quick and ready to save the 
Heaven-Bor ? In the great palaces of the Forbidden City the wise courtiers said nothing; nothing 
could be proved. Chang Yen Mao had saved the boy. And he had been made Chamberlain of the Court.

He was Chamberlain of the Court when the young emperor died,and,China had no ruler. It was night, 
and the great gates of Peking were closed. Without the walls, at his palace in the country,was the 
littlethree-year-old Kwang-Hsu, nephew of the empress. Eight hours before the gates could be 
opened. Much may be done in eight hours,in the whispering walls of an imperial palace where an 
emperor lies dead and only a
woman stands alone against fierce ambitions. The empress sent in haste for Chang Yen Mao. He 
listened,and bowed,and withdrew. In the clothing of a servant he slipped through the Peking 
streets, over the wall, then across the fields to the country place of Kwang-Hsu, and raced back 
through the night with the boy in his arms. A trusted servant watching from the top of the towering 
wall let down a rope,and somehow, in the
darkness, with the heir to all China bound on his back,Chang Yen Mao did what had never been 
donea€”he scaled the city wall o fPeking. Dawn found the court decorous and calm , the little 
Kwang-Hsu proclaimed the emperor, the Divinely Appointed, the Son of Heaven, and the empress 
dowager began her undisputed reign.

These were the tales rumor whispered of the devious years through which the coolie lad of the river 
village had come to hold in his hands all the wealth of China's mines. Decidedly, he was a man of 
power and purpose, not to be lightly regarded by a young American mining engineer as he stood calm 
in his palace gates replying in slid ing, elusive Chinese to the interpreter's greetinga€!
[a€i]

The compound of his palace was in an uproar. Feet clattered on the graveled paths,voices chat tered 
everywhere. The thousand Chinese impris oned there during the siege were struggling each with his 
own indecisions. Foreign troops controlled the town; fighting was still going on to the northward, 
but the river as open to Tong Ku. Chang's sharp-voiced Number One wife with all her servants and 
retainers clamored to be
taken to Japana€!. Chang Yen Mao hada€! come to ask Herbert Hoover to take to London Chang's 
proposal that an English company take over the mines and develop them under the protection of the 
Allies. Already the Russians and Japanese were marching upon the mines with the intention of 
seizing them. There was need for haste. But the interests of China must be guarded. Chinese must 
share with foreigners the
ownership and con trol of the minesa€!. The papers were prepared; the contracts, the power of 
attorney to Herbert Hoover, signed in India ink by Changa€™ s brusha€!. Hoover sailed for Londona€! 
as a fledgling financier with valuable mining properties in his breast pocketa€!.

A holding companya€!. A second companya€! toa€! float the stocka€!. The Chinese Engineering and 
Mining Company, Ltd., took over the actual development of the mines, and Herbert Hoover returned to 
China as its general manager, with a crumb from the financial feasta€”fifty thousand dollarsa€™ 
worth of stock in the companya€!. Chang Yen Mao stood firm in his insistence that the company 
should be controlled
equally by Chinese and foreigners, that Chinese must be on the board of directors, and that the 
central offices of the company should be in Chinaa€!.

A memorandum was drawn, signed by Chang Yen Mao and by Herbert Hoover as representative of the 
company; it was ratified by cable from London. The fina larrang ments were completed, and the 
transfer was made. Now for the real job of developing the mines !
He began his wor kconfidently and happily. At last he had a free hand in the carrying out of the 
plans so long delayed by the baffling web of Chinese evasionsa€!.

[a€i]

But Chang Yen Mao was perturbed. He consulted anxiously with his young friend. Thedirectors of the 
company were meeting in Brussels, on the other side of the world. The Chinese directors had no 
voice in their decisions. When were the terms of the memorandum to be carried out? When were the 
central offices to be in China ?

The foreign powers had not held territory in China, as had been feared. The dowager empress still 
ruled the empire from the labyrinths of the Forbidden City, and her eyes rested coldly on her 
former favorite,Chang Yen Mao. Had he sold to the hated foreigners the mines she had given into his 
care?a€! Chang Yen Mao was calm , but in his eyes a failing hope begged reassurance.

It was not difficult to give. The terms of the memorandum would undoubtedly be carried out; these 
things took time. The memorandum had been included in the agreement mad ; Chang's condition had 
been made thoroughly clear in London. The general manager of the mines had nothing to do with these 
matters ;his responsibility had ended with the forming of the company, in which Chang's wishes had 
been scrupulously
carried out. In the meantime the mines were daily pouring out more coal, and it was in them that 
his interest laya€!.

The blow fell suddenly, with the arrival of two young Belgiansa€!. Belgian and german interest had 
bought out English and Chinese stockholdersa€!. The board of directors repudiated the original 
agreement which the former owners of the company had made with Herbert Hoover. The memorandum would 
not hold in law, because the paper on which it was written was not attached to the paper on which 
the option was
writtena€!. The control of the mines rested entirely in foreign handsaC!.

Chang Yen Mao heard this statement in silence, sitting upright on a plush-upholstered arm-chair in 
the drawing-room of the great palace that he had made European because he was a progressive Chinese 
eager to help in the modernizing of China. Then he rose in his robes of heavy silk edged with 
wave-borders of color and dismissed his Western visitors. He had seen in their faces that they 
spoke the truth; he had betrayed
China,and it is not becoming that a man, like a rat, should scurry into corners seeking escape from 
the consequences of his deedsa€!.

The young American was angry, burning with a sense of outraged justice and with scorn of men who 
seize on legal quibbles to cover broken faith. He came to assure Chang Yen Mao that he had had no 
part in this calamity; that he would not be a party to it; that he would leave China before he 
would consent to it. These protestations were unnecessary . Chang Yen Mao had long known that the 
young American was honest
and his trust in him was unshaken.

Herbert Hoover went out to struggle in the Western way with an implacable fact. Nothing could be 
done. The board of directors persisted in its refusal to carry ou tthe terms of the memorandum and 
stood on its legal rights. It was a lesson in differing national points of view for a young man of 
twenty-five; English and Americans, he found, worked together in amity on the basis of the spirit 
of an agreement; Continental
financiers followed an agreement to the letter.

He resigned the managership^!.

Chang Yen Mao remained quietly behind his screen of teak-wood and silka€I awaiting the fatal 
command from Peking. It came at last, a scroll of parchment rolled on an ivory wand and wrapped in 
silk tied with golden cordsa€”a formal request from the empress to come to Peking and be 
beheadedaCI.

Chang Yen Mao,it will be better for you to remain in your own palace to-night.a€D Chang rose 
quickly, with a movement startling in its swiftness. He stood straight to his full six feeta€! ,but 
his rising was hardly more swift than the appearance of Wilson's revolver. aCceSit down,Chang Yen 
Maoa€!. If you take one step toward that door or call just once, I will shoot. Sit downa€! and 
listen to me.a€Da€l Wilsona€!
explained the situation with lucid Western logic. A Chinese friend of Chang Yen Mao had sent Wilson 
the news of the death sentence, begging him to keep the victim from Peking at any cost. He himself 
had hastened to set in motion wheels within wheels in the Forbidden City. It might yet be possible 
to prevail upon the empress to withdraw the imperial commanda€I.

Chang Yen Mao might live, disgraced. His peacock feather was taken from him ;the red translucent 
jewel of a Number Two mandarin was shorn from his cap. No longer might he wear the thumb-ring of 
three-colored jade,and never again could he enter the presence of the empressa€!. A broken man, 
still erect amid the ruin of his life, he said farewell to Herbert Hoover on the day before the 
sailing of the ship that would take
the young American home. Their friendship had withstood the calamity in which their association 
ended, but the memory of it was bitter to the younger man. a€oel shall never return to China," he 
saida€!.

[a€!]

The old Chinese trouble slowly rose again,like a mysterious cloud on the horizon. Little rumors ran 
be fore it as puffs of dusty wind before a storm. It was whispered that there had been something 
shady, something tricky, in his connection with that old affair of thememorandum. To-day one heard 
that he had betrayed Chinese who trusted him ; to-morrow , that he had refused to save Chang Yen 
Mao's life at the hands of a
firing squad until the old Chinese had bought his help with an offer of fabulously rich minesa€!. 
They had arisen out of nothing,out ofthe air,created themselves between a smile and a glance, over 
tea-cups on hotel verandas in China and Japan, where life is so wearisome for the foreigner that 
the dullest become imaginative. They had risen like a swarm of gnats and circled half the world to 
reach London far in advance of the
ship that brought Chang Yen Mao and his Chinese associates to fight their case in an English 
courta€!.

It was a relief when the routine of the case called him to testify to his part in the affair, to 
establish clearly the validity of the memorandum he had drawn so long ago as mediator between the 
two contesting factions. In short decisive sentencA's, hard and square as bricks piled upon bricks, 
he told the plain, unassailable facts. H e had taken the original agreement to London upon the 
authority and at the request of Chang Yen
Mao. He had signed the memorandum with full authority from Bewick, Moreing. He had con sistently 
and continually maintained that the terms of the memorandum should be carried out. He had protested 
at every opportunity against the action of the board of directors in repudiating it. The success of 
the Chinese suit hung upon his testimony, and his testimony stood unshaken and incontrovertiblea€!.
