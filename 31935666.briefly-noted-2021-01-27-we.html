On the 13th, the vaccinated group’s rate fell slightly. Then, on day 14, it dropped by a third….

The long road to another common cold. One of the essential factors governing the future of COVID–19 is our immunity to the illness…. Past studies make clear that partial immunity can keep people from getting seriously ill, even as coronaviruses successfully enter their systems.

The overeager&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;noted that in the first “hours” (!) of Biden’s presidency, there hadn’t yet been any “tangible actions” towards bipartisanship, such as adopting “Republican priorities.” Instead, the Democrat’s outreach had been “more about words.” Days later at a White House press briefing, it was a Times reporter again who pressed the issue, demanding to know, “When are we going to see one of those substantial outreaches that says , ‘This is something the Republicans want to do, too’?”… To date, there’s been virtual no news coverage on which “Democratic priorities” the GOP is willing to adopt in the name of unity… LINK:&nbsp;<a href="https://pressrun.media/p/biden-the-press-and-the-unity-charade">https://pressrun.media/p/biden-the-press-and-the-unity-charade</a></p><p></p><p><strong>John Ganz</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Third Republic &amp; Today</em>: ‘There is a spookily close parallel with an event that occurred in the late French Third Republic—the attempt by right-wing militants to march on the Chambre des députés in the night of February 6, 1934. In the street fighting between police and marchers on the bridge that links the Place de la Concorde to the Chambre sixteen people were killed. That demonstration and the polarization that it reflected and deepened are often considered to mark the beginning of the process that led to the fall of the Republic and arrival of the Vichy regime. I couldn’t help but think of that last evening as we watched the unbelievable images on TV….. To kick off my Substack, I am going to take a look in a multi-part series at two crises of the Third Republic: first, the Dreyfus affair around the turn of the century, which gave birth to an insane form of conspiratorialism and a reactionary nationalism with racial underpinnings, according to some scholars the first hints of what would become fascism, and then the February 6 crisis of 1934, which still generates a controversy whether it was a failed fascist coup or the somewhat farcical demonstration of a disorganized radical right… LINK:&nbsp;<a href="https://johnganz.substack.com/p/the-third-republic-and-today">https://johnganz.substack.com/p/the-third-republic-and-today</a></p><p></p><p><strong>Noah Smith</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Can knowledge industries escape superstar cities?</em>: ‘Here’s what would be required. It’s a tall order…. So far, clustering has just conquered everything. Insane rents and house prices, crazy numbers of car break-ins, massive homelessness, dysfunctional social services, deep social tensions between transplants and natives… nothing could knock SF off its perch. NYC, Seattle, Los Angeles, and other Superstar Cities were less dysfunctional, but they’ve all had their own affordability crises over the past decade, and yet their positions have also seemed unassailable. Essentially, this has made knowledge industry workers, and the companies that employ them, prisoners of superstar cities…. The question is whether Zoom and Slack are game-changers…. This is a hard question to answer…. But it’s also important to remember that companies don’t have to go fully distributed in order to mostly escape the pull of the superstar cities. They just have to shrink their main offices, and manage the rest of their workers either remotely or at branch offices in cheaper places….. In order to escape the cluster cities, both businesses and workers will have to learn to do job search and hiring mostly remotely (except for flyouts for a few very high-value workers)…. Knowledge spillovers… is going to be harder…. City lifestyle… is the final hurdle, and—I predict—the hardest one to solve. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible, though. Cities are not awesome for everyone… LINK:&nbsp;<a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/can-knowledge-industries-escape-superstar">https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/can-knowledge-industries-escape-superstar</a></p><p></p><p><strong>Economist</strong>:&nbsp;<em>How to defuse a bomb—Can China’s long property boom hold?</em>: ‘LOTTERY WINNERS normally win money. In China the big prize is being allowed to spend it. Demand for new homes in good locations is so high, and supply so limited, that several cities use lotteries to allocate them, some with odds as low as 1 in 60…. Similar splits are common around the world, with prices high in large cities and low in small towns. But the degree of the divergence in China, multiplied by the sheer size and growth of its market, means that understanding property is essential if you want to get to grips with what is happening in the economy. Every year China starts building about 15m new homes, more than quintuple the amount in America and Europe combined. The property sector—both the direct impact of all the construction and its indirect effect on everything from concrete to curtains—accounts for a quarter of China’s GDP… LINK:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/01/25/can-chinas-long-property-boom-hold">https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/01/25/can-chinas-long-property-boom-hold</a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-2021-01-27-we/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-2021-01-27-we/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-2021-01-27-we?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-2021-01-27-we?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Grasping Reality Newsletter, by Brad DeLong&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Grasping Reality Newsletter, by Brad DeLong</span></a></p><p></p>
