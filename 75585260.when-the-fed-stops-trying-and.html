And I find it disturbing that, in its rhetoric at least, the Federal Reserve is no longer trying to find it. Claiming that it will keep raising interest rates until after there are clear signs that the labor market is in a substantial downturn is a recipe for subsequent panicked cutting of interest rates back to the zero lower bound, after which the Federal Reserve will have next to no traction to boost the economy, and the chances of a rapid return to full employment will then be very bad:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Brad DeLong</strong>: <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/fed-not-searching-for-optimal-path-between-stagnation-stagflation-by-j-bradford-delong-2022-09">When the Fed Stops Trying</a>: ‘Today it is unclear whether there is still a safe path between Scylla and Charybdis. But following two more 75-bps hikes in July and September, I worry that the Fed has given up on even trying to find it. Instead, like Odysseus, it has intentionally started to hew toward Scylla (secular stagnation), viewing it as the lesser of two evils. One no longer hears Fed officials cautioning that last winter and spring’s tightening has yet to ramify fully throughout the economy. Instead, the Fed has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/fed-set-big-rate-hike-waters-get-choppy-worlds-central-banks-2022-09-21/">signaled</a> another 1.25-bps’ worth of hikes to come before the end of this year.</p><p>US Secretary of the Treasury and former Fed Chair Janet Yellen once told me that the Fed’s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will tend to overreact to the immediate news cycle unless it bases its thinking on some transparent formula <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/fed-average-inflation-targeting-should-still-be-rules-based-by-john-taylor-5-2020-10">like the Taylor Rule</a>.

"Secret Congress” has only worked over the past two years, when it has worked, because Republicans think that they need to give centrist Democrats enough of a steam valve release to keep them from shifting to the same level of support for Schumer that all Republicans give to McConnell. “Secret Congress” is unstable, and occurs only when Democrats have majorities anyway. And after the midterm, the presidential election is immediately on the horizon:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Josh Barro</strong>: <a href="https://www.joshbarro.com/p/permitting-reform-will-live-another?utm_source=email">Permitting Reform Will Live Another Day</a>: ‘The parties have actually moved closer on these issues, which bodes well for eventual reform…. Why should Democrats invest in trying to block projects like Manchin’s beloved Mountain Valley Pipeline? We need more natural gas production and transmission, both to make Europe’s turn away from Russian gas possible, and in order to support wind and solar projects that rely on natural gas infrastructure…. We need backup gas generation we can turn on when it’s cloudy (or not windy) out, or else we’ll have to rely on coal…. [The] Democrat[ic]… party was overwhelmingly ready to swallow any objections and pass a reform package on the terms Manchin set if Republicans would cooperate. But they wouldn’t—on Tuesday, Mitch McConnell unloaded on Manchin’s proposal <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3663695-mcconnell-blasts-manchin-permitting-bill-as-poison-pill-phony-fig-leaf/">in a way I find mostly disingenuous</a>…. McConnell’s overriding motivation here in torpedoing Manchin’s baby was political: to avoid handing Biden and Manchin another big bipartisan win so close to Election Day….</p><p>Permitting reform is now the sort of initiative that would be best handled in “Secret Congress”… a lower-profile way to move legislation to their shared ends without anybody taking too much credit or blame…. Republicans will surely want to say this isn’t <em>Manchin’s</em> reform package—Capito has her own competing proposal—and maybe the parties can agree to disagree on whose idea this all was. But the underlying incentives for getting a deal done here, sooner or later, are pretty good…</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Image: Inflation:</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816b9e5b-3326-464b-a100-0de96ee1282e_2332x798.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816b9e5b-3326-464b-a100-0de96ee1282e_2332x798.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816b9e5b-3326-464b-a100-0de96ee1282e_2332x798.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816b9e5b-3326-464b-a100-0de96ee1282e_2332x798.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816b9e5b-3326-464b-a100-0de96ee1282e_2332x798.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/816b9e5b-3326-464b-a100-0de96ee1282e_2332x798.png" width="1456" height="498" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/816b9e5b-3326-464b-a100-0de96ee1282e_2332x798.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:498,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:85593,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816b9e5b-3326-464b-a100-0de96ee1282e_2332x798.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816b9e5b-3326-464b-a100-0de96ee1282e_2332x798.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816b9e5b-3326-464b-a100-0de96ee1282e_2332x798.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816b9e5b-3326-464b-a100-0de96ee1282e_2332x798.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>PCE deflator inflation has been bouncing around 5%/year for a year and a half now, without it leading to any shift in long-term bond market expectations of what out-year inflation is going to be.
