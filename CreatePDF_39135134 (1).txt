The extent to which democratization really mattereda€”the extent to which the proletarian and 
peasant masses could and did exercise influence over the government by voting for
representatives as opposed to simply threatening riot or revolutiona€”was and is a greatly 
contested one. For example, consider Friedrich Engels (1884) on the relative autonomy
of the statea€!

First, he glosses the Communist ManifestoaC™ s aCcethe executive of the modern state is but a 
committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisiea€Da€”
aCceDie moderne Staatsgewalt ist nur ein AusschuAY, der die gemeinschaftlichen GeschA^fte der 
ganzen Bourgeoisklasse verwalteta€Da€”a€oethe modern state is nothing but
an association for managing the affairs of the business classa€D:

Friedrich Engels (1884): The Relative Autonomy of the State 
<<https://www.bradford-delong.eom/2020/03/friedrich-engels-1884-_the-origin-of-the-
family-private-property-and-the-state -the-state-is-normally-the-stat.html»: a€~The state... is 
normally the state of the most powerful, economically
ruling          class, which by its means becomes also the politically ruling class, and so 
acquires new means of holding down and exploiting the oppressed. The

ancient state was, above all, the state of the slave-owners for holding down the slaves, just as 
the feudal state was the organ of the nobility for holding
down the peasant serfs and bondsmen, and the modern representative state is the instrument for 
exploiting wage-labor by capital.

But Engels finds that the Communist Manifestod€™ s 1848 formulation is not adequate toward any 
productive discussion of what was to him modern politics and of political
strategy. And so in 1884 Engels issues a very important qualification indeed:

Exceptional periods, however, occur when the warring classes are so nearly equal in forces that the 
state power, as apparent mediator, acquires for the
moment a certain independence in relation to both. This applies to the absolute monarchy of the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which balances the
nobility and the bourgeoisie against one another, and to the Bonapartism of the First and 
particularly of the Second French Empire, which played off the
proletariat against the bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie against the proletariat. The latest 
achievement in this line, in which ruler and ruled look equally
comic,    is the new German Empire of the Bismarckian nation; here the capitalists and the workers 
are balanced against one another and both of them fleeced
for the benefit of the decayed Prussian cabbage-aquires.

In short, aCcemodern state-power is an association for managing the common affairs of the entire 
bourgeoisiea€D needs to be strongly qualified in every case Engels runs up
against in his day:

Moreover, there is another qualification that Engels finds necessary: In the a€oelow stagea€D of 
state development, property in its form of the extraction of resources is closely tied
to the power to say what the law is and will bea€”to jurisdiction directly, to legislation, or to 
the choice of magistrates. But just as the modern market economy makes everyone
formally equal in their economic rights, so the a€oehighest stagea€D statea€”the democratic 
republica€” makes everyone formally equal in their political rights:

Further, in most historical states the rights conceded to citizens are graded on a property basis, 
whereby it is directly admitted that the state is an
organization for the protection of the possessing class.... This political recognition of property 
differences. marks a low stage in the development of the

state. The highest form of the state, the democratic republic, which in our modern social 
conditions becomes more and more an unavoidable necessity and
is the form of state in which alone the last decisive battle between proletariat and bourgeoisie. 
no longer officially recognizes differences of property.

But in Engel sa€™ s eyes formal equality is in fact the opposite of substantive equality, because 
of simple corruption and, indirectly, a€oeby an alliance between the government and
the stock exchangea€D:

Wealth here employs its power indirectly, but all the more surely. It does this... by plain 
corruption of officials. and by an alliance between the government

and the stock exchange, which is effected all the more easily the higher the state debt mounts and 
the more the joint-stock companies concentrate in their
hands not only transport but also production itselfa€!. In addition to America, the latest French 
republic illustrates this strikingly, and honest little
Switzerland has also given a creditable performance in this field.

And the control of the government by the stock exchange is not limited to democratic republics:

But that a democratic republic is not essential to this brotherly bond between government and stock 
exchange is proved not only by England, but also by
the new German Empire, where it is difficult to say who scored most by the introduction of 
universal suffrage, Bismarck or the BleichrAJder bank.

It is, however, not completely clear to me what Engels is pointing to as this a€oealliance between 
the government and the stock exchangea€D. Today it is very clear: in the public
sphere the governments™ s performance is scored by the media and by the well-thinking by whether 
stocks go up or not. But this was not true, or not true to the same degree, back
in 1884.

Finally, Engels needs to reassure the faithful, and to say that, in spite of what he sees around 
him, eventually the New Jerusalem will descend from the Heavens, adorned like a
bride:

The oppressed class... the proletariat... in the measure in which it matures towards its 
self-emancipation... constitutes itself as its own party and votes for its
own representatives, not those of the capitalists. On the day when the thermometer of universal 
suffrage shows boiling-point among the workers, they as

well as the capitalists will know where they standaCI

Ray Gingera€™ s personal story is a very interesting and tragic onea€”a historian of enormous 
capabilities, insight, and promise, whose career and lifea€™ s work was severely
crippled by his falling victim to McCarthyism. Born in 1924, he went to college, got drafted, in 
the closing days of World War II joined the American Communist Party, went to
graduate school at what is now Case Western Reserve, and in 1949 published his dissertation, the 
definitive biography of Eugene V. Debs: Ray Ginger, The Bending Cross: A
Biography  of Eugene V. Debs (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1949 
<https://archive.org/details/bendingcrossbiogOOgingrich/>, that then won him a job at Harvard
Business School as editor of the Business History Review. But then in 1954 the U.S. House Committee 
on Unamerican Activities came knocking. Harvard fired him when he would
not sign an oath declaring that he was not a member of the Communist Party, and would only pay him 
his final two weeksa€™ salary if he, his wife, and their newborn left the state
immediately.

The stress broke his marriage. He worked in the second half of the 1950s in advertising and as a 
book editor, during those years writing two great books, Altgelda€™ s America
about turn-of-the-1900s-Chicago, and Six Days or Forever? about the Tennessee Scopes monkey trial. 
In 1960, Brandeis University hired him as an assistant professor. They
promoted and tenured him. His students later endowed Brandeisa€™ s Ray Ginger Chair in History.

He left Brandeis in 1966 to become a visiting professor at Stanford. Universitiesa€”Wayne State, 
Calgary a€’’would hire him with tenure. He died of alcoholism in Boston in 1975.
All of his books are very much worth reading.
