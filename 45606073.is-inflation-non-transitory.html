That means, above all, that the long-run inflation target is too low to maintain macroeconomic balance. The Federal Reserve should already have thought about this and take an action to raise the inflation target.</p><p>The second thing to say is that the overwhelming bulk of the inflation we are right now seeing must be transitory if such a small increase in interest rates will be sufficient to return the economy to its 2 1/2% per year long-run inflation target. This is, as I say over and over again, not a 1970s like inflationary spiral—not melting the engine—but rather leaving rubber on the road as you rejoin the highway traffic at speed. Rejoining the highway traffic at speed is a good thing to do. Leaving rubber on the road is a necessary consequence of doing that. It’s stupid to complain about it.</p><p>The third thing to say is that restoring an economy to full employment while undertaking a massive structural shift in an economy with sticky downward wages (and some prices) has always, in our experience, been accompanied by a transitory burst of inflation. You have to incentivize movement into the sectors that need to expand by creating price differentials vis-a-vis the contracting sectors. And with their wages (and some of their prices) downward-sticky, that is a transitory burst of inflation. It is the post World War II demobilization and the Korean war era mobilization from the Cold War that should serve as are examples, if indeed there are any examples that are relevant. Those who look at the US post-Korean War experience and try to generalize from that are, I think, barking up the wrong tree:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Robert Armstrong &amp; Ethan Wu</strong>: <em>The Fed Still Thinks Inflation Is Transitory</em>: ‘The most surprising thing in the Fed’s sedate December meeting was the news… that monetary policy committee members project three interest rate increases next year, rather than the two that consensus had called for. Even this spooked no one…. The Fed is acknowledging short rates will need to rise somewhat to hedge against persistent inflation. That is evident in the 2022 and 2023 dots. But the median forecast for rates in 2024 nudged up only a bit, from 1.75 percent to just over 2 percent. The longer-run dots have stayed the same…. The committee thinks, with a high level of unanimity, that a short raising cycle, topping out at 2.5 percent, will ensure that inflation is transitory…. Above target inflation will last about a year. Everybody, say it together now: <em><strong>transitory!</strong></em> The Fed retired the word, but it still thinks the same way…. The bond market wholeheartedly agrees with the Fed’s attitude…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a

Paxlovid, a small molecule that is orally active, was specifically designed to tackle SARS-CoV–2…. It binds to the virus’s main protease (Mpro)…. Inhibiting Mpro is a choke point for the virus, making it unable to replicate…. It’s going to be a blister pack for 5-days. Twice a day: Two 150 mg tablets of Paxlovid, and One 100 mg of Ritonavir. That’s right. Paxlovid isn’t given alone. It is accompanied by low dose Ritonavir, another viral protease inhibitor used for HIV, but being used here to increase the blood levels of Paxlovid without any antiviral effect itself. This works through a cytochrome (3A4) that is in common with the metabolism of many frequently used drugs such as statins and certain blood thinners, so a temporary 5-day off such drugs, or adjustment of their doses may be appropriate or necessary…. Paxlovid is a breakthrough, and I don’t use that term lightly. It not only provides a new layer of defense, but a unique one that is not dependent on our immune system and not affected by Omicron or other variants…. We need it out there in large quantities ASAP…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:45544642,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://erictopol.substack.com/p/why-paxlovid-is-a-just-in-time-breakthrough&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:587835,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Ground Truths&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/149c43b6-bca5-4743-9e1e-1e5095eefe79_508x508.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Why Paxlovid is a Just-in-Time Breakthrough&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;We’re desperately in need of some good news—this is it.

It’s really important to me at this point to be with my loved ones and to celebrate things. It’s important to me to minimize risk of COVID, but I’m assuming exposure is likely over the next few weeks and I’m not operating in a way that will completely eradicate that risk; I think for my family, we can’t do that without completely canceling any indoor gathering, and we aren’t going to do that…. The risk of serious illness or long COVID as present but low for the people I’m personally responsible for, given those circumstances. So practically… I’m socializing in homes and spaces that require vaccines…. For a gathering over 2 families at a time, I’m asking people to rapid-test immediately prior…. We are reconsidering spending a few days away in a place where we’d likely be eating indoors around people who aren’t vaxxed—I suspect we won’t go, but we have a few days to decide…. You do not necessarily have to lock down. You have to be thoughtful and careful… doing your part to flatten the curve and to be a good neighbor…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/rachaelbedard/status/1471568119286140935&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;I’m getting a lot of texts and questions about what to do rn about holiday plans.
