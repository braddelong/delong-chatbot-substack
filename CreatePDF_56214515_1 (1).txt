Paragraphs

The gap in social power between members of the A©lite and the masses of the people was greater in 
Europe than in China. As a broad generalization, that might well be true: access to the levers of 
any of military, bureaucratic, or clerical power in Europe typically gave you powers of domination 
that were very difficult to resist; but even a poor person in China would have a clan network that 
they could use as a source of social power vis-A -vis any single
command from a member of the A©lite. The gap in social power between the state and the A©lite was 
greater in China than in Europe. As a broad generalization, that also might well be true. But what 
we are hunting is how social and cultural patterns durably alter the long run incentives for, in 
BaumolS™ s words, positive-sum rather than negative-sum "entrepreneurshipa€D. And that seems to 
meto depend much more on what is going on at the margins:

Ruixue Jia, GA©rard Roland, & Yang Xie: A Theory of Power Structure & Institutional Compatibility: 
China vs. Europe Revisited'. S~The literature on institutions and development contrasts inclusive 
societies with extractive ones, while the scholarship comparing Imperial China and Premodern Europe 
defies this dichotomy. To reconcile these views, we model the institutional differences between the 
two societies along two
dimensions of their power structure: the RulerS™ s absolute power was weaker in Europe, whereas the 
EliteS“People relationship in terms of their power and rights was more balanced in China. Our model 
shows that a more balanced EliteS“People relationship can be compatible with a more absolutist 
Ruler. The model also helps interpret differences in specific institutions and autocratic 
stabilityS!

And so the key question becomes: why were "European" powers willing to fight each other over there 
imperial interests in the near-peripheryS”in the Balkans and the Middle EastS’’while they were not 
willing to fight each other over imperial interests in Africa or Asia? There was, as Bismarck said, 
Soenothing in the Balkans worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadierSd:

Dominic Lieven: The End of Tsarist Russia: The March to World War I & Revolution'. S~Russian 
ambitions at Constantinople and the Straits have to be seen within the context of an imperialist 
age, in which the British took over Egypt to secure their hold on the Suez Canal and the Americans 
seized the Isthmus of Panama in order to control the key strategic and commercial highway between 
the Atlantic and the Pacific. As we shall see,
the Straits on balance mattered more to Russia than even Suez or Panama did to the British or the 
AmericansS!

Just how much of a crackpot den StanfordS™ s Hoover Institution isS”that is something that it is 
difficult for outsiders to grasp. Richard EpsteinS™ s insistence on a€cerespecta€D for his claim 
that COVID-19 was highly likely to kill less than 500 people in the United States is only one 
example:

Isaac Chotiner & Richard Epstein: The Contrarian Coronavirus Theory That Informed the Trump 
Administration'. S~Richard, with all due respect, your article is apparently circulating in 
conservative circles in Washington and the White House. I didna€™t write it as a conservative 
article. Donald Trumpa€™s name is not mentioned in it. I grasped that. Ia€™m not interested in 
politics.S! I know, but these are scientific
issues here. You know nothing about the subject but are so confident that youa€™re going to say 
that Ia€™m a crackpot. No. RichardS” Thata€™s what youa€™re saying, isna€™t it? Thata€™s what 
youa€™re saying? IS™ m not saying anything of the sort. Admit to it. Youa€™re saying Ia€™m a 
crackpot. IS™ m not saying anything of theS” Well, what am I then? Ia€™m an amateur? Youa€™re the
great scholar on this? No, no. IS™ m not a great scholar on this. Tell me what you think about the 
quality of the work! O.K. IS™ m going to tell you. I think the fact that I am not a great scholar 
on this and IS™ m able to find these flaws or these holes in what you wrote is a sign that maybe 
you shouldS™ ve thought harder before writing it. What it shows is that you are a complete 
intellectual amateur. Period. O.K. Can I ask
you one more question? You just dona€™t know anything about anything. Youa€™re a journalist. Would 
you like to compare your rA©sumA© to mine? No, actually, I would not. Then good. Then maybe what 
you want to do is to say, SoeGee, Ia€™m not quite sure that this is right. Ia€™m going to check 
with somebody else.a€D But, you want to come at me hard, I am going to come back harder at you. And
then if I cana€™t jam my fingers down your throat, then I am not worth it. But you have basically 
gone over the line. If you want to ask questions, ask questions. I put forward a model. But a 
little bit of respectS!
