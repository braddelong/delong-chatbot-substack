So I got a phone call from someone at the policy school: would I come to their class on budgeting 
and give my take on the federal budget. a€ceSurea€D, I thought, a€oecollegiality is a good thing. 
Plus I did this before, the last time being twoa€! three?a€! years ago, back when John Ellwood was 
teaching this course. I will simply dust off my notes, update them, and give my takea€”all the 
while stressing that this is education-for-citizenship so that the students
can fulfill their role as voters, rather than any tools or insights that will be useful in their 
day jobs.a€D

Then came the a€oeULP! !a€D moment. I discovered that it had not been two or three years, but 
rather six since I had last given: Budgeting & Macro Policy: A Primer 
<https://github.eom/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/2015-02-23-budgeting-%26-macro-primer.pdf>. 
And I discovered that my thoughts had changed considerably since 2015, as the situation had changed 
and as, yes, my judgments of how the world works with respect to the entire
government budget had changed as well.

So now I have a whole new, different talk to write up, for which I only have slides at 
<https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/budgeting-%26-macro-policy-TICKLER-pptx>, 
and copied below. They do not make very good notes for reconstructing the argument I made:

An Equation Only a True Economist
Could Love

Equation (A.36) from J. Bradford DeLong and Lawrence H. Summers, “Fiscal Policy in a Depressed 
Economy”, in the spring 2012 volume of
the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity. See?


Change in the present value
of future GDP induced by $1
of ex government purchases
today

Labor-side
employment
hysteresis

Short-run Keynesian

Only a real economist would ever write something like this, or assert that it is simplified, 
streamlined, and easily comprehensible.

The Four Targets and the Three "Runs"

The government’s budgetary policy—its deficit (or surplus)—affects the macroeconomy in
three “runs”.

1.   In the short run, a government deficit can serve as a valuable tool to rebalance the
economy in a depression if interest rates are very very low.

2.   In the medium run, a government surplus crowds in investment and boosts the rate
of growth.

3.   And in the long run a government that does not or cannot pay its bills gets into a
world of hurt.

And the government’s budgetary policy primarily affects societal well-being through its
effects on four important macroeconomic quantities:

1.  The unemployment rate.

2.  The closely-related level of employment.

3.  The rate of inflation.

4.  The rate of economic growth
5.
