What followed is both disturbing and depressingly familiar. A complaint was filed, the presentation was characterized by senior administrators as “undeniably” Islamophobic, and the lecturer (who did not have the protections of tenure) was fired.

The fear was that some believers would then take such images, and treat them like icons—as holy and sacred things to be venerated. This would be bad: veneration and worship should be solely of the Almighty, the Merciful, the Compassionate. For, as Abu Bakr said upon announcing the death of the Prophet:</p><blockquote><p>Whoever among you worships Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him): Muhammad has died. Whoever worships God: God is alive, and cannot die…</p></blockquote><p>It seems to me that these days very very few indeed are in any danger of falling into error by turning a picture of Muhammed into an icon to be venerated. </p><p>The danger seems to lie on the other side—to fall into error by ascribing a God-like transcendental holiness to Muhammed’s face, in the sense that we see in Exodus 33:</p><blockquote><p>And [the Lord] said, “Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.” And the Lord said, “Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen”...</p></blockquote><p>Rajiv Sethi recommends:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Christiane Gruber: </strong><a href="https://newlinesmag.com/argument/academic-is-fired-over-a-medieval-painting-of-the-prophet-muhammad/">An Academic Is Fired Over a Medieval Painting of the Prophet Muhammad</a>: ‘The dismissal of an instructor at Hamline University on baseless charges of 'Islamophobia' raises concerns about freedom on campus…</p></li><li><p><strong>Amna Khalid: </strong><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/most-of-all-i-am-offended-as-a-muslim?cid=gen_sign_in">Most of All, I Am Offended as a Muslim</a>: ‘On Hamline University’s shocking imposition of narrow religious orthodoxy in the classroom…</p></li><li><p><strong>Mark Ber</strong>k<strong>son: </strong><a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2022/12/26/hamline-university-apparently-fires-art-history-lecturer-for-showing-depictions-of-muhammed/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Letter to the “Oracle”</a>…</p></li></ul><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/creeping-academic-idiocyacademic?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/creeping-academic-idiocyacademic?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>MUST-READ: <strong>Les Mis Daily:</strong></h2><p>A nice way to use SubStack:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Victor Hugo</strong> (1862): <a href="https://lesmisletters.substack.com/p/les-mis-daily-preface?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Les Mis Daily - Preface</a>: ‘So long as there shall exist, by virtue of law and custom, decrees of damnation pronounced by society, artificially creating hells amid the civilization of earth, and adding the element of human fate to divine destiny; so long as the three great problems of the century—the degradation of man through pauperism, the corruption of woman through hunger, the crippling of children through lack of light—are unsolved; so long as social asphyxia is possible in any part of the world;—in other words, and with a still wider significance, so long as ignorance and poverty exist on earth, books of the nature of Les Misérables cannot fail to be of use.

Ober finds contemporary echoes of this tradition in the application of game theory to political science, economics, and business management.&nbsp;<em>The Greeks and the Rational</em>&nbsp;offers a striking revisionist history with widespread implications for the study of ancient Greek civilization, the history of thought, and human rationality itself…</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://overcast.fm/+s3EsH6lDk">https://overcast.fm/+s3EsH6lDk</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Very Briefly Noted:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Noah Smith</strong>: <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-third-magic?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">The third magic: A meditation on history, science, and AI</a>…</p></li><li><p><strong>Olivier Blanchard: </strong><em>Fiscal Policy under Low Interest Rates</em>…</p></li><li><p><strong>Paul Krugman</strong>: ‘<a href="https://mastodon.online/@pkrugman/109615335847049186">In the end</a>, it all comes down to individual motives and decisions.

Liberals, like conservatives, know what there is to fear: the fatal cycle that begins with revolutionary enthusiasm and expectation, slipping into violence justified in the name of a better world, followed by civil war, dissolution of the state, and the authoritarian reassertion of control…. In any competitive democratic system, the temptation to treat an adversary as an enemy is unavoidable…. Democracy’s informal rules of engagement might best be described as a code of hypocritical civility…. Smart adversaries keep the contest clean to keep it under control…. Once elections are concluded, competitive passions are usually spent, and tried and tested forms of decorum resume their pacifying role….
