FIRST: My Unpublished Review of Eric Hobsbawma€™s The Age of Extremes

From early 1995. People have been asking me why I am not especially enamored of Eric Hobsbawm: The 
Age of Extremes <https: //archive .org/details/ageofextremeshisOOhobs_Q>.

Hobsbawm was, of course, the pre-eminent Marxist historian of the late-20th century. Born in 
Alexandria, the son of a middle-class Jewish Polish Briton and a Jewish Austrian, he grew up in 
Vienna and Berlin before fleeing Hitler with his family to Britain in 1933 at the age of sixteen, 
and then becoming an academic superstar at Cambridge before the a€oesoft McCarthyisma€D of 
post-WWII Britain set in. But his influence on how e very onea€’’Marxist and
non-Marxist alikea€’’viewed the economic history of the Industrial Revolution century was and is 
immense.

My title was David Landesa€™ s idea. My overall view is that up until 1870 Hobsbawm is brilliant, 
if often wrong in the extent to which his relatively orthodox Marxism closes his mind. But even 
when his mind is closed, his wrongness is a powerful and stimulating irritant to thought. After 
1870, however, his relatively orthodox Marxism keeps him from being able to even see much of what 
is in front of his face, and that becomes worse as he moves closer to
the present, and what is in front of his face is very awkward not just for the movement he 
committed himself to, but for his own assessment of himself as a man.

My closing:

Brad DeLong: Low Marx: Eric Hobsbawma€™ s a€oeAge of Extreme sa€\3 Eric Hobsbawm might complain 
that I have been unfair: that my real gripe is that I wish that he had written another, different 
book. He might say that I want a Book Written for the Ages, that reflects what historians in future 
centuries will find of greatest interest. And he is right, I do. By contrast, he might say, his 
book is a€oewritten by a twentieth-century writer for late-twentieth-
century readers,a€D to whom a€oethe history of the confrontation between capitalism and 
socialisma€! social revolutions, the Cold War, the nature, limits, and fatal flaws of 'really 
existing socialisma€™ and its breakdowna€O are worth discussing at length. He is writing for 
readers who take the central theme of twentieth-century history to be the tragical-heroic course of 
World Communism.

But the tragical-heroic course of World Communism is simply not the central theme of 20th-century 
history.

And so for what audience is Hobsbawm writing his book? To what a€oelate 20th-century readersa€D can 
we recommend The Age of Extremes, as covering the pieces of 20th-century history they want and need 
to learn?

finding an answer to the question of how as keen-eyed an analyst as Eric Hobsbawm can have held 
both these beliefsa€’’without apparent straina€”for more than forty years. Yet Hobsbawma€™ s book 
is constructed as if he wants to make it as hard as possible for a new student to figure out that 
this is an important question to ask.

2. For informed and experienced students seeking an overview of how the twentieth century changed 
the world, its focus is awry. Forty percent of space on the rise and fall world religion of 
Communism, and ten percent on the rise and growth of social democracy with its triple 
successesa€”material prosperity, political democracy, and successful creation of middle-class 
societiesa€”is the wrong balance. Ten percent on the world religion of
Communism and forty percent on social democracy would be infinitely preferable

3. For students of Communism who believe that on balance ita€”a social movement that has, after 
all, contributed two of the twentieth centurya€™ s three members of the I-killed-thirty-million 
club (Hitler, Mao, and Stalin), and at least four members of the I-killed-one-million club (Kim II 
Sung, Pol Pot, Vladimir Lenin, Mengistu)a€”was not one of the brighter lights on humanitya€™ s tree 
of good ideas, the book will be profitable. But it will be
profitable as an index of the impact decades of doublethink can leave on a good mind, as well as as 
an interpretation of history.

How many potential readers are left?

.html>

Writing today, in mid-2022, and looking back at this from 27 years later, one point strikes me as 
of especial interest. It is that my review hints at how much different my forthcoming Slouching 
Towards Utopia <bit.ly/3pP3Krk> would have been had a written it in the late 1990s and published it 
as the history of the long 20th century 1870-2000. That would've been much more of a 
triumphalist-left-neoliberal book:

• The explosion of technology at its deployment starting in 1870a€!

• Creating the possibility of grasping utopiaaC!

• But also requiring the reinvention of institutions for production, organization, distribution, 
and utilization every generational

•  A process of necessary reinvention that stress societies to the max and caused great misery and 
destructiona€!

•  But humanity finally got it almost right with the 1945 creation of social democracy in the 
Atlantic west and the 1989 fall of really existing Socialism in the Eurasian heartlandsa€!

•  And then the fending-off in the 1990s of the rate the liberal reactionary clock turning back 
challenge gives us great hope for the futurea€!

Now from todaya€™ s perspective, you can laugh at even the implicit portrayal of Bill Clinton and 
Tony Blair as the leading-edge self-consciousness of the World Spirit at the End of History. But 
there were possibilities in the mid-1990s that we might have been able to grasp. And perhaps George 
W. Busha€™ s election a€ce victory a€D by his 5-4 vote of the only voters who really counted was a 
decisive and destructive hinge of history. Certainly our world
climate thinks so.

As for my major complaints about Hobsbawm, I still think that (1) is dead-on. It is a fact that in 
the age of extremes the history of what was going on behind the Iron and Bamboo curtains is 
re-counted twice. First, in its proper place in the chronological sequence of the book, Hobsbawm 
presents what he thought and wished was going on. Then, later in the book, out of chronological 
sequence, he has relatively short sections on what was actually going on. And he
does this twice: once for Stalin, and once for Mao. Given that he devotes about 40% of his book to 
the trajectory of really-existing socialism, this makes it very confusing as an introduction to 
20th-century history, and thus unsuitable as the first book anybody reads.

I also think (2) is dead-on: the rise and fall of really-existing socialism and it's roll in the 
first defeat of fascism are important themes of 20th-century history, but they are not the main 
event.

And as for (3)a€”well, understanding the self-delusions of the Communists of the interwar and 
post-WWII perioda€’’those whose Kronstadt-moments never came, or came only when the Kosygin 
economic-reform wing of the CPUSSR was outweighed by the Brezhnev third-world-adventurist wing in 
the 1970s (rather than coming when they should have, with the December 1917 dissolution of the 
Constituent Assembly)a€”that seems to be a matter only for
specialists right now. For we have many others whose destructive and demented self-delusions cry 
out for understanding and action today.

So, no, I do not think there is a mass audience of 21st-century readers for whom The Age of 
Extremes is worth their time. And that is too bad, for there are a lot of good individual pages in 
that book, but its flawed architecture is just too great a hobble.

Allison Shertzer @econhist allday

The AEA is now recommending that all interviews be held virtually for the New Orleans meetings, 
both due to covid and to "promote equity." I think this is a reasonable compromise on all fronts 
and I'm grateful to the organization for providing this guidance.

Interviews

The AEA recommends that employers conduct initial interviews starting on Monday, January 2,2023, 
and strongly recommends that all
interviews take place virtually (eg by Zoom) We suggest that interviews not take place during the 
AEA meeting itself (January 6-8,2023).

Rationale: In the past interviews were conducted in person at the AEA/ASSA meetings This promoted 
thickness of the market, because most
candidates and employers were present at the in-person meetings, but had the disadvantage of 
precluding both job candidates and interviewers
from                                                                     fully participating in 
AEA/ASSA sessions

interviews should now be conducted virtually to prevent risk of exposure to COVID. and to promote 
equity among the candidates informal
feedback to the AEA committee on the job market indicated that the benefits of virtual first-round 
interviews (eg. low monetary cost, zero cost
in                                                                    travel time, convenience) 
outweighed the limitations (eg less rich interaction).

Paragraphs:

Joel Mokyr writes a very nice review of the excellent Rubin and Koyama chttps: //ww 
w.howtheworldbecamerich ,com/home>.

But, reaching the end of his review, I thought: Wait a minute: a€oewhile Atlantic ports have been 
shown to have been crucial for subsequent economic development (Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson, 
2005), the exact causal chains are still uncleara€D? But one very clear causal chain is that 
Britain's Atlantic ports grew filthy rich off of the profits of the triangle trade, and that they 
used this wealth to give them additional political voice in favor of a commerce-
and industry-friendly institutional order. A second clear causal chain is the higher wages in 
Britain in large part produced by Britain's Atlantic Empire spurred innovation in labor-saving 
machinery and devices. A third is that Britain's population after 1700 could get slave-grown sugar 
calories for 1/3 of the resource cost of other marginal calories. A fourth is that Britain after 
1800 could get slave-grown cotton from America for 1/2 the resource cost of marginal
Indian or Egyptian cotton. Were any of these decisive, in the sense that its lack would have left 
us today in a counterfactual poor gunpowder-empire or perhaps early-steampunk world? Almost surely 
not. Were all of these together decisive in the same counterfactual sense? Probably not, but 
perhaps. Is all of the a€oenew history of capitalisma€D work solid and sound? No. Is it 
interesting? Yes.

But it is simply wrong to say that a€oethe famous thesis by Eric Williamsa€! cannot be seriously 
defendeda€U. The "cannot" requires that you yourself be certain that you have nailed down the 
process by which northwest Europe alone and no previous society underwent the transition to modern 
economic growth. And I do not think anybody should be certain they have the process nailed down:

Joel Mokyr: How the World Became Rich: The Historical Origins of Economic Growth: a€~The book is a 
wide-ranging yet remarkably complete and accessible survey of the Great Enrichment, the emergence 
of modern and prosperous economies that provide us with a material standard of living that our 
ancestors could not have dreamed of. How and why modern economic growth occurred when and where it 
did, and how economists
have tried to understand this phenomenon, is the themea€!. The ecumenical and balanced approach the 
authors take to these questions is much like the Rabbia€! holding court in front of a large 
audience of his pupils. A husband and wife appeara€!. The Rabbi listens carefully and pronounces 
his verdict: the husband is in the right. Then his pupils appeal to him: you should hear the 
wifea€™ s case as well. The Rabbi consents and listens
to the woman lays out her powerful case against her lazy and violent husband. He then announces his 
second verdict: the wife is in the right. His best pupil protests: but Rabbi, how can they both be 
in the right? The Rabbi listens and pronounces: the pupil is right tooa€!. The one issue on which 
the book takes a relatively strong position is on the issue of European imperialism and the 
importance of slavery and the slave trade to the
Industrial Revolution and the origins of Western technological leadership (chapter 6). In recent 
years the a€oenew history of capitalism,a€D in its zeal to blame the West and Capitalism for all 
the ills of the world, has argued that the West grew rich largely at the expense of the Africans 
and Asians whom Europeans mercilessly enslaved, sold, and exploited. As more sophisticated and 
economically literate scholarship has shown, the
famous  thesis by Eric Williams and recent proponents (e.g., Berg and Hudson, 2021) that somehow 
the Industrial Revolution depended on European imperialism and the Atlantic slave trade cannot be 
seriously defended. While Atlantic ports have been shown to have been crucial for subsequent 
economic development (Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson, 2005), the exact causal chains are still 
unclear, and Koyama and Rubin stress
sensibly  that without institutional support for technological progress, without a rule of law and 
constraints on the executive, and without a comparatively inclusive society, no amount of 
colonialism and oppression of non-Europeans would have triggered modern economic growtha€!

<https://eh.net/book_reviews/how-the-world-became-rich-the-historical-origins-of-economic-growth/>

This seems to me to be a good immediate reaction. But what to do in the future? I would suggest 
requiring that governments of the Handmaid Statesa€”if they want AS S A businessa€’’purchase 
insurance policies so that anyone with a reproductive health issue can be immediate airlifted out 
to someplace where doctors are, you know, not legally prohibited from doing their job:

Allison Shertzer: a€~The AEA is now recommending that all interviews be held virtually for the New 
Orleans meetings, both due to covid and to a€oepromote equity.a€D I think this is a reasonable 
compromise on all fronts and Ia€™ m grateful to the organization for providing this guidance. There 
are already credible reports of women with pregnancy complications facing barriers to care in Texas 
and Louisiana. These delays are a very
predictable result of threatening doctors with prison if they perform a medical abortion that is 
later deemed unnecessary. Moving the meetings would have been incredibly costly, and Ia€™ m 
relieved there is a compromise that preserves the AEAa€™ s finances without requiring pregnant 
women to travel to New Orleans in order to get (or fill) a joba€!

Three Chinasa€”the Spain-level 60-million megacity growth poles, which also possess the worlda€™ s

generation. (4) China[a€™ s amazing] accomplish[ment]a€! was not at all easy. Other countries that

nothing to learn from the United Statesa€!. The purpose of our export machine is to attain 
technological parity. And after that, our societal superiority will lead

to technological supremacy. And after that, the CCP will lead humanity forward into the sunlit 
uplands of utopia. What form will a€oeutopiaa€D take in the eyes of Xi Jinping and his successors? 
Well, they are certain that the CCP can only be the vanguard of humanity if the CCP is more than a 
bunch of corrupt bureaucrats uneasily sitting atop the pyramid of society. So: (1) Use propaganda 
to create centralized campaigns of inspiration.

(2) Recall the CCP to its egalitarian, utopian origins. (3) Repress those who seek to remove the 
CCP from its vanguard rolea€”that way lies decadence and incompetence, like the United States 
today. The problem is that the CCP is, increasingly, a bunch of corrupt bureaucrats uneasily 
sitting atop the pyramid of society. So I really cannot see how it could end wella€!

Hobsbawm: Brief Tastes

A brief taste of my favorite (even if wrong in taking Britain as the model for economic and France 
for political revolution; and really wrong in its communist triumphalism) Hobsbawm:

1962: The Age of Revolution, 1789-1848'. a€~The history of the dual revolution is not merely one of 
the triumph of the new bourgeois society. It is also the history of the emergence of the forces 
which were, within a century of 1848, to have turned expansion into contraction. What is more, by 
1848 this extraordinary future reversal of fortunes was already to some extent visible. Admittedly, 
the world-wide revolt against the west, which
dominates the middle of the twentieth century, was as yet barely discerniblea€! [its] first 
stagesa€! within the Turkish empire in the 183os, and above all in the neglected and significant 
career of Mohammed Ali of Egypt. But within Europe the forces and ideas which envisaged the 
supersession of the triumphant new society, were already emerginga€! the 'spectre of communism'a€!.

If we look round the world of the 196os we shall not be tempted to underestimate the historic force 
of the revolutionary socialist and communist ideology born out of reaction against the dual 
revolutiona€!. The historic period which begins with the construction of the first factory system 
of the modern world in Lancashire and the French Revolution of 1789 ends with the construction of 
its first railway network and the publication of the

The Republican Attack on Citizenship

I wasna€™ t planning on doing a post today, but the column by my friend Jamelle Bouie in todaya€™ s 
New York Times compelled me to write something. The piece makes the profound and unnerving 
observation that therea€™ s been escalating rhetoric from Republicans that attacks the very 
citizenship of their political rivals. Jamelle writesa€!

Hobsbawm: Brief Tastes

A brief taste of my favorite (even if wrong in taking Britain as the model for economic and France 
for political revolution; and really wrong in its communist triumphalism) Hobsbawm:

1962: The Age of Revolution, 1789-1848'. a€~The history of the dual revolution is not merely one of 
the triumph of the new bourgeois society. It is also the history of the emergence of the forces 
which were, within a century of 1848, to have turned expansion into contraction. What is more, by 
1848 this extraordinary future reversal of fortunes was already to some extent visible. Admittedly, 
the world-wide revolt against the west, which
dominates the middle of the twentieth century, was as yet barely discerniblea€! [its] first 
stagesa€! within the Turkish empire in the 183os, and above all in the neglected and significant 
career of Mohammed Ali of Egypt. But within Europe the forces and ideas which envisaged the 
supersession of the triumphant new society, were already emerginga€! the 'spectre of communism'a€!.

If we look round the world of the 196os we shall not be tempted to underestimate the historic force 
of the revolutionary socialist and communist ideology born out of reaction against the dual 
revolutiona€!. The historic period which begins with the construction of the first factory system 
of the modern world in Lancashire and the French Revolution of 1789 ends with the construction of 
its first railway network and the publication of the
Communist Manifestoa€!
