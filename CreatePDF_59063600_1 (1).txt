SLOUCHING TOWARDS UTOPIA

PREORDER NOW • ON SALE 6 SEPTEMBER

AJ 5&6: What follows is my grand narrative, my version of what is the most important story to tell 
of the history of the twentieth century. It is a primarily economic story. It naturally starts in 
1870.1 believe it naturally stops in 2010.

As the genius Dr. Jekyll-like Austro-English-Chicagoan moral philosopher Friedrich August von Hayek 
observed, the market economy crowdsourcesa€’’incentivizes and coordinates at the 
grassrootsa€’’solutions to the problems it sets.[5] [m] Back before 1870 humanity did not have the 
technologies or the organizations to allow a market economy to pose the problem of how to make the 
economy rich. So even though humanity had had market economies, or at
least market sectors within its economies, for thousands of years before 1870, all that markets 
could do was to find customers for producers of luxuries and conveniences, and make the lives of 
the rich luxurious and of the middle class convenient and comfortable.[n]
