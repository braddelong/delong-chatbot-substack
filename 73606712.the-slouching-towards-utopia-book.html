For example:</p><blockquote><p><strong>John Ashmore &amp; Brad DeLong</strong>: <a href="https://capx.co/the-capx-podcast-brad-delong-on-slouching-towards-utopia/">The CapX Podcast: Brad DeLong on Slouching Towards Utopia</a>: ‘In a world of relentless, high-velocity news, sometimes it pays to take a step back and look at the big picture. Our guest this week, the US economist Brad DeLong, does that with some aplomb in his new book ‘Slouching Towards Utopia’ &lt;<a href="http://bit.ly/3pP3Krk">bit.ly/3pP3Krk</a>&gt;, a sweeping survey of economic development from the late 19th century to the present day, and an attempt to work out how we’ve ended up in this period of roiling economic crises. As well as making a big argument about the nature of economic life in the long 20th century that started in 1870, Brad’s book is full of winning vignettes and works just as well as a piece of narrative history as an argument about economics…</p></blockquote><p>I continue to engage people on Twitter.

Brenner took great exception to my claim þt þe economies &amp; societies in þe circle wiþin 300 miles of þe English port of Dover over 1600 to 1870 had more in common wiþ þe gunpowder empires elsewhere in þe world over 1600 to 1870 and with pre-1600 societies than they had with post-1870 societies. This claim is not a hill I would necessarily die on, although I do consider it substantially more likely than not.<br><br>I see the breakout—the moment after which we were highly likely to be on track to something like our modern world—as taking place around 1870, with the coming of the Industrial Research Lab, the Modern Corporation, and full globalization. Those amp-up global technology growth more than four-fold and allow humanity to escape from its ensorcellment by the Devil of Malthus. Without the IRL, MC, &amp; G, it is more likely than not, I think, that we would today be in a very poor Malthusian steampunk world.<br><br>Brenner sees the hinge of history as coming in the 1500s and 1600s, with the transformation of the Dover Circle socieities from those of peasants, craftsmen, knights, and lords to societies of laborers, farmers, entrepreneurs, merchants, mercenaries, bureaucrats, and kings. It is those changes, Brenner thinks, that set us on the path to today.<br><br>Thus he sees the key as a transformation in the relations of production (and domination); while I see the key as the creation of a system to drive technological advance at a pace that revolutionizes the forces of production every generation, and then revolutionizes them again.<br><br>In a way, this conflict springs from a tension inherent in the relationship between Freddie from Barmen and Charlie from Trier, with Freddie focusing much more on industrial technologies and Charlies focusing much more on the socio-economic order created by the bourgeoisie. While Marx was alive, this tension was submerged. Engels had his day job, after all, and worshipped his friend, who he saw as a genius on the level of Newton or Darwin. After Marx’s death, however, socialist elder Engels swings back toward the technological-determinist line that I take in my book, “Slouching Towards Utopia”, and that Brenner so vociferously objected to. &lt;<a href="https://bit.ly/3pP3Krk">bit.ly/3pP3Krk</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>Plus there are now some very nice critiques coming in. For example:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Jim Buhler: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/delong/status/1571207697269424128">Twitter</a>: ‘As an outsider who doesn’t know enough about the details of economic history to evaluate the choice, I can’t really say. But to me 2010 feels very arbitrary as an end point to the story DeLong tells. DeLonog wants to tell in fact seems to end effectively (and tragically) in the 1970s in the West with the inflation cycle and “legitimation crisis,” which for some reason was sufficient to bring the whole thing down…</p></blockquote><p>And so I reply: In this you agree with Tim Noah, who sees 1870-1980 as the Age of Social Democracy, which was then followed the an Age of Neoliberalism, Neofascism, &amp; of Authoritarian State Surveillance Capitalism with Egalitarian &amp; Utopian Aspirations.It depends on whether you see Social Democracy as the main protagonist, or the Polanyian-von Hayekian attempt to surf the waves of Schumpeterian creative destruction as the main narrative.</p><p>Read the whole thing:</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:73758996,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/jim-buhler-review-of-slouching-towards&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:47874,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Jim Buhler: Review of “Slouching Towards Utopia\&quot;&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Jim Buhler: Thread by @JimBuhler on Thread Reader App: ‘Last weekend, I read DeLong’s Slouching Toward Utopia <bit.ly/3pP3Krk>, an economic history of what he calls the long twentieth century (1870-2…&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-09-17T19:07:58.606Z&quot;,&quot;like_count&quot;:0,&quot;comment_count&quot;:0,&quot;bylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:16879,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Brad DeLong&quot;,&quot;previous_name&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ea5ae644-9822-4ca5-ac6b-e18c017d8fbc_1189x1208.png&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Author of Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the 20th Century (forthcoming Sep 06), sometime Deputy Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, old-school weblogger, UC Berkeley economic historian&quot;,&quot;profile_set_up_at&quot;:&quot;2021-04-22T17:45:51.845Z&quot;,&quot;publicationUsers&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:14551,&quot;user_id&quot;:16879,&quot;publication_id&quot;:47874,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;admin&quot;,&quot;public&quot;:true,&quot;is_primary&quot;:false,&quot;publication&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:47874,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;subdomain&quot;:&quot;braddelong&quot;,&quot;custom_domain&quot;:null,&quot;custom_domain_optional&quot;:false,&quot;hero_text&quot;:&quot;Economic history, economics, political economy, finance, &amp; forecasting.

Imagine <em>Sapiens</em>, but about the last 150 years of economic history, and actually good—that's what DeLong has accomplished in this sweeping account of economic growth during the industrial and information revolutions, and the political changes that accompanied them. DeLong is an excellent, clear, and unusually, very funny storyteller. Phrases like "multiverse", "snark", and "permanent Steampunk world" enliven his tale and make it more accessible, which focuses on individuals as well as ideas and statistics and sci-fi style counterfactuals. The chapters do get a little repetitive toward the end, and as DeLong admits, it's focused on the US. But those are minor dings on a very important book…</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>J.R.R. Tolkien</strong>: <em>Unfinished Tales &lt;</em><a href="https://archive.org/details/unfinishedtaleso0000tolk">https://archive.org/details/unfinishedtaleso0000tolk</a><em>&gt;</em>: “Long ago, ere Sauron deluded the smiths of Eregion, Galadriel came there, and she said to Celebrimbor, the chief of the Elven-smiths: ‘I am grieved in Middle-earth, for leaves fall and flowers fade that I have loved, so that the land of my dwelling is filled with regret that no Spring can redress.’ </p><p>‘How otherwise can it be for the Eldar, if they cling to Middle-earth?’ said Celebrimbor. ‘Will you then pass over Sea?’ </p><p>‘Nay,’ she said. ‘Angrod is gone, and Aegnor is gone, and Felagund is no more. Of Finarfin’s children I am the last. But my heart is still proud. What wrong did the golden house of Finarfin do that I should ask the pardon of the Valar, or be content with an isle in the sea whose native land was Aman the Blessed? Here I am mightier.’ </p><p>‘What would you then?’ said Celebrimbor. </p><p>‘I would have trees and grass about me that do not die – here in the land that is mine,’ she answered. ‘What has become of the skill of the Eldar?’ </p><p>And Celebrimbor said: ‘Where now is the Stone of Eärendil? And Enerdhil who made it is gone.’ </p><p>‘They have passed over Sea,’ said Galadriel, ‘with almost all fair things else. But must then Middle-earth fade and perish for ever?’ </p><p>‘That is its fate, I deem,’ said Celebrimbor. ‘But you know that I love you (though you turned to Celeborn of the Trees), and for that love I will do what I can, if haply by my art your grief can be lessened.’ </p><p>But he did not say to Galadriel that he himself was of Gondolin long ago, and a friend of Enerdhil, though his friend in most things outrivalled him. Yet if Enerdhil had not been then Celebrimbor would have been more renowned. Therefore he took thought, and began a long and delicate labour, and so for Galadriel he made the greatest of his works (save the Three Rings only). And it is said that more subtle and clear was the green gem that he made than that of Enerdhil, but yet its light had less power. For whereas that of Enerdhil was lit by the Sun in its youth, already many years had passed ere Celebrimbor began his work, and nowhere in Middle-earth was the light as clear as it had been, for though Morgoth had been thrust out into the Void and could not enter again, his far shadow lay upon it. </p><p>Radiant nonetheless was the Elessar of Celebrimbor; and he set it within a great brooch of silver in the likeness of an eagle rising upon outspread wings. 21 Wielding the Elessar all things grew fair about Galadriel, until the coming of the Shadow to the Forest. But afterwards when Nenya, chief of the Three, 22 was sent to her by Celebrimbor, she needed it (as she thought) no more, and she gave it to Celebrían her daughter, and so it came to Arwen and to Aragorn who was called Elessar…</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 25% off a group subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48"><span>Get 25% off a group subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donate Subscriptions&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true"><span>Donate Subscriptions</span></a></p><div class="install-substack-app-embed"><img class="install-substack-app-embed-img" src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png"><div class="install-substack-app-embed-text"><div class="install-substack-app-header">Read Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality in the Substack app</div><div class="install-substack-app-text">Available for iOS and Android</div></div><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_context=author-post-insert" target="_blank" class="install-substack-app-embed-link"><button class="install-substack-app-embed-btn button primary">Get the app</button></a></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>
