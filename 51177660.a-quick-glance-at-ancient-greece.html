And that was only the appetizer. Thereafter, following in the wake of the armies of Alexander the Great, and then the expansion of the Roman Empire to the Danube River, Greeks colonized city after city and spread out into the countryside from the Al-Fayyum oasis in Egypt to the Punjab, and from Alexandria Eschate near modern-day Tashkent to Marseilles in France. </p><p>Alongside the extraordinary growth of the Greek population is a remarkable increase in the average age of death among adults. There appears to be much less violence inflicted upon adults—either through violence directly applied, or through violence depriving adults of the resources that they need to keep living.</p><p>What do I mean by “less violence”? Consider what Odysseus says about what he did <em>after</em> the Trojan War was over, immediately after he and the twelve ships of Ithaka departed the shore:</p><blockquote><div class="preformatted-block"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false"></label><pre class="text">What of my sailing, then, from Troy?
What of those years of rough adventure, weathered under Zeus?
The wind that carried west from Ilion 
brought me to Ísmaros, on the far shore, 
a strongpoint on the coast of the Kikonês.
I stormed that place and killed the men who fought. 

Plunder we took, and we enslaved the women, 
to make division, equal shares to all—
but on the spot I told them: ‘Back, and quickly!
Out to sea again!’ My men were mutinous, 
fools, on stores of wine. Sheep after sheep 
they butchered by the surf, and shambling cattle, 
feasting,—while fugitives went inland, running 
to call to arms the main force of Kikonês.
This was an army, trained to fight on horseback 
or, where the ground required, on foot. They came 
with dawn over that terrain like the leaves 
and blades of spring. So doom appeared to us, 
dark word of Zeus for us, our evil days.

My men stood up and made a fight of it
backed on the ships, with lances kept in play, 
from bright morning through the blaze of noon 
holding our beach, although so far outnumbered; 
but when the sun passed toward unyoking time, 
then the Akhaians, one by one, gave way.

Six benches were left empty in every ship 
that evening when we pulled away from death. 
And this new grief we bore with us to sea:
our precious lives we had, but not our friends. 
No ship made sail next day until some shipmate 
had raised a cry, three times, for each poor ghost 
unfleshed by the Kikonês on that field…</pre></div></blockquote><p>At the moment when he says this, Odysseus has just been washed up, a castaway, in the land of the Phaiakia. They ask him how he got there. And the story he tells them is that he is a pirate. It is, moreover, a pirate who keeps pirating. When Odysseus leaves Troy, he has just finished fighting the long and brutal Trojan War. He and his crew have their plunder from Troy. Yet the first thing they do is pirate. Plus they are rather stupid and undisciplined about pirating. In such an environment, is anybody going to save and invest a lot? Or, rather, is anybody going to save and invest in anything other than weapons and weapons training both to (a) make you and yours a hard and difficult target for the pirates, and (b) make yourself more effective when you go pirate? </p><p>The economy’s ratio of savings to depreciation s/δ&nbsp; is surely going to be low, depressing the population. We can feed this into our basic if over-complex theoretical model of an economy in Malthusian equilibrium:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05dfbe3f-ccb6-4038-9009-8967966bf494_1172x742.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05dfbe3f-ccb6-4038-9009-8967966bf494_1172x742.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05dfbe3f-ccb6-4038-9009-8967966bf494_1172x742.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05dfbe3f-ccb6-4038-9009-8967966bf494_1172x742.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05dfbe3f-ccb6-4038-9009-8967966bf494_1172x742.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/05dfbe3f-ccb6-4038-9009-8967966bf494_1172x742.png" width="1172" height="742" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/05dfbe3f-ccb6-4038-9009-8967966bf494_1172x742.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:742,&quot;width&quot;:1172,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;---econ-135-S2022_key.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="---econ-135-S2022_key.png" title="---econ-135-S2022_key.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05dfbe3f-ccb6-4038-9009-8967966bf494_1172x742.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05dfbe3f-ccb6-4038-9009-8967966bf494_1172x742.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05dfbe3f-ccb6-4038-9009-8967966bf494_1172x742.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05dfbe3f-ccb6-4038-9009-8967966bf494_1172x742.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Moreover, the risk that, as you mind your own business, Odysseus and company, well-trained, well-equipped, battle-hardened, will come along and, just because they can, “stormed that place and killed the men who fought.

A low population density means that the “Smithian” productivity gains from using those ideas to build an extensive and highly productive division of labor will be difficult to attain.</p><p>Yet from this Early Iron-Age Dark-Age beginning after the collapse of the high Mycenaean civilization of the Late Bronze Age, the Greek peoples built a civilization.</p><p>As Josiah Ober has written, the Greeks moved out of:</p><blockquote><p>the violence and gift-exchange economy that characterized what Finley (1965) famously called “the world of Odysseus”….&nbsp; There was in fact sustained and substantial growth in the Greek economy between the ages of Homer and of Plato and Aristotle… driven by (1) efficient methods of production, predicated on relative advantage and aimed at increasing the quantity as well the quality of goods produced, and (2) by market exchanges based on voluntary contracts. Moreover, the rational Greek state (notably, but not exclusively Athens) was increasingly cognizant—through its legislative, judicial, and administrative functions (ch. 5)—of the social (and taxable) value of providing rules and infrastructure aimed at facilitating the profitable production and exchange of goods…. Ancient Greeks, as individuals and collectives, frequently employed economic rationality, i.e. rationally instrumental reasoning in economic contexts….</p></blockquote><p>All-in-all, this appears to be a remarkable civilizational accomplishment, and not one limited to the enrichment of a luxurious predatory upper class. Houses got bigger—a lot bigger. Trade and the division of labor flourished. There is a reason that the Greeks have a predominant place in our cultural memory. That reason is not that they are "our" ancestors, whoever "we" happened to be. The people who decided that universities should study the Greeks lived on the island of Britain, in the upper Thames river valley near Oxford and in the fins of Norfolk near Cambridge. They were in nowise descendants, biologically or culturally, of the ancient Greeks. Nobody in England in 1450 could speak or read Greek. Yet the inhabitants of the valley and the fens adopted them as their predecessors in what they decided to call “western civilization”.</p><p>Emerging out of the Iron “Dark Age” of -1200 to -800, the Greeks built a unique institutional framework: the city-state. It emerged with functional systems of governance which provided public goods—security, boundary stones, marketplaces, mediators, dispute resolution. This initiated a period of sustained increases in living standards. How is that consistent with Malthusian equilibrium of any sort? Recall that in our model there are “luxuries”: commodities that enrich human flourishing but do not contribute to reproductive fitness, chief among which is a taste for living in cities, with a high taste for luxuries modeled by a large value of the coeffient <em>ɸ</em>. </p><p>A strong taste for luxuries gives us a high standard of living and level of productivity in Malthusian equilibrium. A high level of savings and investment gives us a high population density in Malthusian equilibrium.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d9a0a30-33a5-46d0-ae6d-d269c4d61ad8_1438x780.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d9a0a30-33a5-46d0-ae6d-d269c4d61ad8_1438x780.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d9a0a30-33a5-46d0-ae6d-d269c4d61ad8_1438x780.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d9a0a30-33a5-46d0-ae6d-d269c4d61ad8_1438x780.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d9a0a30-33a5-46d0-ae6d-d269c4d61ad8_1438x780.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2d9a0a30-33a5-46d0-ae6d-d269c4d61ad8_1438x780.png" width="1438" height="780" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2d9a0a30-33a5-46d0-ae6d-d269c4d61ad8_1438x780.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:780,&quot;width&quot;:1438,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:827980,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d9a0a30-33a5-46d0-ae6d-d269c4d61ad8_1438x780.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d9a0a30-33a5-46d0-ae6d-d269c4d61ad8_1438x780.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d9a0a30-33a5-46d0-ae6d-d269c4d61ad8_1438x780.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d9a0a30-33a5-46d0-ae6d-d269c4d61ad8_1438x780.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Now do not overstate the accomplishment. While Ancient Greece did have a period of democracy, it was relative short (less than 200 years) compared to the duration of the polities. Even during Greece’s Democratic Age, most <em>poleis</em> remained oligarchies. And remember! Most citizens—slaves, poor citizens who couldn’t afford their tax bill, women—could not participate even in smallholder democracy. The Greek rules according to which the society was organized tended to be “extractive”—at least if you were not one of the <em>equals</em> who were full citizens. And the economy was largely based upon slavery. (Do note, however, that with some notable exceptions like the Spartan <em>helots</em> and the Athenian and Syracusan mines), this slavery was small-scale rather than plantation slavery: it was ripping somebody out of their social context and placing them in a position in which they had no family or other trusted companions to provide them with any social power.)</p><p>At and near its peak, the civilization had astonishing creative achievements. Look at the people of ancient classical civilization. In rhetoric and politics, we have Perikles and Cicero. In generalship, should we have Cæsar and Alexander. In governance? We have Augustus and Trajan. In philosophy we have Aristotle and Plato. In sculpture and literature we have Praxiteles and Sophokles. They are our equal, even though they knew much less and did not stand on the shoulders of giants.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696538d0-939f-4329-9e32-63fba1ed7f4c_1426x768.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696538d0-939f-4329-9e32-63fba1ed7f4c_1426x768.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696538d0-939f-4329-9e32-63fba1ed7f4c_1426x768.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696538d0-939f-4329-9e32-63fba1ed7f4c_1426x768.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696538d0-939f-4329-9e32-63fba1ed7f4c_1426x768.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/696538d0-939f-4329-9e32-63fba1ed7f4c_1426x768.png" width="1426" height="768" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/696538d0-939f-4329-9e32-63fba1ed7f4c_1426x768.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:1426,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1203106,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696538d0-939f-4329-9e32-63fba1ed7f4c_1426x768.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696538d0-939f-4329-9e32-63fba1ed7f4c_1426x768.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696538d0-939f-4329-9e32-63fba1ed7f4c_1426x768.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696538d0-939f-4329-9e32-63fba1ed7f4c_1426x768.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Even in something like making a good living through mass media via presenting yourself as a celebrity there were equivalents then who are our equals now. Consider Mnesarete of Thespiai. Her name means “Remembrance of Excellence”. But she was called Phryne: toad. Why? Because&nbsp; people thought her skin color, yellow, was like that of a toad. That was thought very very attractive in the Athens of the -300s. Phryne was the favorite model for Aphrodite of the sculptors of her day. And I do not think she would have had anything to learn from Kim Kardashian about how to manage your celebrity. After all, 2000 years after her death people were still writing poems about and marveling at statues of her as Aphrodite.</p><p>The ancients were—at least those who were not protein-deprived <em>in utero</em> from malnutrition—our equals in intelligence, cultural sophistication, mechanical ingenuity,&nbsp; intellectual creativity, and, in short, in the ability to think and do.</p><p>Let me pick one example of Greek accomplishment that is at least adjacent to the process of technological innovation and development that has driven our civilization to its high prosperity. Let me talk about the Anti-Kythera Mechanism.</p><p>Found in a shipwreck offshore of the southern tip of the Peloponnesian peninsula, the Anti-Kythera Mechanism was built between -150 and -70, probably by artisans and scientists on the island of Rhodes. As reconstructed, its outer shell was a 13” x 7” x 4“ wooden box Inside were gears—with the largest of them 5” in diameter. It looks as though there were 37 gear wheels in all.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01f4d453-2693-4cbe-bc45-84906e984357_1414x824.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01f4d453-2693-4cbe-bc45-84906e984357_1414x824.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01f4d453-2693-4cbe-bc45-84906e984357_1414x824.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01f4d453-2693-4cbe-bc45-84906e984357_1414x824.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01f4d453-2693-4cbe-bc45-84906e984357_1414x824.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/01f4d453-2693-4cbe-bc45-84906e984357_1414x824.png" width="1414" height="824" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/01f4d453-2693-4cbe-bc45-84906e984357_1414x824.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:824,&quot;width&quot;:1414,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:816062,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01f4d453-2693-4cbe-bc45-84906e984357_1414x824.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01f4d453-2693-4cbe-bc45-84906e984357_1414x824.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01f4d453-2693-4cbe-bc45-84906e984357_1414x824.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01f4d453-2693-4cbe-bc45-84906e984357_1414x824.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>It was a mechanical computer, a clock calendar, astronomical observation and modeling device. By turning a crank on the side, you turned the interlinked gears to make pointers on the outside of the box tell you the location of astronomical objects on any particular day. A user of the Anti-Kythera Mechanism could thus follow the movements of the Moon and the Sun through the zodiac. He—almost surely a “he”—could predict when it was likely that there might be eclipses. The box even modeled the irregular orbit of the Moon, for the Moon's orbit is not a circle but an ellipse, and so its velocity as it revolves around the earth is greater when the moon is near its perigee than when it is near its apogee. (That motion had been studied in the late -100s by the astronomer Hipparkhos of Rhodes; a natural speculation is that he may have been involved in the mechanism’s construction.) It includes, in concrete mechanical gear-driven form, the most advanced astronomy known to the Greeks.</p><p>The technological competence to make such a mechanism was lost. The astronomical knowledge was lost in the Latin Western Mediterranean, but preserved in the Greek Eastern Mediterranean and eagerly sought by the Muslim Middle-East, where the transfer of a copy of Claudius Ptolemy’s <em>Almagest</em> to Baghdad was demanded by the Kalifa Al-Ma’mun before he would sign a peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire. What they made was less complex, however: mechanisms of similar complexity would not be seen again until the mechanical astronomical clocks made in Western Europe more than a thousand years later, in the 1300s. Ancient civilization was capable of making devices of extraordinary complexity and precision.</p><p>When it was shipwrecked, the Anti-Kythera Mechanism was being carried from somewhere in the Aegean Sea region to somewhere in Italy. Was it booty that Roman commanders were carrying home after a successful conquest or raid? Was it commissioned by some wealthy Roman worthy to put on display in his house? Was it going to be an educational tool that a Greek philosopher or slave-tutor would use for demonstrations or lessons? We do not know.</p><p>Marcus Tullius Cicero wrote, in his <em>De Re Publica</em>, about the wonders of modern science and the ability to build… <em>spherai</em> is what he calls them. Which means “sphere”, as you'd expect it to do. But it clearly has a special technical meaning here: a model to show the movements of the stars and the planets, the Moon, the Sun. We don't know exactly what Cicero was talking about:</p><blockquote><p>C. Sulpicius Gallus… by chance in the house of [his one-time co-consul] M. Marcellus… [saw] a <em>sphere</em>… which the ancestor of M. Marcellus had taken from the conquered Syracusans… out of their wealthy and embellished city; the only thing he had possessed himself of among so great a spoil… which Arkhimedes also had made…. When Gallus began very scientifically to explain the nature of the mechanism; the Sicilian [Arkhimedes] appeared to me to possess more genius, than human nature would seem to be capable of…. The motions of the sun, moon, and those five stars which are called wandering…. Arkhimedes… had discovered a method of producing the unequal and various courses, with their dissimilar velocities…. The moon was made to succeed the sun by as many revolutions of the brass circle, as it actually took days to do in the heavens…</p></blockquote><p>Was this a similar mechanism? Probably.</p><p>We do know he ascribed the <em>spherai</em> to Archimedes. We do know that the Roman aristocrats who had these things were interested in collecting them as booty and bringing them back as wonders to display after successful wars—much more interested than in say, founding universities or endowing departments of astronomy and astronomical knowledge.</p><p>The only kingdom who seriously did do that was the Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt that established, maintained and supported the Library of Alexandria. The Roman emperors as they succeeded the Ptolemies continued the practice. But that was it.</p><p>Military research and development? Yes. Staff architects for the waterworks? Yes. More general natural philosophers? No. They accomplished they accomplished great things. They could have accomplished greater things. And yet they did not.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>CONDITION: Is “Zero COVID” Sustainable?:</h2><p><strong>BBC</strong>: <em>Shanghai Covid: China Announces Largest City-Wide Lockdown</em>: ‘China has announced its biggest city-wide lockdown since the Covid outbreak began more than two years ago.

It is a stubborn beast. And it will likely fight us stubbornly so that all that we will attain will be half-a-loaf. Going back to social democracy—prioritizing full employment, an egalitarian income distribution, and a focus on policies compensating for externalities, plus giving voice to the many rather than the monied in deciding what society's priorities should be—seems likely to me to assemblr larger coalition and lead to much better outcomes than various things that are on offer. However, if you want to see someone who wants to move forward to something better than social democracy rather than simply settling for half-a-loaf, Darrick Hamilton is the person to pay attention to:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Darrick Hamilton</strong>: <em>Neoliberalism &amp; Race</em>: ‘Younger generations and social movements may be expanding our priorities and notions of economic good away from the self-interested neoliberal frame to one that incorporates morality, sustainability, and humanity. Hopefully, it will lead to a politics that is not narrowly constrained by the status quo of what does and does not seem feasible at a given moment based on our immediate past. Hopefully, it will lead to a transformative race- and-gender conscious economic bill of rights. One that will ensure universally accessible quality jobs, health care, housing, schooling, financial services, capital, and one that ensures free mobility without the psychological (and physical) threat of detention or bodily harm.

I would not, however, say that he has an extraordinary gift for synthesis: he has, rather, an extraordinary gift for learning and knowing stuff and learning and knowing the right stuff. A synthest imposes their view of reality upon readers. Adam gives you the information to construct your own view:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Molly Fischer</strong>: <em>The Cult of Adam Tooze</em>: ‘Tooze’s great intellectual power is a gift for synthesis. “He just digests staggering amounts of information,” said Ted Fertik… historical data, technical data, data about Russian currency reserves, data about the Nazi steel-tube industry — and returns with a reasonably accessible brief in hand. His omnivorously quantitative approach combines with his economic expertise to reveal familiar subjects in new ways…. The media contingent of Tooze’s fan base are readers who relish a chance to “feel marginally superior to Matt Yglesias,” as journalist Alex Pareene put it. Tooze conveys substance—a sense of undeniable expertise—in a way few of his fellow explainers can match…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/adam-tooze-profile.html">https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/adam-tooze-profile.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p></p><p></p>
