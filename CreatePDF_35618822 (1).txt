Roderick MacFarquhar (1992a€“12a€“17): Denga€™ s Last Campaign'. a€~China had its own form of 
grueling political campaign this year, which ended when the Fourteenth Congress of the Communist 
Party (CCP) took place in October. There, too, the issue was a€cechangea€D and the main concern the 
economy. But in China the economy has been in good shape: it was the aged incumbent who wanted ever 
more change to keep it that way, and he won.

Of course, Deng Xiaoping is a very peculiar sort of a€ceincumbent.a€D The a€cepatriarch,a€D as some 
Hong Kong papers like to call him, no longer has any formal post. At eighty-eight, he reportedly 
spends much of his time amusing his grandchildren and playing bridge with his cronies, leaving the 
daily conduct of affairs to the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiang Zemin, the 
premier, Li Peng, and their colleagues in the Politburo
standing committee (PSC). It is only on major matters of national policy, such as voting in the UN 
on the use of force against Saddam Hussein, that the PSC consults Deng and does what he 
a€ceadvises.a€D

But this year has been different. Deng campaigned outside the capital (as Mao sometimes did), 
advocating a controversial policy: drastic change to promote economic growth, the key issue for 
Deng during the past fourteen years in which he has been ChinaaC™ s paramount leader. Since the 
Cultural Revolution, when the CCP almost committed hara kiri, Deng has consistently seen rapid 
economic development as the only way for it to recover its authority. Using
one of those numerical formulas particularly beloved by Chinese and relentlessly used by the 
Communists to help their officials to keep policies straight, Denga€™ s motto has been the a€oeone 
center and the two basic points .a€D The central task is economic development; one of the two basic 
points is persevering in Denga€™ s policy of economic reform and opening up to the outside world (I 
will deal presently with the second, more ideological point).

Translated into Chinese terms, this means maintaining the system of privatized agriculture that 
replaced collective farms, closing or eventually privatizing much unprofitable state industry, 
dismantling central planning generally in favor of private entrepreneurship and the market, and 
fully integrating China into the global economy.

The old guard that re-emerged with Deng after the Cultural Revolution agreed with him on the need 
to elevate economics above the class struggle, which Mao had made the nationa€™ s a€oekey linka€D 
or central guiding principle. But they wanted a return to the ideas that their economic guru, Chen 
Yun, had circulated before the Cultural Revolution, when Chen himself seemed like a radical 
right-winger to Mao for disdaining the voodoo economics of his
Great Leap Forward. Chen never abandoned his views, preferring silence to selling out, obscurity to 
holding office.

Now, after the shift of Chinaa€™ s political spectrum to the a€cerighta€D under Deng, i.e., toward 
privatization and a market economy, Chena€™ s advocacy of a a€cebirdcage economya€Da€”allowing the 
market freedom only within the central plan, like a bird in a cagea€”puts him on the conservative 
left. Chena€™ s supporters are engaged in what is overtly a semantic debatea€’’should the market 
economy be called a€ ce socialistic □ or
a€cecapitalista€D?a€”but behind the talk they are fighting a rearguard battle to recapture the 
Party.

Where a€celefta€D and a€cerighta€D come together is on political values. Denga€™ s second basic 
point consists of another numerical formula, the four cardinal principles of Chinese communism: 
Party leadership, socialism, proletarian dictatorship, and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. 
Adhering to them, he argues, will ensure political stability by maintaining the legitimacy of the 
CCP and preventing a€ cepe aceful evolutionaCD toward bourgeois
democracy. Deng and Chen undoubtedly agree, for instance, on putting pressure on Hong Kong to 
prevent Chris Patten, the new governor appointed by John Major, from nudging the colony toward 
democracy.

But the crux of the Chinese political argument has been over whether or not there is a 
a€cecontradictiona€D between Denga€™ s two basic points: Will economic change solidify or subvert 
Party leadership and other Communist political values? Deng believes that radical economic reform 
and opening up to the outside world are the only way to prevent the CCP from following the Soviet 
Communist Party into the dustbin of history. But Chen is convinced that

The views of Chen and Deng Liqun and their allies were reflected in a flurry of leftist articles in 
nationally circulated newspapers a year ago. Deng Xiaoping was probably particularly provoked since 
they were attacks on articles extolling his views which were published following his visit to 
Shanghai, ChinaaC™ s main industrial center, in the citya€™ s principal paper. Indeed, Deng went 
campaigning this year mainly to combat the views of Chen and Deng
Liqun.

In mid-January, Deng suddenly turned up in the southern province of Guangdong and revisited the 
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) on the border with Hong Kong. Set up in 1980 along with three 
other SEZs, Shenzhen was entrusted with working out a model for Chinaa€™ s absorption of foreign 
capital, technology, and management practices. When I visited Shenzhen, in the mida€‘T980s, it 
still had the look of a frontier town: unfinished streets and
houses, much construction, eager young men and women flocking in from all over China. The local 
motto was a€oetime is money, efficiency is life.a€D Foreign firms were having their difficulties, 
but much was happening and hope was in the air. But when I flew over Hong Kong earlier this year in 
a helicopter, Shenzhen looked like just one more distant high-rise suburb of the British colony, 
which in a very real sense it now is. Hong Kong entrepreneurs
employ three million workers in south China in industries ranging from plastics to plate glass, 
three times as many as in Hong Kong itself.

Shenzhen has gradually been transformed from an experiment into the chief model for economic reform 
and for opening up China to foreign investments. But for Denga€™ s conservative colleagues, it has 
continued to symbolize the dangers of those policies. A century ago, opium came in through the 
treaty ports; today the Special Economic Zones attract the modern opiates of the masses, 
materialism, corruption and, once again, drugs. Periodically, attempts
have been made to stamp these out, and an 86-kilometer fence was constructed between Shenzhen and 
the rest of China to localize the infection. Deng went to Shenzhen to give the SEZ system his final 
blessing:

I came to Guangdong in 1984. At that point, rural reform had been going for a few years, urban 
reform was just starting, and the special zones were taking their first steps. Eight years have 
gone by and I would never have believed that on this visit I would find that Shenzhen and Zhuhai 
special zones had developed so fast [the Zhuhai special zone borders on Macao]. Having seen it, my 
confidence has increased. Clearly he had seen the future and it worked. The
revolution had been the first step in liberating the countrya€™ s productive forces, Deng said, and 
reform was the second; with reform, Guangdong could catch up with Asiaa€™ s a€oefour little 
dragonsa€Da€”South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singaporea€”over the next twenty years. Deng 
admitted that opening up to the outside world had exposed parts of China to drugs, prostitution, 
and corruption and called for a crackdown on these a€oerepulsive
things.a€D China, he said, had to emulate and surpass SingaporeaC™ s strict civic discipline.

In striking ways, Denga€™ s rhetoric echoed Maoa€™ s at his most headstrong. Deng warned against 
moving slowly to make reforms, like women with bound feet, precisely the simile used by Mao when he 
launched his big collectivization drive in 1955. Deng called for a spirit of a€cerashness,a€D using 
exactly the word over which Mao and Chen Yun had fallen out on the eve of the disastrous Great Leap 
Forward. Like Mao, Deng emphasized that the human
factor was critical to all progress, and he showed a tendency to minimize economic problems very 
typical of Mao:

In a€~89 we began to implement adjustment [of the economy]. I supported it, and whata€™ s more it 
was necessary. The economy was a€ceoverheatinga€D and that really caused a few problems. For 
instance, there was a bit too much currency in circulation, prices had risen a bit, and duplication 
of construction was quite serious and had caused some waste. But how should one appraise the speed 
of development of those five years
overall? The speed of development during those five years could be termed a flying leap.

But of course it was different from the a€oeGreat Leap Forwarda€D; it didna€™t harm the economic 
framework or mechanism. Indeed, it is possible that Deng actually went even further than this, but 
that his remarks were laundered in the propaganda department. According to a Hong Kong Chinese 
paper, Deng actually stated that reform and the need to open up China demanded a a€oegreat leap 
forward.a€D

Denga€™ s remarks reflected an argument going on behind the scenes: Had it really been necessary 
for the economic ministries to damp down growth during the past three years in order to counter 
inflation and over-investment? Denga€™ s ambivalent position in Shenzhen confirmed that on this 
question he was a doubter who considered that the official target growth rate of 6 percent was too 
slow. Chen Yun could be forgiven if he had a familiar frisson on
hearing this. Had China survived Mao only to fall under the spell of the sorcerera€™ s apprentice?

As he traveled through Shenzhen and Zhuhai, and later Shanghai (which is undergoing major 
expansion), Deng reserved his strongest attacks for leftists like Chen Yun. He made it clear that 
his old opponents, who criticized the reforms as promoting capitalism, were even more likely to 
ruin socialism than people on the a€ceright,a€D whose liberalism had made possible upheavals like 
the one in Tiananmen Square. Denga€™ s message was that throughout its
history the CCP had suffered quite enough from leftism.6 His problem was how to get it across.

Even Mao in his heyday sometimes had trouble getting controversial views published nationally. 
a€oeShit, or get off the pot,a€D he once told a foot-dragging chief editor of the main CCP organ, 
the Peoplea€™ s Daily, and later sacked him. Deng had the same problem this year with the 
conservatives who took control of the propaganda apparatus after the Tiananmen crackdown. His 
praise of the Special Economic Zones was carried by the local press, including
Communist-run papers in Hong Kong. But it was a month before his remarks were incorporated into a 
document that was to be distributed internally throughout the central governments’’and even that 
was held upa€”and a second month passed before the Peoplea€™ s Daily and the national television 
station publicized his words and deeds.

The reaction to Denga€™ s remarks fully justified the worries of the conservatives. A wave of 
euphoria seems to have swept through the reformist think tanks of Beijing when rumors of Denga€™ s 
southern expedition first began to circulate in the early spring. Everyone knew that Deng was 
battling to ensure that the CCPa€™ s Fourteenth Congress would be held amid a renewed upsurge of 
fervor for reform, so that the group of leaders he wanted to succeed
him would emerge dominant, ready to lead China into the twenty-first century. Party leaders were 
quick to support him. The central committee and State Council issued directives for speeding up 
reform and growth. Premier Li Penga€™ s report to the annual National Peoplea€™ s Congress in March 
was criticized there as insufficiently enthusiastic about economic reform and had to be revised in 
line with Denga€™ s Shenzhen pronouncements. The respected
Party historian Liao Gailong, a long-time supporter of Deng and reform, warned against leftist 
attempts to rehabilitate the extremist views of Maoa€™ s later years. Tian Jiyun, a vice-premier 
and follower of Deng, ridiculed the leftists in a speech given at the Central Party School, which 
became a best-selling videotape. Reportedly Tian was heartily applauded by his supposedly 
conservative audience when he sarcastically suggested the leftists should be given
their own territory in which to practice command-economy socialism:

Let us carve out a piece of land where policies favored by the leftists will be practiced. For 
example, no foreign investment will be allowed there, and all foreigners will be kept out. 
Inhabitants of the zone can neither go abroad nor send their children overseas. There will be total 
state planning. Essential supplies will be rationed and denizens of the zone will have to queue up 
for food and other consumer goodsa€!.Some leftists have
derived immense material benefit from the policy of reform and the open door, but they still 
bad-mouth the policy.

All seemed set for a reformist sweep at the Fourteenth Congress. But a funny thing happened on the 
way to the Great Hall of the People, where it was to meet. Battered but unbowed by the repression 
since the Tiananmen Square events, the dissident intellectuals spoke out.

In April, a book of articles by mostly obscure writers was rushed off the press under the 
portentous title The Tide of History. Though edited by a Peking University lecturer who is 
suspended from teaching for his alleged part in the Tiananmen events, the book had the imprimatur 
of an aged conservative official, Bo Yibo, who was somehow persuaded to put a motto in his 
calligraphy at the front of the book. The official later indicated he did so because the authors
did not put forward any radical ideasa€”the radicals are either abroad, in prison, or lying 
lowa€”but were concerned rather to give whole-hearted backing to Denga€™ s attack on leftism. Among 
the booka€™ s contributors, the former Peoplea€™ s Daily editor Hu Jiwei gave a critical account of 
the recent upsurge of leftism. Maoa€™ s onetime secretary, Li Rui, writing under a pseudonym, 
warned that many of todaya€™ s leftist theorists were radicals during
the Cultural Revolution and had attacked Deng then too.

The leftists, who are still powerful in the Party, were deeply troubled by the book, and the CCPa€™ 
s propaganda department quickly had it suppressed. The Tide of History was a damning indictment of 
their activities, and they did not want conferred on it the respectability of the open circulation 
of 30,000 copies. What was particularly alarming was that, for the first time since June 4,1989, 
reformist intellectuals had defied the heavy pressures to which they had
been subjected since the Tiananmen Square events and taken spontaneous, collective, and public 
action against the left. Nor were the reformists cowed by the booka€™ s banning. The editor filed a 
suit against the publisher and the press authorities, and in June, he and about a hundred other 
anti-leftists held, in Beijing, a symposium favoring reform, at which another disgraced Peoplea€™ s 
Daily editor, Wang Ruoshui, argued that the widespread corruption
which the left attributed to decadent capitalist ideas was in fact produced by the absence of 
democracy and the rule of law.

As if all this were not enough, a devastating broadside was fired from California by Xu Jiatun, the 
onetime central committee member and chief Communist emissary in Hong Kong, who had chosen exile in 
the US in 1990 for reasons that are not entirely clear. On the eve of the third anniversary of the 
Tiananmen Square repression, Xu broke his two-year silence with a long article in the Hong 
Kong-based South China Morning Post, urging his former colleagues
to a€oeshake off the shackles of the Leninist and Stalinist models and choose a new path to 
socialism that fits ChinaaC™ s special conditions and has Chinese characteristics.a€D Xu presumably 
thought he was being helpful to Deng Xiaoping by arguing that borrowing from the best of capitalism 
could ensure the survival of communism, because that is what Deng is trying to do. But Xua€™ s 
claim that ChinaaC™ s Leninist polity needed to be reformed, and
his characterization of a€oeequality, freedom, democracy and a democratic political systemaCD as 
the a€oecommon wealth of mankinda€D were as much anathema to Deng as to Chen Yun.

With supporters like these rocking the boat, Deng knew he could expect renewed opposition from the 
conservative gerontocrats. Indeed, Deng Liqun made a southern tour of his own to drum up support 
for the conservative position, and ordered that an anthology of unorthodox statements from 1978 to 
the present be prepared as a counterblast to The Tide of History. In this heated atmosphere, Deng 
Xiaoping decided to make an example of one of the reformers.
His unfortunate victim was Bao Tong, the chief aide of the reformist Party secretary Zhao Ziyang 
when the Tiananmen demonstrations occurred. Both he and Bao Tong were then detained and put under 
house arrest.

For a long time now, rumors have circulated in Beijing that Zhao might be rehabilitated. Deng, it 
has been said, wanted him back in some ceremonial position to show that the former general 
secretarya€™ s disgrace after June 4 should not be taken as casting doubt on the reform program 
with which Zhao had been closely associated. On his southern tour, Deng Xiaoping made a point of 
saying that he had not been critical of Zhaoa€™ s handling of the economy.
Deng and Zhao apparently could not agree on the terms under which Zhao would return to public life, 
but early this year some said Zhao would be appointed as chairman of the powerless Peoplea€™ s 
Political Consultative Conference. Bao Tong, according to some other accounts, was to be used as a 
scapegoat to justify Zhaoa€™ s rehabilitation. If any such scheme were in the works, the plan to 
punish Bao Tong was the only part of it that remained after the
controversy surrounding The Tide of History.

In January this year, Premier Li Peng had asked for Bao Tonga€™ s formal arrest, and this took 
place in February. But Lia€™ s PSC colleagues reserved their views on Bao Tonga€™ s fate, knowing 
that Deng would have to have the last word on so sensitive an issue. In May, Qiao Shi, the PSC 
member in charge of public security, circulated a note to his colleagues saying that Bao Tonga€™ s 
case should probably be settled within the Party rather than by
formal trial. Both General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Li Peng drew circles opposite their names on 
the memo, the CCP way of signifying assent, probably because of the implications of Denga€™ s 
southern tour. Unexpectedly, Denga€™ s office intervened to say that Bao Tong was a bad person and 
should be punished. And so he was. On July 21, after a a€cetriala€D lasting less than six hours, 
Bao Tong was sentenced to seven years for leaking state secrets; in
fact he did no more than give a few junior colleagues three daysa€™ advance notice of the 
declaration of martial law. As for Zhao Ziyang, the Politburo confirmed its condemnation of him in 
1989, but formally put an end to any further examination of his case. (He continues under effective 
house arrest but has some freedom of movement.)

A more critical decision by Deng concerned the fate of Premier Li Peng. While allowing Zhaoa€™ s 
return might reasonably have been seen as a gesture in favor of reform and not as reversing the 
regimea€™ s verdicts on the Tiananmen Square massacre, the simultaneous removal of Li Peng, the 
front man for the hard-liners who suppressed the students with tanks, would have given immense 
encouragement to a far wider constituency than the authors of The
Tide of History. In August, Deng apparently decided that there had been enough turbulence at the 
top levels of government and that the balanced team of Jiang Zemin and Li Peng should be kept in 
power, at least for the present.

Li Peng has been on his best behavior for some time, concentrating on economics and paying 
lip-service to reform. He learned the hard way after Tiananmen that it would be immensely damaging 
economically, and therefore politically, to try to turn the clock back to the Stalinist command 
economy model. Lia€™ s ability to run the Chinese economy is widely derided in Beijing. But at 
least under his premiership, the price system has been given greater
flexibility and there have been privatizing reforms in the real estate market which, earlier this 
year, have resulted in the leasing of 1,500 parcels of state land for rents totaling over three 
billion yuan. Local governments see the new policy as a major source of revenue and foreign 
exchange in the years ahead; the new island province of Hainan, for example, has leased an area of 
seventeen square kilometers to a Japanese corporation, which will have total control of
the  land and its use for seventy years, except for policing.

After much debate, stock markets have also been opened in Shanghai and Shenzhen. In August, there 
was a large-scale riot in Shenzhen by would-be stock purchasers who felt they were not being 
allowed a fair chance to invest and who attacked government property and police. It was the 
reformist vice-premier, Zhu Rongji, not Li Peng, according to Chinese sources, who then floated the 
idea that the Shenzhen exchange be closed for a cooling-off period. Deng
Xiaoping, whose earlier praise of the progress in Shenzhen had been made to look overenthusiastic, 
vetoed the idea. No more embarrassments could be allowed to mar the preparations of the Fourteenth 
Congress.

Fortunately for Deng, the Shenzhen riot was soon over. His position was strengthened by the booming 
economy, largely the result of the changes he has presided over during the past fourteen years, and 
by his 1992 campaign. Chinaa€™ s GNP grew 12 percent in the first half of 1992, and on the eve of 
the Congress, Chinese economists were predicting 10 percent growth for the entire year, as compared 
with 7 percent in 1991. The result was closer to Denga€™ s
target of 12 percent than Li Penga€™ s of 6 percent. Industrial output had gone up 17.5 percent by 
the end of June, with the most spectacular increases being registered in the nonstate sectors, and 
the summer harvest was the best in history. During the first half of 1992, foreign investors made 
commitments worth $14.6 billion, over 300 percent more than in 1991, and foreign trade, at $68.7 
billion, was up over 20 percent. ChinaaC™ s foreign exchange reserves,
about equal to those of the US last year, are predicted to top $50 billion this year.

After all the alarms and Denga€™ s excursions, and his behind-the-scenes manipulations, the 
Fourteenth Congress could have been something of an anticlimax. In the Leninist tradition, the 
leaders of the 51 million-member CCP like to have the Partya€™ s congresses carefully prepared in 
advance, with all potential problems ironed out at the customary summer work conference at the 
seaside resort of Beidaihe. But Deng still had some surprises in store. Having
compromised with the conservatives on the top of the ticket, he apparently hoped that the momentum 
for reform built up by his campaign would accomplish two goals. First, he wanted the Fourteenth 
Congress to result in the Party Standing Committee being reinvigorated with more dynamic and 
reform-minded officials than Party Secretary General Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng; and, second, 
he wanted to have his political and economic philosophy
enshrined in the Congress documents. By and large he succeeded in both aims.

In his political report to the Congress, Jiang Zemin proclaimed that Chinaa€™ s modernization had 
entered a new phase as a result of Denga€™ s tour, and he gave the current view of the patriarcha€™ 
s place in history. This boiled down to the proposition that while Mao won China, Deng developed 
it.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the general architect of the reform and opening up as well as of the 
modernization related to socialism in Chinaa€!.Inheriting from the predecessors but also breaking 
down the obsolete, he demonstrates a tremendous political courage in opening up new paths in 
socialist construction and a tremendous theoretical courage to open up a new realm in Marxism, 
thereby making an important and historic
contribution to the establishment of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
17 Jiang reaffirmed Denga€™ s theory of the single centera€”developmenta€”and repeated Denga€™ s 
dictum that leftism, not rightism, was the principal danger within the CCP. In a sinister phrase 
that recalled Maoa€™ s warning hints to his colleagues on the eve of the Cultural Revolution, Jiang 
added that this was the case,


The leftists, who are still powerful in the Party, were deeply troubled by the book, and the CCPa€™ 
s propaganda department quickly had it suppressed. The Tide of History was a damning indictment of 
their activities, and they did not want conferred on it the respectability of the open circulation

about equal to those of the US last year, are predicted to top $50 billion this year.

After all the alarms and Denga€™ s excursions, and his behind-the-scenes manipulations, the 
Fourteenth Congress could have been something of an anticlimax. In the Leninist tradition, the 
leaders of the 51 million-member CCP like to have the Partya€™ s congresses carefully prepared in 
advance, with all potential problems ironed out at the customary summer work conference at the 
seaside resort of Beidaihe. But Deng still had some surprises in store. Having
compromised with the conservatives on the top of the ticket, he apparently hoped that the momentum 
for reform built up by his campaign would accomplish two goals. First, he wanted the Fourteenth 
Congress to result in the Party Standing Committee being reinvigorated with more dynamic and 
reform-minded officials than Party Secretary General Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng; and, second, 
he wanted to have his political and economic philosophy
enshrined in the Congress documents. By and large he succeeded in both aims.

In his political report to the Congress, Jiang Zemin proclaimed that Chinaa€™ s modernization had 
entered a new phase as a result of Denga€™ s tour, and he gave the current view of the patriarcha€™ 
s place in history. This boiled down to the proposition that while Mao won China, Deng developed 
it.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the general architect of the reform and opening up as well as of the 
modernization related to socialism in Chinaa€!.Inheriting from the predecessors but also breaking 
down the obsolete, he demonstrates a tremendous political courage in opening up new paths in 
socialist construction and a tremendous theoretical courage to open up a new realm in Marxism, 
thereby making an important and historic
contribution to the establishment of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
17 Jiang reaffirmed Denga€™ s theory of the single centera€”developmenta€”and repeated Denga€™ s 
dictum that leftism, not rightism, was the principal danger within the CCP. In a sinister phrase 
that recalled Maoa€™ s warning hints to his colleagues on the eve of the Cultural Revolution, Jiang 
added that this was the case,
a€oeparticularly among the leading cadres.a€D At least while Deng is alive and able to function 
politically, the careers of leftists are at risk unless they toe the line.

This was made clear at the Congress itself. The Central Advisory Committee (CAC) headed by Chen Yun 
was disbanded. This group of distinguished political veterans was set up by Deng ten years ago in 
order to persuade his colleagues to retire to a prestigious but largely powerless committee, but 
they had refused to fade away. Under Chen, the CACa€™ s conservative gerontocrats had made use of 
their constitutional right to sit in on meetings of Party leaders,
and at the time of Tiananmen their support of Deng was crucial. As late as August, the CAC drew up 
a ten-point memorandum for the Congress stressing the problems of reform and expressing skepticism 
about rapid growth. Without Deng to offset its conservative influence, the CAC could be a serious 
threat to a reform leadership and it had to go. Deng also ensured that leading leftist ideologues 
were dropped from the central committee, including the director
of the CCPa€™ s propaganda department, the acting minister of culture, and the director of the 
PeopledC™ s Daily.

Preliminary analysis of the new leadership suggests that there has been an influx of reformers and 
officials, though many members of the new central committee are difficult to categorize. Eight 
Politburo members retired for a variety of reasons, including age, leftism, and, probably, 
incompetence. The sixteen newcomers include the Party bosses of the fast-growing Guangdong province 
and of the coastal province of Shandong, which hopes for development
capital from South Korea as a result of Beijinga€™ s recent normalizing of relations with Seoul. 
With the departure of two leading conservatives from the PSC, the new seven-man line-up of the 
Partya€™ s formally supreme policy-making body is tilted in favor of Deng, who still holds decisive 
power on the sidelines. Zhu Rongji, like Jiang Zemin once the boss of Shanghai, is widely seen as 
the emerging economic overlord who could replace Li Peng as
premier next year. In the central committee, there has been considerable turnover: 47 percent of 
the members are newly elected this year, and only 3 percent have been members for more than ten 
years.

There were two surprises. The minor one was that members of the a€oeprincesa€™ party,a€D the 
children of the elite, fared badly. Denga€™ s daughter did not make it into the central committee, 
and Chen Yuna€™ s technocrat son was not even elected a delegate to the Congress. After the 
collapse of communism in the Soviet Union, some of the aged Chinese leaders argued that their 
legacy could be entrusted only to their children. But Deng presumably
remembered that a significant element in the protests against official corruption in 1989 was 
disgust with the way some Communist princelings had benefited from corrupt deals, especially with 
foreign companies hoping to profit from their connections.

The more significant surprise was the way Deng dealt with the problem of the military. Since 
generals won China for the CCP, the army has been a far bigger factor in politics in Beijing than 
the Red Army ever was in Moscow, reaching the height of its power at the Ninth Congress in 1969 
when the defense minister, Marshal Lin Biao, was named Maoa€™ s heir apparent. Two years later, the 
ill-fated marshal died in a plane crash in Mongolia, allegedly fleeing
after an abortive plot on Maoa€™ s life. But it took another fourteen years, well after Maoa€™ s 
death, before Deng was able to retire the military to the barracks. Then the Tiananmen crisis 
brought the army back into politics and underlined the critical importance of its loyalty to the 
survival of the CCP and its leaders.

While Jiang Zemin is nominally chairman of the Partya€™ s Military Affairs Commission, during the 
past three years it has seemingly been controlled by two prominent members of the Yang family: PRC 
President Yang Shangkun, a close ally of Denga€™ s, and his half-brother, General Yang Baibing. 
Throughout 1992, Yang Baibing has attempted to demonstrate his loyalty by using his position as 
head of the armya€™ s political department to give wide
circulation to Denga€™ s latest pronouncements. But at the Congress, Yang Shangkun was retired from 
the Politburo on grounds of old age; Yang Baibing took his place, but in doing so he lost his 
command post in the Military Affairs Commission. In place of the politically ambitious and younger 
Yang, Deng has called back into service Admiral Liu Huaqing, a retired civil war subordinate of his 
whom he presumably considers too old or too disciplined, or both,
to challenge the civilian leadership. When Admiral Liu, who joined the Communist forces sixty years 
ago at the age of fifteen and took part in the Long March, was suddenly appointed to the PSC, 
nobody could mistake who ran the army.

All in all, the Congress seemed a highly successful conclusion to what is surely Denga€™ s last 
campaign. He did not attend the week-long sessions, and was able to put in only a twenty-minute 
cameo appearance the day after they ended to receive applause and silently signify approval. And 
yet Deng must be well aware that his triumph is as fragile as he himself seemed during his brief 
visit to the Great Hall of the People. One difference between his victorious
campaign and Governor Clintona€™ s is that the president-elect is guaranteed four years in power, 
whereas Jiang Zemin and his colleagues, whom Deng has put in office, are guaranteed nothing. The 
failure to institutionalize the succession process remains a crippling weakness at the top of the 
CCP. Since the Peoplea€™ s Republic of China was founded forty-three years ago, there have been six 
heirs apparent, but none held that position for more than one Party
congress. Even Hua Guofeng, who actually did succeed Mao, as Mao intended, found that combining the 
chairmanships of the CCP and the Military Affairs Commission, and the premiership of the State 
Council, was insufficient to keep him in power.

To hold high office is only one source of authority in China, as the aged and nominally retired 
Deng demonstrated this year. The very fact that Deng felt it necessary to campaign in the provinces 
shows how weak he considers the a€cepower-holdersa€D in the Politburo to be. So if Deng is the 
first of the remaining gerontocrats to a€oego to meet Marx,a€Das Mao used to put it, his more 
conservative colleagues could upset the carefully calculated leadership
arrangements made at the Fourteenth Congress, especially if the great economic leap which Deng has 
launched goes awry. Todaya€™ s leaders could become yesterdaya€™ s men tomorrow. Even if Deng lives 
longer than the others, the unsettling problem of a€oeAfter Deng, who?a€D will remain.

Nor is there any guarantee that, by putting a serving officer in the PSC, Deng has finessed the 
military problem rather than simply trumped his own acea€”the apparently loyal Yang Baibing. Liu 
Huaqing may be loyal to Deng, but if the going gets rough, will he be any more obedient to Jiang 
Zemin than earlier generals were to Hua Guofeng? Would he order troops to fire if workersrioted 
because their factory was being closed down as a result of reforms?20
The army has become far more professionalized during the reform period, and officers may genuinely 
desire to stay out of politics. But so long as the main civilian institutions and their leaders 
require military men to help prop them up, the answer to the question whether the Party or the army 
will prevail a€oeafter Denga€D will not be finally settled.

Does it matter? Is the reform program so successfully entrenched that it cannot be changed, even if 
the conservative leaders who distrust reform regain power? Clearly Deng does not think so or he 
would not have left the bridge table to tour the country. He knows from CCP history that realism 
has never been an obstacle to determined ideologues convinced of their rectitude.

Moreover, in the great debate over change and political values that has raged in China this year, 
it is almost certainly Chen Yun whose assessment is accurate, not Deng Xiaopinga€™ s. In a country 
with stable institutions, Denga€™ s belief that the people support governments that deliver 
economic growth and punish those which do not would normally be true, as was demonstrated in the 
1992 American presidential campaign. But the CCP was gravely
wounded by the Cultural Revolution, and Chen Yun has grasped that the wind of change endorsed by 
Deng is rapidly weakening the Party, an institution which already lacks legitimacy. Few in China 
know much about Marxism-Leninism today or care what Denga€™ s a€oesocialism with Chinese 
characteristicsa€D means. The traditional Leninist party is increasingly irrelevant to economic 
life and, as the Tiananmen episode showed, its monopoly of power is
unacceptable to many in a China that is undergoing economic reform and opening up to other 
countries. The CCP, if it continues on its present course, is unlikely to long outlast the Long 
March generation of leaders.

That is why the remaining leftists will continue to try to mobilize the silent minority of older 
state employees, and to subvert some of the reformers, in order to regain control of their Party 
and change its policies, and so preserve the threatened values summarized in the four cardinal 
principles. The Fourteenth Congress can be seen as a battlefield in which Deng and his faction had 
a formidable success, but the victora€™ s successors still have to win the peace. If
they are to stay in power they will have to be prepared to sacrifice their commitments to the old 
a€oesocialista€n values in order to permit China to continue to change and prosper. Communism in 
China will probably end not with a bang but a whimper.

controversy surrounding The Tide of History.

In January this year, Premier Li Peng had asked for Bao Tonga€™ s formal arrest, and this took 
place in February. But Lia€™ s PSC colleagues reserved their views on Bao Tonga€™ s fate, knowing 
that Deng would have to have the last word on so sensitive an issue. In May, Qiao Shi, the PSC 
member in charge of public security, circulated a note to his colleagues saying that Bao Tonga€™ s 
case should probably be settled within the Party rather than by
formal trial. Both General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Li Peng drew circles opposite their names on 
the memo, the CCP way of signifying assent, probably because of the implications of Denga€™ s 
southern tour. Unexpectedly, Denga€™ s office intervened to say that Bao Tong was a bad person and 
should be punished. And so he was. On July 21, after a a€oetriala€D lasting less than six hours, 
Bao Tong was sentenced to seven years for leaking state secrets; in
fact he did no more than give a few junior colleagues three daysa€™ advance notice of the 
declaration of martial law. As for Zhao Ziyang, the Politburo confirmed its condemnation of him in 
1989, but formally put an end to any further examination of his case. (He continues under effective 
house arrest but has some freedom of movement.)

A more critical decision by Deng concerned the fate of Premier Li Peng. While allowing Zhaoa€™ s 
return might reasonably have been seen as a gesture in favor of reform and not as reversing the 
regimea€™ s verdicts on the Tiananmen Square massacre, the simultaneous removal of Li Peng, the 
front man for the hard-liners who suppressed the students with tanks, would have given immense 
encouragement to a far wider constituency than the authors of The
Tide of History. In August, Deng apparently decided that there had been enough turbulence at the 
top levels of government and that the balanced team of Jiang Zemin and Li Peng should be kept in 
power, at least for the present.

Li Peng has been on his best behavior for some time, concentrating on economics and paying 
lip-service to reform. He learned the hard way after Tiananmen that it would be immensely damaging 
economically, and therefore politically, to try to turn the clock back to the Stalinist command 
economy model. Lia€™ s ability to run the Chinese economy is widely derided in Beijing. But at 
least under his premiership, the price system has been given greater
flexibility and there have been privatizing reforms in the real estate market which, earlier this 
year, have resulted in the leasing of 1,500 parcels of state land for rents totaling over three 
billion yuan. Local governments see the new policy as a major source of revenue and foreign 
exchange in the years ahead; the new island province of Hainan, for example, has leased an area of 
seventeen square kilometers to a Japanese corporation, which will have total control of
the  land and its use for seventy years, except for policing.

After much debate, stock markets have also been opened in Shanghai and Shenzhen. In August, there 
was a large-scale riot in Shenzhen by would-be stock purchasers who felt they were not being 
allowed a fair chance to invest and who attacked government property and police. It was the 
reformist vice-premier, Zhu Rongji, not Li Peng, according to Chinese sources, who then floated the 
idea that the Shenzhen exchange be closed for a cooling-off period. Deng
Xiaoping, whose earlier praise of the progress in Shenzhen had been made to look overenthusiastic, 
vetoed the idea. No more embarrassments could be allowed to mar the preparations of the Fourteenth 
Congress.

Fortunately for Deng, the Shenzhen riot was soon over. His position was strengthened by the booming 
economy, largely the result of the changes he has presided over during the past fourteen years, and 
by his 1992 campaign. Chinaa€™ s GNP grew 12 percent in the first half of 1992, and on the eve of 
the Congress, Chinese economists were predicting 10 percent growth for the entire year, as compared 
with 7 percent in 1991. The result was closer to Denga€™ s
target of 12 percent than Li Penga€™ s of 6 percent. Industrial output had gone up 17.5 percent by 
the end of June, with the most spectacular increases being registered in the nonstate sectors, and 
the summer harvest was the best in history. During the first half of 1992, foreign investors made 
commitments worth $14.6 billion, over 300 percent more than in 1991, and foreign trade, at $68.7 
billion, was up over 20 percent. ChinaaC™ s foreign exchange reserves,
about equal to those of the US last year, are predicted to top $50 billion this year.
