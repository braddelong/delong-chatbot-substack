deployed-and-diffused worldwide (not just in the southern part of one small island) doubling every generation—that humanity was on the way to solving the problem of baking, a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to potentially have <em><strong>enough</strong></em>. But finding the solution to that problem did not get us very far, because the problems of slicing and tasting the pie—of equitably distributing it, and of utilizing our wealth so humans could live, lives in which they were safe and secure, and healthy and happy—continue to completely flummox us. And I offer explanations and stories about that flummoxing.</p><p>Kevin, however, says <em><strong>of course</strong></em><strong> </strong>the problems of slicing and tasting continue to flummox us. That is simply the human condition:</p><blockquote><p>We have… a thin layer of cognition that allows us to gossip… and solve differential equations… [that] lives on top of millions of years of primate evolution….</p><ul><li><p>We are territorial.</p></li><li><p>We are patriarchal.</p></li><li><p>We are hierarchical.</p></li><li><p>We are addicted to dominance displays.</p></li><li><p>We are tribal.</p></li></ul><p>So just as always, after 1870 we continued to have stupid wars… base our social structures on racism and tribalism…. be seduced by charismatic (male) leaders… do stupid things….</p><p>Brad… thinks something should have changed in 1870 and he's disappointed that it didn't happen…. I, on the other hand, think that nothing special should have happened just because we got better at inventing things. And it didn't. We just continued on our sloppy way…. Still, we've made progress on all these things. Not a lot, but what do you expect in only a few hundred years? This is why, for example, I think that our current MAGA-inflected politics is a pothole, not a roadmap for the future. We'll get over it.</p><p>As for economics in general, you all know what I think: in another 20 or 30 years we will have cheap, genuine artificial intelligence. <em>That</em> will be a breakpoint in human history and will make all our current arguments moot. Practically any economic disagreement you can think of simply makes no sense in a world dominated by robots and AI. But we should keep arguing anyway. After all, I might be wrong about AI.</p></blockquote><p>I think that Kevin has accurately put his thumb on our disagreement: I see the Singularity in our past (cf. Shalizi &lt;<a href="http://bactra.org/weblog/699.html">http://bactra.org/weblog/699.html</a>&gt;). Kevin sees the Singularity in our future. </p><p>I say: Up until 1870 there was no possibility of humanity baking a sufficiently large economic pie. Hence the foundation of politics and governments had to be an élite elbowing competitors out of the way and running a force-and-fraud exploitation game on the rest of humanity so that the élite of thugs-with-spears and their tame accountants, bureaucrats, and propagandists could have <em><strong>enough</strong></em>. After 1870 it was clear that things could be very different. And yet, while they were different, they were not different enough—so we are at best slouching towards utopia.</p><p>Kevin says: The sufficiently arge economic pie will not be here until 2050. And then we will see. What comes after will be marvelous and strange, but not the same-old same-old of history.</p><p>He might be right. But I think that the past gap is, psychologically, greater than the future one. I see the bit dealhumanity’s passage to a state in which for many of us we no longer spend much of our day thinking how hungry we are and plotting how the get more calories, and no longer see half our babies die before five. I see that as bigger than the leap to the Robotoverse. </p><p>Consider: we upper-middle-class Californians—Kevin Drum and I—are already largely in the Robotoverse: we are unconstrained by material necessity in finding enough food that we are not hungry, enough shelter that we are not wet (or sunburned), enough clothing that we are not cold. Lacking access to information and entertainment is just not a thing for us. </p><p>It is true that our personal Robotoverse is not made (entirely) out of robots: large pieces of it are made up of poorer people than us, both nearby and elsewhere, coordinated by the global market economy. </p><p>Yet how is our personal experience different from what Kevin envisions will be here after 2050?</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/a-thoughtful-and-critical-review?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/a-thoughtful-and-critical-review?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Must Listen:</h2><p>The best thing I have found to catch up on Muscovy’s attempt to dismantle Ukraine:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ezra Klein &amp; Andrea Kendall-Taylor</strong>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/23/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-andrea-kendall-taylor.html">Why Russia Is Losing Steam and Ukraine Is Gaining Ground</a>: ‘When Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the question most analysts were asking was not whether Russia would win.

About half the book is on how people working in the GOP became like this, but a short version goes like this: There was a big disconnect between what GOP party elites wanted and what their voters wanted. So, to do well in GOP politics, you had to do a certain amount of pretending when it came to cultural issues. That kind of pretending becomes muscle memory. Then a buffoon like Trump takes over the party, and rather than fall back on whatever principles once got them into politics, people just keep on pretending—and then they become resentful not at Trump, but at the people who call them out on it…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 25% off a group subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48"><span>Get 25% off a group subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donate Subscriptions&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true"><span>Donate Subscriptions</span></a></p><div class="install-substack-app-embed"><img class="install-substack-app-embed-img" src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png"><div class="install-substack-app-embed-text"><div class="install-substack-app-header">Read Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality in the Substack app</div><div class="install-substack-app-text">Available for iOS and Android</div></div><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_context=author-post-insert" target="_blank" class="install-substack-app-embed-link"><button class="install-substack-app-embed-btn button primary">Get the app</button></a></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
