•  Robert Kuttner: Free Markets, Besieged Citizens: a€~Gary Gerstle: The Rise and Fall of the 
Neoliberal Order: America and the World in the Free Market Era^\. The neoliberal credo claims that 
markets work efficiently and that government attempts to constrain them via regulation and public 
spending invariably fail, backfire, or are corrupted by politicsa€!. Neoliberalism has relied on 
deregulation, privatization, weakened trade unions, less
progressive taxation, and new trade rulesa€!. These shifts have resulted in widening inequality, 
diminished economic security, and reduced confidence in the ability of government to aid its 
citizens. The Republican embrace of this doctrine is hardly surprisinga€! [but] the allure of 
neoliberalism to many Democrats is a puzzle worth exploringa€!. As a dissenting remnant of 
pre-Keynesian economics, neoliberalism languished until the New Deal
model faltered in the 1970s with the improbable combination of inflation and stagnationa€!. Gerstle 
explains how the cultural left also found the libertarian and antibureaucratic aspects of 
neoliberalism appealing, weakening the New Deal order and its political coalition in yet another 
waya€!. Neoliberalism not only protects the market from the regulatory state; more radically, it 
expands market principles to realms thought to be partially sociala€!.
Was it a success or a failure? That depends on who you are. For economic elites and the Republican 
Party, it has been a splendid success. For the Democratic Party, the neoliberal order has been a 
catastrophea€l

Roosevelta€™ s program was not merely to put Americans back to work, but to save democracy. He and

AJs:

A very nice review of Koyama and Rubina€™ s new book by young whippersnapper Davis Kedrosky. I have 
the standard complaints that their emphases are not mine, but those are standard. The one 
perhaps-substantial bone I would pick is that I think that they have the hierarchical order of 
importance of the components of the Great Transformation reversed. For me, the biggest deal is the 
circa-1870 coming of Modern Economic Growth. The 1770-1870 British
surge into the Industrial Revolution, while an essential prerequisite, was a smaller deal. The 
1600-1770 a€oeLittle Divergencea€D rise of northwest Europe is a smaller deal even still, but even 
that is, I think, of much more importance than any 800-1600 a€oeGreat Divergencea€D between Europe 
and Asia. Caravels and gunpowder weapons turn out to be very important for political-imperial 
reasons, yes; but they are not the meat and fish of civilizational
advance, were quickly transferable, and gunpowder empires across Eurasia as of 1600 look, to me at 
least, much of a piece:

Davis Kedrosky: Book Review: How the World Became Rich'. a€~Mark Koyama and Jared Rubin 
chttps://www.howtheworldbecamerich.com/home> have written what will almost certainly become a 
beloved economic history classica€!. I put another book on pause to read it. As a manic 
completionist, I never do this, but once I had peeked past the blue-girded front cover I couldna€™ 
t put it down. Now Ia€™ ve read it twice. So it
goesa€!. The first [part] is a literature review of the five main strands ofa€! the New Historical 
Economics. The second isa€! a literature reviewa€! ofa€! [the] a€oerise of the westa€Da€l and 
covers the medieval preconditions for European growth, Britaina€™ s takeoff, and the spread of the 
Industrial Revolution to the global peripherya€!. Geography, institutions, culture, demography, and 
colonialisma€!. Geographya€! K&R
downplay thesea€!. K&R also take umbrage with the Wrigley-Pomeranz-Allen axis on the 
indispensability of coal to the Industrial Revolution^!. K&R are making a meta-argument resembling 
Robert Brenner (1976)a€™ s explanation for why the impact of the fourteenth-century demographic 
crises differed to the east and west of the River Elbea€!. We know the partial effects of lots of 
things in the abstract, but unless we control for
context-specific characteristics^!. Demography (e.g. the European Marriage Pattern) is treated 
similarly to geography; only in combination with institutional or cultural forces can beneficient 
changes in birth rates stimulate growtha€!. Institutions and culturea€! show up as universal 
solventsa€! limited government and the protection of property rights tend to be globally good, and 
sometimes decisive in the shift to sustained growtha€!.
For a short work, the coverage is fantastica€!. As befits a Jared Rubin book, the section on 
culture is also particularly weightya€!. The authors have little patience for theoriesa€! according 
colonialism a decisive role in promoting Western economic growth. They argue that the negative 
effects of European expansion abroad came after the onset of the Great Divergence^I. A theory of 
development is just what K&R attempt in the
booka€™ s second halfa€!. Europea€™ s Great Divergencea€! Northwest Europea€™ s Little 
Divergencea€! Britaina€™ s surgea€!. Europe had two advantagea€! a landmass a€cefractureda€Da€! 
creating several a€cecorea€D regions that could be dominated by separate polities; anda€! some 
distance from the steppea€!. In the late-medieval city-statesa€! the rent-seeking of municipal 
oligarchs and the a€oelow technological
basea€D of the period curtailed the efflorescencea€!. [In] the forward surge of the Anglo-Dutch 
commercial kingdomsa€! the emergence of limited government, specifically parliamentsa€!. The 
situation becomes more complex when the authors have to explain Britaina€™ s divergence from the 
Dutch. Why did Dutch institutions follow the medieval Italian city-states into rent-seeking and 
decay, but Britain establish a stable alliance
between mercantile, industrial, and landed power under the aegis of a powerful parliamentary 
state?a€! Wea€™re told that the Dutch also suffered from heavy war taxes, which is truea€”but 
Britain also boasted a fearsome and often regressive tax regime that funneled enormous sums into 
military spendinga€!. Ultimately, K&R take a reasonable tack. Many countries shared one or two 
advantages with Britain, but in hindsight, she
appeared to have all of thema€!. On to the spread of development. K&R favor human capital-based 
explanations for the Second Industrial Revolution^!
