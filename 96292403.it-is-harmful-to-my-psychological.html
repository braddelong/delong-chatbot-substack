I have not been doing my job for twenty years. Yet I do not apologize for drawing my paycheck and holding onto my job:</p><blockquote><p><strong>David Brooks: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/11/opinion/republican-party-future.html">The Party’s Over for Us. Where Do We Go Now?</a>: ‘By the early 2000s, I came to believe that the free market policies that were right to combat stagnation and sclerosis a few decades earlier were not right for an age of inequality and social breakdown. Then the congressional Republicans began to oppose almost every positive federal good, even George W. Bush’s compassionate conservatism...</p></blockquote><p>Do you think that maybe <em><strong>doing your job</strong></em> required <em><strong>telling your readers</strong></em> back at the time, in the early 2000s, <em><strong>that neoliberal supply-side conservatism was played out</strong></em>? Do you think that maybe <em><strong>doing your job</strong></em> required <em><strong>telling your readers</strong></em> back at the time, in the early 2000s, <em><strong>that “compassionate conservatism” was very weak and unsatisfactory tea</strong></em>?<em><strong> </strong></em>What conception of “doing your job” do you have that does not include doing those two things in the early 2000s?</p><blockquote><p><strong>David Brooks: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/11/opinion/republican-party-future.html">The Party’s Over for Us. Where Do We Go Now?</a>: ‘In the 2000 Republican primaries I enthusiastically supported John McCain. I believed in his approach to governance and I admired him enormously. But by 2008, when he got the nomination, the party had shifted and McCain had shifted along with it. I walked into the polling booth that November genuinely not knowing if I would vote for McCain or Barack Obama. Then an optical illusion flashed across my brain. McCain and Obama’s names appeared to be written on the ballot in 12-point type. But Sarah Palin’s name looked like it was written in red in 24-point type. I don’t think I’ve ever said this publicly before, but I voted for Obama…</p></blockquote><p>Do you think that maybe <em><strong>doing your job</strong></em> required <em><strong>telling your readers</strong></em> back at the time, in 2008, <em><strong>that Sarah Palin was a dealbreaker for you, and that you had voted for Obama-Biden</strong></em>? What conception of “doing your job” do you have?</p><blockquote><p><strong>David Brooks: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/11/opinion/republican-party-future.html">The Party’s Over for Us. Where Do We Go Now?</a>: ‘I wish we had taken that Buchanan victory [in the 1992 Republican New Hampshire primary] more seriously, since it was a precursor of what was to come. I wish we had pivoted our conservatism even faster away from (sorry) <em>Wall Street Journal</em> editorial page ideas and come up with conservative approaches to inequality, to deindustrialization, to racial disparities, etc. I wish, in other words, that our mentalities had shifted faster…</p></blockquote><p>Do you think that maybe <em><strong>doing your job</strong></em> required <em><strong>telling your readers</strong></em> sometime beforfe now <em><strong>that you wish you had, back in 1993, joined with the Rubin Wing of the Democratic Party rather than the Gingrich Wing of the Republican Party</strong></em>? What conception of “doing your job” do you have that does not include doing those two things in the early 2000s?</p><p>In fact, why didn’t you join with the Rubin Wing of the Democratic Party back in 1993, when you had some influence? We certainly could have used your influence. As it was, we were able to do enough to give America its best decade since 1955-1965. But we could have given much more if we had only been a little bit stronger.</p><p>Why didn’t you join with and work alongside us? We had very strong technocratic, reality-based arguments. And it is not that you had made a strong commitment to play for Team Republican:</p><blockquote><p><strong>David Brooks: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/11/opinion/republican-party-future.html">The Party’s Over for Us. Where Do We Go Now?</a>: ‘Even in my red-hot youth… I didn’t see myself as a Republican, just a conservative…. It’s always wrong for a writer to align too closely to a party…. Furthermore, I belong in the American tradition… Hamilton… the Whig Party and Lincoln… Theodore Roosevelt, parts of Reagan and McCain. I wasted years writing essays on how Republicans could maintain this tradition…. I think the Democrats are a better Hamiltonian home…</p></blockquote><p>When you have spent your entire career working diligently to tear down the political power of Democrats and build up the political power of Republicans, to now say “My Bad!”, and to go on drinking cocktails and chatting as usual—rather than giving all you have to the poor, shutting up, and taking up a life of anonymous service to others… I won’t say that words fail me, but I am genuinely flummoxed.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/it-is-harmful-to-my-psychological?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/it-is-harmful-to-my-psychological?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>MUST-READ: Lecture Notes DRAFT for Next Tuesday Start of “History of Economic Growth” Course:</h2><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:89988828,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/introduction-to-history-of-economic&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:47874,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;LECTURE NOTES: DAY 1: Introduction: Five Questions Surrounding the Identification of 1870 as the Hinge of History&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Let me talk for a while, and then let’s see if we can have a successful discussion here afterwards:&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-12-11T15:26:08.211Z&quot;,&quot;like_count&quot;:3,&quot;comment_count&quot;:0,&quot;bylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:16879,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Brad DeLong&quot;,&quot;previous_name&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ea5ae644-9822-4ca5-ac6b-e18c017d8fbc_1189x1208.png&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Author of Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the 20th Century (forthcoming Sep 06), sometime Deputy Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, old-school weblogger, UC Berkeley economic historian&quot;,&quot;profile_set_up_at&quot;:&quot;2021-04-22T17:45:51.845Z&quot;,&quot;publicationUsers&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:14551,&quot;user_id&quot;:16879,&quot;publication_id&quot;:47874,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;admin&quot;,&quot;public&quot;:true,&quot;is_primary&quot;:false,&quot;publication&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:47874,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;subdomain&quot;:&quot;braddelong&quot;,&quot;custom_domain&quot;:null,&quot;custom_domain_optional&quot;:false,&quot;hero_text&quot;:&quot;Economic history, economics, political economy, finance, &amp; forecasting.
