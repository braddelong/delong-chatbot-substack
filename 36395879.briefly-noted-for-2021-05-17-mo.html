Our figures give a death rate for the mostly rich countries which belong to the OECD of 1.17 times the official number. The estimated death rate for sub-Saharan Africa is 14 times the official number. And the first-and-second-wave structure seen in Europe and the United States is much less visible in the model’s figures for the world as a whole. Overall, the pandemic is increasingly concentrated in developing economies and continuing to grow…. </p><p>Demography matters a lot: more younger people typically means lower death rates. So, we inferred, do less obvious factors such as systems of government and the degree of media freedom. To take a specific example, excess deaths in Russia are 5.1 times greater than official covid deaths…. We estimate that, by May 10th, there was a 95% probability that the pandemic had brought about between 2.4m and 7.1m excess deaths in Asia (official covid–19 deaths: 0.6m), 1.5m–1.8m deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean (v 0.6m), 0–2.1m deaths in Africa (v 0.1m), 1.5m–1.6m deaths in Europe (v 1.0m) and 0.6m–0.7m deaths in America and Canada (v 0.6m)… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/05/15/there-have-been-7m-13m-excess-deaths-worldwide-during-the-pandemic">https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/05/15/there-have-been-7m-13m-excess-deaths-worldwide-during-the-pandemic</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><h2>&amp;:</h2><p>Highlighting this from two months ago.

They are Keynesians in the sense that they have the same profound and deep distrust in the laissez-faire market economy's ability to deliver macroeconomic stability. Moreover, they share the confidence John Maynard Keynes had that limited and strategic government interventions and policies could produce macroeconomic stability while still leaving enormous space for the operation of the market. Thus there are no believers in true&nbsp;<em>laissez-faire</em>&nbsp;left, at least not as far as academic macroeconomics is concerned…. </p><p>The "neutral" monetary policy advocated in works like Friedman and Schwartz (1963) turns out to be a policy that pre-Keynesian generations would have called extraordinarily activist on a number of levels.

Ago</strong>: <em>For President’s Day: A Republic, If We Can Keep It</em>: I do not know what today’s Republicans want America to be, but it is certainly not a democratic republic. And it is certainly not any form of “populism” that I am aware of. Perhaps we should classify their goal as a minority ethnocentric demogocracy? “Neofascist” still seems the best word to me, but I am told that is much, much, much too impolite to use, even on the internet: No, Alexander Hamilton was not a president. But he should have been: ’It is impossible to read the history of the petty republics of Greece and Italy without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the distractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the rapid succession of revolutions by which they were kept in a state of perpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy…. From the disorders… advocates of despotism have drawn arguments… against the forms of republican government… [and] decried all free government as inconsistent with the order of society…. I trust America will be the broad and solid foundation of other edifices… which will be… permanent monuments of their errors.

The science of politics, however… has received great improvement… distribution of power into distinct departments… balances and checks… judges holding their offices during good behavior… representation of the people… by deputies of their own election… are means, and powerful means, by which the excellences of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.bradford-delong.com/2021/02/for-presidents-day-a-republic-if-we-can-keep-it.html">https://www.bradford-delong.com/2021/02/for-presidents-day-a-republic-if-we-can-keep-it.html</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>1 Mo.

But—unless the coronavirus plague has done a lot more damage to the economic division of labor than I believe—it will not be because production and employment are in any manner above stable-inflation “potential”. Think of whatever inflation might happen as skidmarks and burning rubber, rather than any form of boilover… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/i-do-not-see-overheating-this-year">https://braddelong.substack.com/p/i-do-not-see-overheating-this-year</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>1 Mo.
