Paragraphs:

I kinda suspect this restaurant owner would have a very difficult time surviving in a world in 
which workers have at least some pricing power:

Dave Jamieson: a€™ Guy who runs restaurants wants unemployment benefits cut, seems surprised by 
stubbornness of job seekers: a€oea€~How much do you pay?a€™ thata€™ s one of the first questions out
of their moutha€D. I think that would be the first question out of my mouth, but Ia€™ m in the 
unique position of having to feed and clothe childrena€!

Am I paranoid? Or is it truly, truly the case that a critical mass of senior Republican politicians 
and activists were abused as children? That really seems to be the model they are using as they 
react to their abuse by Trump:

Paul Krugman: Republican Cowardice Endangers American Democracy: a€~Conspiracy theorizing is hardly 
a new thing in our national life; Richard Hofstadter wrote a€oeThe Paranoid Style in American
Politicsa€D back in 1964. White rage has been a powerful force at least since the civil rights 
movement. Whata€™ s different this time is the acquiescence of Republican elites. The Big Lie about 
the election
didna€™  t well up from the grass rootsa€”it was promoted from above, initially by Trump himself, 
but whata€™ s crucial is that almost no prominent Republican politicians have been willing to 
contradict his
claims and many have rushed to back them upa€!

Jeet Heer: Beatnik Phrenology: a€'Nathaniel Weyla€! wrote: a€oeThus, white Rhodesians are an elite 
element within the English-speaking world in terms of psychometric intelligence. This finding is 
reinforced by visual impressions.
Salisbury whites appear larger, healthier, more vigorous, alert and bright than London whites. 
Beatniks, transvestites and obvious homosexuals are conspicuously absenta€!a€D I dona€™ t want to 
belabour the obvious, but we are not
dealing with a scientific mind here. Yet Weyl was much admired by the National Review circle of the 
1950s and 1960s, not just by Kendall but also by William F. Buckleya€!

John Stoehr: The Senate GOP Is Ready to Block a Bipartisan Commission to Investigate the 
Insurrection. Is It Time for Filibuster Reform?: a€~While all but four Senate Republicans are 
leaning away from patriotism, Democrat Joe
Manchin is leaning into ita€!. Whatever he does, however, has to be seen as nowhere near being 
partisan. Thata€™ s why hea€™ s leaning into God and country. On hearing news of the Republicans 
preparing to block the bill, he told
reporters: a€oeSo disheartening. It makes you really concerned about our countrya€! Ia€™m still 
praying wea€™ ve still got 10 good solid patriots within that conference.a€D The hoped-for a€oelO 
good solid patriotsa€D do not
exista€!.   So we have Manchin leaning into patriotism while all but four Republicans are leaning 
away from patriotism, filibustering the legislation, probably today. At the same time, Manchin 
said, a€oeThere is no excuse for any
Republican  to vote against this commission .a€D Hell, hea€™ s got on his side the mom of a dead 
Capitol cop, who said: a€oel suggest that all congressmen and senators who are against this bill 
visit my sona€™ s gravea€D (my italics).
This   is one of those rare moments after which we might see some clarity. If therea€™ s a time to 
act on the filibuster^”in the name of God and countrya€”now might be that timea€! LINK:
