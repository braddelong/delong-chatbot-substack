Intel will spend $20 billion to build two new factories&nbsp;in Arizona, vastly expanding capacity for both internal use and for customers of its new program, called “Intel Foundry Services," or IFS…. Here’s the biggest question for the chipmaker: Can it win a large chunk of business away from market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.? During his strategy presentation, Gelsinger confirmed for the first time that the company will be using TSMC to manufacture some of its top-of-the-line CPU processors in 2023. This is a result of&nbsp;years of Intel delays in moving to the latest chipmaking technologies. With Intel compelled to use TSMC for some of its leading products, it’s going to be difficult at least in the near term for the company&nbsp;to argue that its services are significantly better than its&nbsp;Asian rival…. There are some tailwinds for Intel’s manufacturing business… security concerns… future subsidies and tax incentives from the Biden administration…. While it is easy for Intel to talk a big game about building a “world-class” foundry business, it will be much harder to create a viable and profitable one… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-07/intel-s-plan-to-take-on-tsmc-and-win-big-in-chips-has-big-risks">https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-07/intel-s-plan-to-take-on-tsmc-and-win-big-in-chips-has-big-risks</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Martin Weitzman</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Prices vs. Quantities</em>: ‘The benefit of a final good is essentially the utility which arises out of consuming the good. It could be highly curved at the optimum output level if tastes happen to be kinked at certain critical points…. Our intuitive feeling, which is confirmed by the formal analysis, is that it doesn’t pay to “fool around” with prices in such situations…. There is, it seems to me, a rather fundamental reason to believe that quantities are better signals for situations demanding a high degree of coordination. A classical example would be the short run production planning of intermediate industrial materials. Within a large production organization, be it the General Motors Corporation or the Soviet industrial sector as a whole, the need for balancing the output of any intermediate commodity whose production is relatively specialized to this organization and which cannot be effortlessly and instantaneously imported from or exported to a perfectly competitive outside world puts a kink in the benefit function. If it turns out that production of ball bearings of a certain specialized kind (plus reserves) falls short of anticipated internal consumption, far more than the value of the unproduced bearings can be lost… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/weitzman/files/prices_vs_quantities.pdf">https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/weitzman/files/prices_vs_quantities.pdf</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Dan Wang</strong>:&nbsp;<em>China, the U.S., &amp; Technology</em>: ‘The economic relationship between China and the US is massive.

Prices are constantly going up, to the point that restaurants sometimes just write menu prices on stickers, and cash isn’t really worth saving, at least not in pesos. People and businesses rush to convert their pesos to dollars because they’re aware the currency is unstable. The country has a dual exchange rate: the “official” rate and the black market rate, known as the “blue.” Right now, the official rate is about 90 pesos to the dollar, the blue is about 140. If you’re paid in dollars, it’s a good deal. If you’re paid in pesos, it sucks, and prices are going up a lot faster than wages. Consumers pay for stuff in a bunch of interest-free installments when they can because the assumption is everything will probably be way more expensive soon…. What some economists are worried about right now is that the US might be headed toward a ’70s-like period of inflation, due in large part to the federal government’s response to the pandemic, most recently President Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid–19 relief bill…. Is the worst-case scenario the likeliest scenario? In a word, no. There’s reason to stay vigilant—as policymakers say they are—but not reason to panic…. That doesn’t mean the Fed wouldn’t react if things go awry, or that Powell and Yellen might not wind up being wrong in their predictions. But doomsday isn’t the most probable scenario on the horizon, or close to it…. “Inflation has been very low for over a decade. And, you know, it’s a risk, but it’s a risk that the Federal Reserve and others have tools to address,” Yellen told CNBC in February. “The greater risk is of scarring the people, we having this pandemic take a permanent lifelong toll on their lives and livelihoods”…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22346376/inflation-rate-explained-federal-reserve">https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22346376/inflation-rate-explained-federal-reserve</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-04-18-su/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-04-18-su/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>(Remember: You can subscribe to this… weblog-like newsletter… here:&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>There’s a free email list.
