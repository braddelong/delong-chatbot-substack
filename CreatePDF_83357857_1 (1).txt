The passage is:

Things changed starting around 1870. Then we got the institutions for organization and research and 
the technologiesa€”we got full globalization, the
industrial research laboratory, and the modern corporation. These were the keys. These unlocked the 
gate that had previously kept humanity in dire poverty.
The problem of making humanity rich could now be posed to the market economy, because it now had a 
solution. On the other side of the gate, the trail to
utopia came into view. And everything else good should have followed from thata€!

Nick S. of Unfogged <http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2022_l 1 O6.html#O18157> points out:

Given the list of three key changes in the organization of human and economic life 
(a€~globalization, the industrial research lab, and the modern
corporation^™) there's minimal attention paid to the ways in which those shaped the power of 
government as well as the economy. Globalization is
certainly   political as well as technological and possibility of deglobalization is driven by 
political factors. The industrial research lab and corporation grew
in tandem with increased state capacity. It struck me, as I was writing this summary, that the 
figure cited above — that the British government was able to
mobilize 1/3 the productive capacity of the country for the war effort — is specific to the long 
20th Century (quick googling makes me think the Civil War
involved similar levels of mobilization but, I believe, prior to that state capacity was much more 
limited).

He is correct. The coming of the modern state with its organizational and regulatory capacity is a 
fourth major change around 1870, that I should not have omitted.
