Alright, here is another Mud & truck maintenance post. Look at the tires in
the video immediately under the wheel hubs.

That is oil from the wheel hubs leaking onto those tires from the hub to the
ground.

The seals on those wheel hubs have failed due to dry rot.

OUTLAWS SERIES #2: FULK FITZWARIN

When King John of England (r. 1199-1216) was a child he liked to play chess. That, at any rate, is 
the contention of the tale of Fouke le Fitz Waryn, an Old French prose romance blending fact and 
fiction, which was composed in the later thirteenth century. John, we are told, liked chess. 
Unfortunately, he also liked quarrelling. And one day, those two interests collideda€!

would be an odd coincidence for a lab-leaked virus to have its first big super-spreading event at a

Ia€™ m not convinced by the new lab leak debunking

The mediaa€™ s lab leak fiasco is the most-read Slow Boring post of all time. The piece, which ran 
back in May 2021, reviewed some poor coverage decisions from February and March 2020 in which the 
media conflated a wild conspiracy theory (Covid-19 was caused by a Chinese bioweapon) with a 
plausible hypothesis (Covid-19 was caused by a lab accident), asserted that Tom Cotton was pushing 
the wild conspiracy theory, and proclaimed natural origins
for Covid-19 with massive overconfidencea€!

Paragraphs:

Jeff Troutner: Shameful Behavior Ignored'. a€~Cathie Wooda€!. On January 14, Jason Zweig of The 
Wall Street Journal wrote about the extraordinary rise and fall of Wooda€™ s ARK Innovation 
funda€!. Zweig gave the article a cute title: a€oeHow a Flood of Money Swamped Cathie Wooda€™ s 
ARK.a€Ua€! Over the first two calendar years of ARKKa€™ s existence, the fund produced a cumulative 
return of only 2%. Then Ms. Wood got lucky. In 2017
the fund rose an amazing 87% (fueled mostly by her largest single holding, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, 
which soared 1,600% that year)a€!. Woods also struggled in 2018 with a gain of only 4%. But in 2019 
the fund jumped 36% and assets almost doubled to a still-modest $1.9 billion. Then COVIDa€‘T9 hit. 
And her highly concentrated, speculative portfolio soared 157% in 2020. Did she know Anthony Fauci 
and possess some insider knowledge of what was
going on at the Wuhan Institute of Virology? Not likely. She simply gambled with a billion or two 
of her investorsa€™ money and hit the jackpot when the world went into lockdown. By the end of 
2020, as word of Cathie Wooda€™ s a€oeunique geniusaCD for recognizing profitable innovation became 
more widely known, a flood of new money moved into her fund and instantly made her extremely 
wealthy. Then the bottom fell out. Since early February
2021, the price of Wooda€™ s ETF has crashed 60%a€!. So how does Jason Zweig feel about this? When 
you title your article a€ceHow a Flood of Money Swamped Cathie Wooda€™ s ARK,a€D you immediately 
shift blame from Wooda€™ s poor management and questionable stock buying and selling skills to 
investors making the classic mistake of trying to a€oebuy past performancea€Da€!

Harold James: Gold Fetishism Has Had Its Day: a€~People often mistakenly see money as an 
asseta€”thata€™ s the old fetishism. But money represents a value, one that needs to be earned. 
What ultimately makes a currency secure is credibility: the confidence of others. That will depend 
on whether a government observes laws and conventions. Money isna€™ t a shared illusion. It is 
rather a series of agreements and customs among and within countries.
Violating some of those agreements can shatter the rest, destroying the privilege of money. A 
massive violation of norms can produce a massive loss of value. And a fortress of reserves offers 
no protection^!

Ryan Avent: Making Economic Policy as if Democracy Matters: a€~America had two extraordinary 
opportunities to design and implement its vision of a global order, in the aftermath of the second 
world wara€! and then again after the fall of communisma€!. That western Europe and Japan would 
become reliably peaceful, prosperous, and democratic places was certainly not something that could 
be taken for granted 75 years agoa€!. Seeing off the Soviet
threat without plunging the world into nuclear war was also a significant achievement, as was 
reestablishing an open global economya€!. But if you had told the architects of the postwar order 
that while veterans of the second world war still lived, and despite the collapse of the Soviet 
Union and the seeming failure of communism, Europe would see another war of territorial 
aggrandizement by a would-be emperor, while a tide of authoritarianism rose as
democracies wobbled, I think they would agree that something had gone badly wronga€!

resistance both fierce and effective. It would be nice to think that Vladimir Putin, having

Trent Telenko: Mud & Truck Maintenance: a€™ Look closely at these photos NOT at the destroyed tank, 
but the road under it. That road will fall apart under the weight of heavily loaded supply trucks 
after that tank is removed. There have been hundreds of such explosively destroyed & burned out 
fighting vehicles on the roads to the Ukrainian cities Russia wants to conquer. More and more road 
bed is going to be structurally destroyed by intense, hours long,
heat of ammunition cook off. This is the attrition of war hitting Ukrainian roads that the road 
bound due to the Raputisa & bad tire maintenance Russian trucks have to use. One of the things that 
I was looking for in the build up of Russian forces around Ukraine was the stockpiles of sand, 
gravel and pre-made concrete structures to extensive road repair & maintenance required for 
extended mechanized combat operations. Captured Russian Army documents
make clear Putina€™ s generals planned a three day a€oespecial operationa€D so they did not lay on 
the civil engineering supplies to support the road maintenance needed for artillery-heavy 
mechanized combat operations. Videos of the Russian Army 2nd strategic echelon movements that 
Putina€™ s generals didna€™ t think they would need are STILL not showing any of the civil 
engineering supplies necessary for the war they have. We should be seeing
Russian civilian dump trucks filled with road building materials, flatbed semi-tractor trailers 
with pre-made culverts and excavators being staged in large numbers. There just arena€™ t any. This 
strongly suggest to me that Putina€™ s generals are on a very short economic clock regards how long 
Russia can fund combat operations. Think six to 10 weeks of high intensity mechanized combat 
operations. Being on a€oesand & gravel watcha€D was not on my
bingo  card for 2022a€!

Subject: Teaching Data Science: Once Again, We Are Defeateda€!

I find myself, once again, profoundly disappointed with my attempts to write data-science exercises 
for my economic history classes: Python Exercise: B. Malthusian Economies: (due 2022-03-27 Su) 
<https://mvbinder.org/v2/gh/braddelong/22-iupvter-ps02/HEAD>
The image in my mind of what I want to do is clear. Let me quote myself:

A couple of years ago, I had coffee with a student who had graduated in 2007, and who attributed a 
large chunk of the interesting and successful career he has had in the past 
decade-and-a-halfa€’’had in spite of the collapse of the job market in 2008-9a€”to the fact that he 
had been fluent in Microsoft Office when he left Berkeley. But now, he saida€”and I agreea€”it is 
no longer fluency in Word, Powerpoint, and (shudder) Excel that
allows one to make oneself useful in a white-collar organization doing interesting work while one 
learns-by-doing. Rather, it is fluency in a language like Python, and the ability to script hooks 
into various Big Data and other APIs.

An analogy: Back in the medieval European university, people would learn the 7r/v/uma€”the 
'trivial' subjects of Grammar (how to write), Rhetoric (how to speak in public), and Logic (how to 
think coherently)a€”then they would learn the Quadrivium of Arithmetic, Geometry, Music/Harmony, 
and Astronomy/Astrology; and last they would learn the advanced and professional subjects: Law or 
Medicine or Theology and Physics,
Metaphysics, and Moral Philosophy.

But a student would also learn two more things:

1. How to learn by readinga€”how to take a book and get something useful out of it, without a 
requiring a direct hands-on face-to-face teacher

2. How to write ^fine chancery hand, so that they could prepare their own documents, for submission 
to secular courts or to religious bishops (or even just put them in a form where they would be 
easily legible to any educated audience back in Those Days).

In 1999 Python programming language creator Guido van Rossem compared the ability to read, write, 
and use software you had built or modified yourself to search and analyze data and information 
collections. Guido predicted that mass programming, if it could be attained, would produce 
increases in societal power and changes in societal organization of roughly the same magnitude as 
mass literacy has had over the past several
centuries. Guido may be right, and he may be wrong. But what is clear is that your fives may be 
richer, and you may have more options, if the data science and basic programming intellectual tools 
become a useful part of your intellectual panoplies.

Thus the Data Science tools may well turn out to be in the first half of the 2000s the equivalent 
of ^fine chancery hand, just as a facility with the document formats and commands of the Microsoft 
office suite were the equivalent of a fine chancery hand at the end of the 1900s: practical, 
general skills that make you of immense value to most if not nearly all organizations.
Why Jupyter and Python, rather than R-Studio and R, or C++ and MATLAB, or even Office? Because 
Jupyter Project founder Fernando Perez has an office on the fourth floor of Evans. Because half of 
Berkeley undergraduates currently take Data 8 and so, taking account of other channels, more than 
half of Berkeley students are already going to graduate literate in python.

Yet I am finding over and over again that I cannot write exercises that are (a) substantively 
interesting (I think) about the topics of economic history, (b) doable in reasonable time without 
much more handholding than our appallingly bad teacher-student ratio here at Berkeley allows by 
those who do not have programming experience, and (c) interesting as programming exercises for 
those who have.
So I have dropped (c)a€! **Sigh**
