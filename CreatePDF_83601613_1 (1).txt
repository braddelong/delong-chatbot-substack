The passage:

No: [von Hayeka€™ s] a€oeThe market giveth, the market taketh away; blessed be the name of the 
marketa€D was not a stable principle around which to
organize society and political economy. The only stable principle had to be some version of 
[Polanyia€™ s] a€oeThe market was made for man, not man
for the market.a€n But who were the men who counted for whom the market should be made? And what 
version would be the best making? And how to
resolve the squabbles over the answers to those questions?

As Arthur Goldhammer has pointed out to me, this really needs a reference to and some discussion of 
the a€oea€~varieties of capitalisma€™ literature stemming from the seminal
work of Hall and Soskicea€D. Plus more discussion of the evolving European Union as a a€oelocus of 
the postwar praxis (as opposed to the intellectual history) of politics vs.
marketsa€D would strengthen the book.

Comparative Advantage (New York: Oxford University Press: 0199247749)
