And she said there’s been zero contact with the Democratic leader since the election: ‘He has not spoken to me, no.’ “Should we let Susan Collins make the bill substantially worse, or just go ahead and pass a better one” is not actually a hard question if those are the choices. And in terms of what this might mean going forward, I assume Schumer has also realized that, as his predecessor allegedly remarked, Collins “is always there for a vote you don’t need.”… [Now] even relatively moderate Democrats [are willing] to ignore Republican pleas to spend months and months negotiating before Susan Collins can announce that, in fact, her shop has no cheese at all and she was deliberately wasting your time… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2021/03/chuck-schumer-no-longer-interested-in-playing-3-card-monte-with-susan-collins">https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2021/03/chuck-schumer-no-longer-interested-in-playing-3-card-monte-with-susan-collins</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>I have long wondered whether individuals who write to inform their readers might be able to acquire enough a brand to disintermediate newspapers and such that really work for their reporters’ sources, and when they don’t work for their sources work for their bosses, and when they don’t work for their sources or their bosses work for their advertisers. SubStack is once again launching the project of finding out why this might become so into the breach:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Elizabeth Spiers</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Blogs vs. Substack vs. Legacy Media</em>: ‘Self-publishing on Substack is good for people who want to write commentary. And there’s no chance of ever cannibalizing op-ed writers from journalism because there’s just no shortage of people who want to be op-ed writers. But it mostly works well for people who already have a bit of a brand, either because they’ve written somewhere else or they’ve already built up an audience from scratch–and the latter is really hard to do. But if you can do it, the upsides of self-publishing are that you can write about whatever you want with no institutional or stylistic constraints. I write for traditional outlets like the Washington Post as well as on my personal Substack, but I have to pitch everything and I hate pitching. There are some pieces I’d rather just write on spec than write 450 words explaining what the piece is. And sometimes I get rejections and want to write those pieces anyway, if only for myself.

Vernon Henderson, Tim L. Squires, Adam Storeygard, &amp; David N.

We first document that nearly half of the variation can be explained by a parsimonious set of physical geography attributes. A full set of country indicators only explains a further 10%. When we divide geographic characteristics into two groups, those primarily important for agriculture and those primarily important for trade, we find that the agriculture variables have relatively more explanatory power in countries that developed early and the trade variables have relatively more in countries that developed late, despite the fact that the latter group of countries are far more dependent on agriculture today. We explain this apparent puzzle in a model in which two technological shocks occur, one increasing agricultural productivity and the other decreasing transportation costs, and in which agglomeration economies lead to persistence in urban locations. In countries that developed early, structural transformation due to rising agricultural productivity began at a time when transport costs were still relatively high, so urban agglomerations were localized in agricultural regions. When transport costs fell, these local agglomerations persisted. In late developing countries, transport costs fell well before structural transformation. To exploit urban scale economies, manufacturing agglomerated in relatively few, often coastal, locations. With structural transformation, these initial coastal locations grew, without formation of more cities in the agricultural interior… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22145/w22145.pdf">https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22145/w22145.pdf</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Boris Johnson has set his credibility on fire, and has no potential allies anywhere in the world for whatever he wants to do on international diplomacy or economic policy.

Middle-ranking and smaller states seek… sheltering behind alliances, coalitions of the like-minded and multilateral rules. A long-promised foreign, diplomatic and intelligence strategy soon to be unveiled by Boris Johnson’s government must start from this simple premise…. International networks rest on mutual trust. Nations, like individuals, abide by the rules to the extent that others also act in good faith. Unreliable partners do not get to act as conveners. Which renders all the more inexplicable Johnson’s efforts to renege on the Brexit agreement he signed with the EU. The government’s move to delay implementation of agreed new checks on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland recalls a threat last year to repudiate the customs arrangements designed to avoid a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland…. Such things are noticed. Witness the remarks of Brendan Boyle, a congressional ally of US president Joe Biden. This was the second time, Boyle told BBC television’s Newsnight, “that this UK government has signed up to an international agreement and then immediately decided to go back on what it agreed to”. The move carried “all sorts of ramifications”. One of which could be a serious falling out with Washington.

People like stupid me kept pointing out that this was ridiculous as you could just start replacing the water/sewer systems in most of the country. Keynes’s “pay people to dig holes in the ground and then fill them up,” but actually useful and needed!… The rescue bill has quietly become an infrastructure bill. It devotes $350 billion to supporting state and local governments. These funds, initially proposed to plug COVID–19-created holes in public budgets, in many cases now exceed those holes. So the Senate has allowed states, cities, and counties to spend that money on imteproving services such as water, sewage, and broadband. Because many water systems are vulnerable to climate change and must be adapted, this is de facto climate funding. The bill also contains $31 billion for tribal governments and Indigenous communities, including line items for new infrastructure, housing, and language preservation.
