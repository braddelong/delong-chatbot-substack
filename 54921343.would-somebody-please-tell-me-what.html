Frankly, the Fed kind of dropped the ball on inflation. They were too slow to react last year and should have started moving to tighter money sooner. But what’s past is past, and now the Fed has to thread the needle and bring inflation back down without triggering a recession. Fortunately, Powell has acknowledged his oversight and the Fed raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point last week, with six more rate hikes expected in 2022…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:52294719,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.slowboring.com/p/fait-accompli&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:159185,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Slow Boring &quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec696af9-c7e4-4f1d-a582-6c0e5beffe69_768x768.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The problem with flexible average inflation targeting&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;You may not have noticed at the time, given everything else going on in the world, but back in August of 2020, something very important happened: Jay Powell gave a speech in which he announced that the Federal Reserve had updated its strategic framework&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-05-14T10:00:30.594Z&quot;,&quot;like_count&quot;:38,&quot;comment_count&quot;:49,&quot;bylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:27698852,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Milan Singh&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/44de0e96-d2c4-45eb-8976-23be9114bcd4_1700x1700.jpeg&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Incumbent intern at Slow Boring and incoming freshman at Yale, currently taking a gap year.

Households have a huge buildup in savings &lt;<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Lo1j">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Lo1j</a>&gt;, and spending this down is no doubt contributing to demand.&nbsp;Conceptually, one might expect these demand pressures to be captured by the unemployment rate…. One thing that hasn’t contributed much to inflation so far is an unhinging of longer run inflation expectations…. Market expectations are predicated on what the market expects the Fed to do. There is a self-fulfilling prophecy element in this, as in many things in macroeconomics. So long as the market expects the Fed will do what it takes to contain inflation, we won’t see much movement in longer run inflation expectations.&nbsp; The Fed is working very hard to preserve this.

All competent macroeconomists agree that there is a positive natural rate of inflation: we have high costs of nominal wage cuts in terms of the destruction of worker-boss trust, very high costs of bankruptcy workouts, and very very sticky nominal debts. Given those institutional-structural features of the economy, a positive natural rate of inflation to grease the gears of the labor market and of the debt market is an inescapable necessity. But how high is the natural rate of inflation in normal times? And how does it alter in times of supply shocks and of sectoral-rebalancing demand shocks? Not enough economists have spent not enough time on these issues.</p><p>My view is that there is no—none—zero—case for not accommodating supply and sectoral-rebalancing shocks until they threaten to destabilize long-run inflation expectations. After they threaten to do so, there is a trade-off to be dealt with. Before they threaten to do so, there is not.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/would-somebody-please-tell-me-what?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/would-somebody-please-tell-me-what?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Image:</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c12e8b4-ea8f-4ce2-ac50-9cb73f8c2de8_834x410.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c12e8b4-ea8f-4ce2-ac50-9cb73f8c2de8_834x410.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c12e8b4-ea8f-4ce2-ac50-9cb73f8c2de8_834x410.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c12e8b4-ea8f-4ce2-ac50-9cb73f8c2de8_834x410.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c12e8b4-ea8f-4ce2-ac50-9cb73f8c2de8_834x410.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1c12e8b4-ea8f-4ce2-ac50-9cb73f8c2de8_834x410.png" width="834" height="410" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c12e8b4-ea8f-4ce2-ac50-9cb73f8c2de8_834x410.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:410,&quot;width&quot;:834,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:268016,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c12e8b4-ea8f-4ce2-ac50-9cb73f8c2de8_834x410.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c12e8b4-ea8f-4ce2-ac50-9cb73f8c2de8_834x410.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c12e8b4-ea8f-4ce2-ac50-9cb73f8c2de8_834x410.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c12e8b4-ea8f-4ce2-ac50-9cb73f8c2de8_834x410.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>mmhmm</strong>: <em>Introducing mmhmm for Web</em> &lt;<a href="https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=ROuKrzETRuc">https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=ROuKrzETRuc</a>&gt;: </p><div id="youtube2-ROuKrzETRuc" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;ROuKrzETRuc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ROuKrzETRuc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay;

My quip in response was that he was too much “be clever” and too little model-building, and that you needed—as Harry Johnson once said—to offer a straightforward path to work your <em><strong>epigones</strong></em> could do, like estimating another money-demand function, or considering another form of monopolistic-like competition in international trade. But John Maynard Keynes was also too much “be clever” and too little model-building, and that did not hurt him. Indeed, “mathing up Keynes”, as Larry Summers likes to put it, has been perhaps the largest productive sector in macroeconomics for going on 80 years now. So what gives with Galbraith?</p><p>Now an astute young economist—many astute young economists—could devote themselves to “mathing up” <em>The Affluent Society</em> and The New Industrial State chapter-by-chapter. Indeed, that people are is one reading of pieces of the behavioral-economics and imperfect-competition threads of articles appearing in journals today.</p><p>Fifteen years ago I said that three things had robbed Galbraith of his political-economy relevance, or perhaps effectiveness: (a) the faded memory of the Great Depression meant that the middle class and high-wire entrepreneurs had forgotten that they and the working class had common interests in the New Deal order, (b) small-government neo- and paleo-liberals prevent the legislative majorities that could fuel a new New Deal or another Great Society, and (c) while the solid, racist Democratic South could be populist, the solid, racist Republican South will never be. Plus the extraordinary durability of the Horatio Alger myth means that even an economics based on solidarity rather than enterprise by rugged individuals is received by too many Americans as if it were pronounced in an incomprehensible foreign language.</p><p>And so now I am actually more hopeful than I was fifteen years ago. The rise of what Jacob Levy calls “the multiculturalism of fear” seems to me to have made America’s people more likely to understand, sympathize, and resonate with Galbraith’s message—if only they would read them.</p><p>But if even I decide that I would rather have Karl Polanyi than John Kenneth Galbraith as my rhetorical north star by which to steer, what are the chances that Galbraith’s works will get under people’s noses again to any large degree?</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Paragraphs:</strong></h2><p>A beautiful piece on a very important story. In 1500 Castile was at the center of a web of economic, political, and military forces—the conductor of an orchestra of the division of labor, power, exploitation, and accumulation that stretched from Augsburg to Peru. In 1600 it was nearly the hegemonic power in Europe. And by 1800 not only was it all gone, but Spain was much weaker than if the Spanish Seaborne Empire had never been. Why? And how? This provides a very good knife to open that oyster:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Carlos Javier Charotti &amp; </strong><em><strong>al.</strong></em>: <em>American Treasure &amp; the Decline of Spain</em>: ‘Spain was one of the world’s richest countries around 1500. Two centuries later, it was a backwater. This column discusses the long-run impact of the influx of precious metals from the New World on the economic development of Spain. Using an augmented synthetic control methodology, the authors show that in the long run the growth and price level trajectories evolved dramatically different in Spain relative to other Western European nations. Spain initially boomed but suffered from high inflation and became poorer as the result of a resource curse which had economic and political dimensions…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://voxeu.org/article/american-treasure-and-decline-spain">https://voxeu.org/article/american-treasure-and-decline-spain</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Remote work is horrible for people who do not yet have a social network with which to do their job, and bad for people who need to extend their social network to do their job. It’s only an unmitigated good for people like me, over 60, for whom the sun has clearly passed the zenith and for whom the task is not to expand but to hang on to an already existing social network. And yet the pressures for remote work’s permanence are turning out to be very strong indeed, for it turns out it is something that people with considerable social power value a lot:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Matthew Boyle</strong>: <em>Wall Street, Silicon Valley Return-to-Office Plans Unravel in Hot Job Market</em>: ‘JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. chief Jamie Dimon has been one of the most vocal critics of remote work, arguing that it’s no substitute for the spontaneous idea generation&nbsp;that results from bumping into colleagues at the coffee machine. But in his annual letter to shareholders last month, the head of America’s&nbsp;biggest bank&nbsp;allowed that working from home “will become more permanent in American business,” and estimated that about 40% of his 270,000-person workforce…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-11/wall-street-silicon-valley-return-to-office-plans-unravel-in-hot-job-market">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-11/wall-street-silicon-valley-return-to-office-plans-unravel-in-hot-job-market</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>See above: The people who do well with remote learning are also the people who can learn by simply curling up with a textbook, using it to create a sub-Turing instantiation of the mind of the author, run that sub-Turing instantiation on their wetware, and learn from it. I am one of those people. But very few of my students are. They need the connection of real, live conversation partners, and the motivation and ability to execute that comes with east-African-plains-apes-doing-things-in-groups. For most of my students, I think the past two years have been a real disaster:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Jonathan Malesic</strong>: <em>My College Students Are Not OK</em>: ‘In March 2020, essentially all of U.S. higher education went remote overnight. Faculties, course designers and educational technology staffs scrambled to move classes online, developing new techniques on the fly….

Will he end up buying the company, and, if so, how much will he end up paying?… A lot of attention has focused on the $1 billion termination fee in the short-form merger agreement. Fewer people have looked at the section on “specific performance” in the long-form merger plan that basically says: “If you try to back out of this, we can take you to court in Delaware, and the court will force you to buy the company at the agreed price.”… Such language is particularly germane in cases like this, where the buyer has the ability to pay in full….
