Recovering (Economically) from CO VID: Scenarios for After May

I see three scenarios with substantial probability mass associated with them for what happens after 
after May:

1)People conclude that we are living in a much more uncertain world than they thought before March 
2020, so they sharply raise their long-term wealth-to-income ratios, and bank rather than
spenda€”and then without 10 Republican senators for infrastructure, which we do not have, we repeat 
2010-2015 in the absence of the $1.9T...

2) A giant Mardi Gras commences in June 2021, as people react to the final scotching of the virus 
as a large systemic worry in a way that they reacted to the ending of rationing after WWII. (Cf.:
Gillian Brunet:

Gillian Brunet @gillian brunet

This past year I've thought a lot about WWII in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here is net 
private saving by HH and institutions (% of GDP) annually 1929-2020. 2020 looks a lot like
WWII...

in wages in previously shutdown sectors, but it is a healthy and warranted jump in
relative prices that does not feed through to inflation expectationsa€’’again, as after WWII. And 
we are very glad we did the $1.9T...

3) The multiplier from the $1.9% turns out to be significantly greater than Edelberg & Sheiner 
project, and the Fed needs to raise 10-year rates by 2-3%-points in order to keep the U.S. economy
from overheating significantly. And that's fine, because that normalizes interest rates, and then 
monetary policy has traction, and normal stabilization-policy governance can resume.

There is also a fourth scenario that some people give a considerable probability to:

4) Either Jay Powell turns out to be Arthur Burns, and we get into a hell of a mess, or the 
increases in interest rates required to keep the economy from overheating trigger a major financial 
crisis,
and we get into a hell of a mess. That seems to be underpinned by a belief that the Fed cannot push 
the unemployment rate up by 0.5% evera€”that whenever it tries, unemployment rises by 3%a€”
but I see that pattern as driven by the Federal Reserve's unwillingness since 1980 to tolerate 
anything that at all smells of a high-pressure economy.

I don't think (4) is very likely at alla€”it seems to me to be a significant outlier scenario. I 
see the issue as: who do you trust to run policy if things go south? Jay Powell or 10 Republican 
senators.
And the answer to that question seems obvious to me...

Six Paragraphs:

From an economists™ s point of view, this is very strange: a huge mismatch between the value of a 
steady chip supply from TSMC for the automobile industry, and the automobile industrya€™ s
willingness to pay for it. There are going to be supply- and value-chain management business school 
cases coming out of this for some time to come:

Ryan Anderson: Chips, Automotive, & the Future: a€~The industry hardest hit by the shortage right 
now is automobile manufacturing. Volkswagen, Nissan, GM, and Ford
have all announced significant production cuts. Ford has projected as much as a 20% drop in 
production this quarter due to the shortages!. Nearly 70% of microcontroller
units that end up in cars rely, at least in part, on semiconductors from a single Taiwanese 
companyS! Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)S!. TSMC
now manufactures chips for major tech companies like Nvidia, AMD, and even AppleS™ s new custom A14 
(mobile) and Ml (laptop) chips. Chips from those 3

companies are incredibly valuable. A top-of-the-line Nvidia graphics card costs almost $2,000 and 
AMD CPUs can run over $600S!. The automobile industry operates
differently. The initial buyers of the semiconductors are companies like Renesas and NXP who design 
the microcontrollers a car relies on. Automobile manufacturers then
buy  the microcontrollersa€I. TSMC may end up charging $1 for a semiconductor that a $40,000 car 
relies on. As a manufacturer who has more demand than they can fill,
TSMC is going to prioritize the high-value chips. Meaning these car parts, which only account for 
3% of TSMCS™ s revenue, go to the back of the line. (RJA)S!

What is best in life? Clearly, necessities. But conveniences and luxuries are, well, merely 
convenient and luxurious. I think the first key is noting that wealth has a purpose: to get things 
done. And I
think the second key is to be mindful of what is going on around you, both in the human and in the 
physical world, with your conveniences and luxuries:

Wikipedia: Hedonic Treadmill: S'Hedonic adaptation may be a more common phenomenon when dealing 
with positive events as opposed to negative onesS!. Negative
emotions often require more attention and are generally remembered betterS!. Adopting Soenon-zero 
sumSD goals, those which enrich oneS™ s relationships with
others   and with society as a whole (i.e. family-oriented and altruistic goals), increase the 
level of subjective well-being. Conversely, attaching importance to zero-sum life
goals (career success, wealth, and social status) will have a small but nevertheless statistically 
significant negative impact on peoples™ s overall subjective well-beingS!.
Contradicting set point theory, Headey found no return to homeostasis after sustaining a disability 
or developing a chronic illnessS!

The smart money on Wall Street has stopped doing its job of betting on fundamental values, and is 
instead for the most part off doing more complicated things. And, as a result, our financial
markets is really weird. But then, when have they not been?:

Jamie Powell: This Is The Electric Vehicle Bubble. And This Is The Crash: S~DonS™t say we didnS™t 
warn youS!. The entire thing was bonkers. Companies with
no revenues, and no working products, were sporting multi-billion dollar valuations. While 
old-school automakers with viable electric vehicles like Ford and General
Motors were struggling to command a valuation at a single digit multiple of earnings. Well, donS™t 
say we didnS™t warn you. Crack: At pixel, the entire EV space is

collapsings!. The only question left is, whenS™ s the bottom? Well given the old school automakers 
trade at 0.6 times revenues, versus 14.4 for the cool electric vehicle
kids, we might only be getting startedS!

These are very large, very persistent, very surprising effects. I need to think more about how what 
appears to be a very small difference back before 1948 still casts such a large shadow today:

Aradhya Sood, William Speagle, & Kevin Ehrman-Solberg: Long Shadow of Racial Discrimination: 
Evidence from Housing Covenants of Minneapolis: S™Over
120,000 historical property deeds with information on racial covenant use from Hennepin County, 
Minnesota, we exploit the unanticipated 1948 Supreme Court ruling that
made racially-restrictive covenants unenforceableS! regression discontinuityS! causal and 
time-persistent effects of racial covenants on present-day socioeconomic
geography                                                                             of 
MinneapolisS!. Houses that were covenanted have on average 15% higher present-day house values 
compared to properties which were not covenantedS!

How dumb will actually-implemented artificially-intelligent neural-network systems turn out to be?:

Charlie Stross: Lying to the Ghost in the Machine: S'Ready-trained NNs like GPTS“3 or CLIP are 
often tailored as the basis of specific recognizer applications and then
may end up deployed in public situations, much as shitty internet-of-things gizmos usually run on 
an elderly, unpatched ARM linux kernel with an old version of OpenSSH
and busybox installed, and hard-wired root login credentials. This is the future of security holes 
in our internet-connected appliances: metaphorically, cameras that you can
fool by slapping a sticker labelled SoeTHIS IS NOT THE DROID YOU ARE LOOKING FORSD on the front of 
the droid the camera is in fact looking for. And in five
yearsS™ time theyS™re going to be everywhere. IS™ ve been saying for years that most people relate 
to computers and information technology as if they S™ re
magic,   and to get the machine to accomplish a task they have to perform the specific ritual 
theyS™ ve memorized with no understanding. ItS™ s an act of invocation, in
other words. UI designers have helpfully added to the magic by, for example, adding stuff like 
bluetooth proximity pairing, so that two magical amulets may become
mystically entangled and thereafter work together via the magical law of contagion. ItS™ s all 
distressingly bronze age, but we havenS™ t come anywhere close to
scraping   the bottom of the barrel yet. With speech interfaces and internet of things gadgets, 
weS™re moving closer to building ourselves a demon-haunted worlda€!. We
can  lie to the machinesa€”and so can thieves and sorcerersa€!. It becomes possible to convince a 
ghost that the washing machine is not a washing machine but a
hippopotamusa€!

Again: remember and recognize just how far we have come:


Yuval Noah Harari: Lessons from a Year of Covid: For thousands ot years food production relied on 
human labour, and about 9U per cent ot people worked m tarming.

Today in developed countries this is no longer the case. In the US, only about 1.5 per cent of 
people work on farmsa€!
