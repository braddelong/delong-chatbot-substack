Former U.S. Senator David Perdue… holding a Tuesday rally… to protest the plant and investor George Soros…. “Brian Kemp is selling us out to George Soros…. He’s pledged our tax dollars to lure a California company funded by George Soros to Georgia and is calling it ‘economic development…. Kemp thought he could get away with this under the guise of ‘economic development,’ but all he is doing here is selling us out and lining George Soros’s pockets.”… Soros Fund Management…&nbsp;owns more than 2% of Rivian’s shares… the 10th-largest shareholder…. </p><p>Perdue… has campaigned largely on his support from Trump—and his embrace of the ex-president’s false claims of a stolen 2020 election…. The planned plan… 45 miles… east of Atlanta, is… promising to employ more than 7,500 people and pump out 400,000 electric vehicles annually…. The plan has local detractors, who complain that it would bring environmental problems and Atlanta-style sprawl to the community. They’ve launched a Facebook page and a GoFundMe site to raise money to hire a lawyer…. The company’s November IPO was the sixth biggest in U.S. history, generating $13.5 billion in net proceeds…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://thechicagodailytribune.com/rivians-soros-connection-becomes-issue-in-georgia-governor-race-crains-chicago-business/">https://thechicagodailytribune.com/rivians-soros-connection-becomes-issue-in-georgia-governor-race-crains-chicago-business/</a>&gt; </p></blockquote><p>As I understand it, Georgia will commit $125 million in subsidies. If the direct-employment number is an accurate forecast, that is a $10,000 state-tax capital cost per-job-created number. I see the substantive equities of the subsidies this way: They are almost surely not a good use of tax money for the nation as a whole, for which industrial-location decisions are close to being zero-sum. But they are almost surely a good use of tax money, from the perspective of generating enough economic activity within Georgia to allow for lower state tax rates on George's current residents. Brian Kemp—and Rivian—are playing the subsidies-for-industrial-location game as it is currently played in America, which is not a very good game. And Brian Kemp is representing the narrow interests of his constituents (and not exhibiting much American civic virtue). </p><p>Brian Kemp is not cheating his constituents to enrich George Soros and other Rivian investors.</p><p>But David Perdue is trying to cheat his constituents. </p><p>It may well be that behind the scenes Purdue in these people are attempting to reassure Rivian, saying: Don’t worry—this is only boob-bait for the bubbas; actually, we are not opposed to economic development in order to make Georgians richer. The problem, of course, is that there is only one way to react when somebody says: I’m a liar, but I’m not lying to <em><strong>you</strong></em>—I’m lying to the other guy. The way to react is to think: There are low-wage areas of Maryland and Colorado, and even of New York and California, where we could locate, and not have to worry about the state government going <em><strong>mushugannah</strong></em><strong> </strong>against economic development because some wrong-kind-of-Black person from Atlanta might get a job, or some rootless-cosmopolite foreign-born liberal Jew might be involved.</p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video: Drone Warfare:</h2><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1498155219657674756&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Another video of a Ukrainian TB2 UCAV strike, presumably with a MAM munition, on a Russian Buk system.

Moscow badly miscalculated. The Russian operation was focused on getting to Kyiv quickly, forcing a surrender, and pushing a small number of units forward quickly in a way that avoided large engagements with UKR forces. They’ve been skirting major cities, going for key road junctions/smaller towns, etc. Why did Moscow choose this course of action? A few theories: they didn’t take Ukraine &amp; its military seriously. They wanted to avoid attrition &amp; devastation because of consequences for pol goals in Ukraine, costs of casualties, and they want to hide the costs from the public. It is also possible that Russian military planners genuinely wanted to avoid inflicting high levels of destruction given how unpopular this war was going to be at home. Most Russian soldiers are young &amp; have little interest in fighting Ukrainians as an opponent…. This is… unworkable…. It seems they tried to win quickly and cheaply via ‘thunder runs,’ hoping to avoid the worst of sanctions &amp; Western outrage. They’ve ended up in the worst of all worlds, trickling more resources into a failed strategy. However, this is barely a few days into the war…. The bulk of the Russian military has yet to enter the fight…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1498381975022940167&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Long thread about how I think the first 96 hours have gone, still very early/incomplete impressions.
