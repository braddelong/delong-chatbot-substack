And by the end of the story you feel as though highly similar problems have appeared several times: a never-ending game of whack-a-mole.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32dc4c4a-cb4a-4b93-a238-bc924a975254_2816x1866.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32dc4c4a-cb4a-4b93-a238-bc924a975254_2816x1866.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32dc4c4a-cb4a-4b93-a238-bc924a975254_2816x1866.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32dc4c4a-cb4a-4b93-a238-bc924a975254_2816x1866.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32dc4c4a-cb4a-4b93-a238-bc924a975254_2816x1866.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/32dc4c4a-cb4a-4b93-a238-bc924a975254_2816x1866.png" width="1456" height="965" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/32dc4c4a-cb4a-4b93-a238-bc924a975254_2816x1866.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:965,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4394714,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32dc4c4a-cb4a-4b93-a238-bc924a975254_2816x1866.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32dc4c4a-cb4a-4b93-a238-bc924a975254_2816x1866.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32dc4c4a-cb4a-4b93-a238-bc924a975254_2816x1866.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32dc4c4a-cb4a-4b93-a238-bc924a975254_2816x1866.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Stable Diffusion via Night Cafe: “Alan Blinder and the Wheel of <em>Fortuna</em>”</figcaption></figure></div><div class="paywall-jump"></div><p>Thus Alan writes, concerning the question about whether inflation expectations were well-anchored and could be expected to ebb (“α &lt; 1”, in his framing) or was highly persistent, with each shift in the inflation rate then permanently embedded in the likely future), about how when he:</p><blockquote><p>entered graduate school in the fall of 1967…. empirical evidence virtually screamed out that α &lt; 1…. Theory and empirics clashed sharply. As Groucho Marx memorably asked, “Who are ya gonna believe, me or your own eyes?” The view at MIT, as I recall, was go with your own eyes…</p></blockquote><p>Which was, at the time, the right thing to do. For the MIT economics crowd was looking in the wrong direction: “Thomas Sargent… was demonstrating—in a beautiful five-page paper… underappreciated at the time—that the debate… was beside the point…”</p><p>Now the same problem is back—do inflation expectations remain well-anchored or not? Is the answer the same as it was in the 1970s? Perhaps; perhaps not. Right now is one of the few times I do not wish in my heart that I was on the Federal Reserve, for right now the burden of responsibility is overwhelming while the degree of our ignorance is much greater than usual.</p><p>Overall, the book is very nice indeed. It lets us ride along in the passenger’s seat over the extremely rocky road that the U.S. government has driven as it has tried, since World War II to manage the country’s macroeconomy in attempting to achieve price stability, full employment, financial robustness, and healthy investment.</p><p>The individual episodes as the Wheel of <em>Fortuna</em> turns are all strikingly, wittingly, and—I believe—almost completely accurately described. The book is highly recommended. Read and absorb it, and you will be qualified to present yourself as a wise and respected elder statesmen who has seen much in the way of macroeconomic policy, and whose advice about the lessons of history is worth listening to.</p><p>But are there overarching themes to the book in the great number of successive individual episodes to serve as case studies, other than the one of the Wheel of <em>Fortuna</em>?</p><p>Here is a second theme that I have picked out. While <em>history</em>—correctly handled—can be of great utility in understanding current situations, <em>theory</em>—at least currently fashionable theory—is not. Blinder judges that once-fashionable monetarism “rose to prominence on a combination of some hotly disputed scholarly work, Milton Friedman’s singular brilliance and skill in debate, and perhaps most important the rise of inflation… [in which] Keynesianism was unjustly tagged as inherently “inflationary” and… registered substantial influence on policy formulation…” But its influence on policy was malign: “The policy debate was… about whether fiscal policy not accommodated by monetary policy mattered. As it turns out, it did…” Of New Classical Economics “with this ‘policy ineffectiveness’ result [which] conquered vast swaths of academia in the 1970s and 1980s…”, Blinder judges that central bankers ignored it, and that they were right to do so and it was fortunate that it did so. And is the current workhorse DSGE-New Keynesian academic framework useful in understanding those aspects of the world that policymakers need to understand? Blinder’s skepticism here is, I think, 100% right.</p><p>Perhaps there are two other big themes as well to the two—Wheel of <em>Fortuna</em>, and dangers of believing in fashionable theory—I have noted:</p><p>Third, monetary policymakers permanently tarnish their reputations for all time when they make their decisions on political grounds. Arthur Burns’s reputation did not survive his excessive concern for Nixon’s reelection in 1972. And Alan Greenspan “tarnished his gold-plated reputation by seeming to endorse the Bush tax cuts…” His semi-endorsement did, I think, push them across the legislative line back in 2001, to the country’s substantial detriment.</p><p>Fourth, proper demand-management-and-growth fiscal policy is incredibly complex. The appropriate rules-of-thumb shift from decade to decade in ways that it is impossible for the political system to comprehend in anything like real time. And this is a huge problem. John Maynard Keynes back in 1936 thought the proper stabilization policy required both fiscal and monetary policy, was attainable by technocratic management, and could solve both of economies’ major macroeconomic problems—unemployment and income distribution. But we cannot get there.</p><p>And overall? The book is highly, highly recommended.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/draft-review-of-alan-blinder-a-monetary/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/draft-review-of-alan-blinder-a-monetary/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p>
