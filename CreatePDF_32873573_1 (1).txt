If moderate raises in the minimum wage do not cause unemployment, who can object to thema€”but why 
do they not cause higher unemployment, if they in fact do not?

I haven't had a chance to see the famous video from
Straumli Realm, except as an evocation. (My only
gateway  onto the Net is very expensive.) Is it true
that humans have six legs? I wasn't sure from the
evocation. If these humans have three pairs of legs.

by June 2025 and then adjust it to increase at the same rate as median hourly wages. In this
report, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill’s effects on the federal budget.

■ The cumulative budget deficit over the 2021-2031 period would increase by S54 billion.
Increases in annual deficits would be smaller before 2025, as the minimum-wage increases
were being phased in, than in later years.

■ Higher prices for goods and services—stemming from the higher wages of workers paid at or
near the minimum wage, such as those providing long-term health care—would contribute to
increases in federal spending.

■ Changes in employment and in the distribution of income would increase spending for some
programs (such as unemployment compensation), reduce spending for others (such as
nutrition programs), and boost federal revenues (on net).

•  Where does -0.5 come from?

•  30% chance of -0.2; 40% chance of

•  I cannot follow the logic here at all...

Adam Smith  “It Is But Equity...

Is  this  improvement  in  the  circumftances  of
the lower ranks of the people to be regarded as
an advantage or as an inconveniency to the fo-
ciety? The anfwer feems at firft fight abundantly
plain.  Servants,  laborers  and  workmen  of  dif­
ferent  kinds,  make  up  the  far  greater  part  of
every  great  political  fociety.  But  what  im­
proves the circumftances of the greater part can
never  be  regarded  as  an  inconveniency  to  the
whole. No fociety can furely be flourifliing and


happy, of which the far greater part of the mem­

bers  are  poor  and  miferable.  It  is  but  equity,
befides  ,  that  they  who  feed,  clothe  and  lodge
the whole body of the people , fliould have fuch
a {hare of the produce of their own labor as to
be  themfelvet  tolerably  well  fed,  clothed  and
lodged.
