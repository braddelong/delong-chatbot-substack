Since the start of this year, we have had an 0.25%-point rise in the Federal Funds rate, and aa 1%-point rise in the real Treasury 10-year rate—nine times the standard gearing. Why? Because monetary policy is not just the current level of the Fed Funds rate, but is the current level plus all the forward guidance that gives the anticipated future path of the Fed Funds rate. In the shifts in monetary policy that you should pay attention to are not what the Fed does at its meetings, but rather the unexpected component of Fed actions, and the surrounding word cloud of communications that are the forward guidance.</p><p>If you thought at the start of this year that the Fed was behind the curve, and that it needed, through Fed-Funds rate increases and shifts in forward guidance, to do things with effects on long-term real interest rates that would be the equivalent of a 5%-point increase in the Fed Funds rate, then I have news for you: The Fed is 3/5 of the way there. If you thought, like me, that the costs of tightening too soon and being wrong were very high—that the 2010s were a disaster, in which an ænemic secularly-stagnant economy grossly underperformed in employment and productivity growth, substantially because the Fed had let itself get trapped at the zero lower bound in nominal interest rates—then the past four months should lead you to think that the Fed is, if anything, slightly ahead of the curve right now, and should stay its (currently planned) course of Fed-Funds interest-rate increases, rather than accelerate them. Rather than accelerate rate increases further, it should watch what changes in financial conditions over the past four months are about to do to the future of housing investment:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Robert Armstrong &amp; Ethan Wu</strong>: <em>The Panglossian Consensus</em>: ‘Here is a case for optimism. Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon… in a note last month…. “It’s very hard to see why the private sector would feel compelled by a fed funds rate of 2 per cent or so by the end of this year to cut back spending to the point where the economy might tip into recession….. We expect a steep drop in housing market activity over the next few months… [but] housing aside, we see few reasons to expect private sector spending to weaken, and plenty of reasons to expect solid growth, notably the potential for catch-up spending on services…. We just don’t buy the idea that the Fed faces a binary choice…. It will be more useful to think in shades of grey.”… The Fed’s trade-off is probably less sharp than many think…. The path is narrow, not… unwalkable. Perhaps the consensus suffers from a bit of optimism bias: a perfectly plausible base case with an unsettlingly wide scope to be wrong…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9928cdab-9e2f-44e4-86e9-6b1a9c888579">https://www.ft.com/content/9928cdab-9e2f-44e4-86e9-6b1a9c888579</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>But one joker has been dealt: The 5/5 forward rate—what those trading in the bond market expect CPI inflation to be not over the next five years but over the five years after that—is now trading at the very top of what has become the normal range. If the 5/5 rate moves higher, it will be a sign that the bond market no longer trusts the Fed to maintain inflation at or below its target over the long run. That would be a sign that the economy’s inflation anchor is not lost, but starting to drag. And that would be a powerful piece of information suggesting that the Fed should accelerate its tightening cycle a notch.</p><p>Overall, however, I am still on Team The-Fed-Has-Got-This, and Team This-Is-Not-Like-the–1970s-at-All.</p><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/marking-my-view-of-the-macroeconomic?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thank you for reading Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality.

Vance in 2016 on Donald Trump:</h3><p>Not at all surprising, but still:</p><blockquote><p><strong>J.D. Vance</strong> (2016): ‘I'm not surprised by Trump's rise, and I think the entire party has only itself to blame. We are, whether we like it or not, the party of lower-income, lower-education white people, and I have been saying for a long time that we need to offer those people SOMETHING (and hell, maybe even expand our appeal to working class black people in the process) or a demagogue would. We are now at that point. Trump is the fruit of the party's collective neglect….</p><p>I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn't be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he's America's Hitler. How's that for discouraging?…</p></blockquote><p>We presume that J.D. Vance does not think that Donald Trump is America is Hitler, because if he did his new Trump-loving and Trump-worshiping persona the demonstrate a remarkable degree of pure evil in his soul.</p><p>But then we think that if JD Vance were not evil, he would have a plan to offer his “lower-income, lower-education white people” “SOMETHING” other than racist-adjacent culture-war garbage.

The platform that you built on was the web or on email… open protocols designed by the government and academia… became the governing protocols of the early internet… a very positive thing…. Web2… 2005 to 2020… social networking…. A big negative thing with Web2: We basically handed over the power of the effective de facto control of the internet to five or so companies. Open protocols still exist, you can still go to websites, but effectively most of the power and most of the money on the web goes to Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, and maybe Twitter and a handful of other[s]…. If Web3 works right… it is the best of both worlds of Web1 and Web2… advanced functionality… from Web2… the predictability, reliability, and neutrality of Web1 protocols… creative people, businesses, and startups… reach audiences directly, and to truly have a relationship with those audiences that is not mediated by algorithms and advertising… which is where I think we are today…. A lot of why Twitter won is that, opposed to RSS, they had a global namespace. The problem with RSS and with Mastodon is the internet right now has no publicly owned, common database; there is no place to store that follow graph. That is why companies stepped in and said, “We’ll store it for you.” Then once they stored it, they ended up having monopolistic network effects.

By Donald Cohen and Allen Mikaelian: For 40 years, both Republican and, regrettably, Democratic administrations have been turning over control of health care, public water supplies, infrastructure and transportation, criminal justice, education, prisons, parks, policing, sanitation, libraries, the weather service, and more to private companies. Donald Cohen and Allen Mikaelian’s The Privatization of Everything documents, in far more detail then has ever been done, this dismantling of the public sector. In the privatizer’s worldview, this shift from public to profit-seeking private management will lead to cost-cutting and greater attention to customer satisfaction, reduce taxes, and shrink the size of government.
