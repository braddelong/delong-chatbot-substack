First: Appreciating & Reviewing Patrick Wyman: The Verge:

Let me start with some background:

Karl Polanyi saw three fundamental types of economic organization: reciprocity, redistribution, and 
exchange:

(1) Reciprocity is the human division of labor mediated by our psycho-sociological propensity to 
engage in gift-exchange. Reciprocity is limited to our kin (and not all of them), our friends, and 
our neighbors.

(2) Redistribution follows the logic of power: it may have some component of social insurance, it 
may have some component of provision of some kind of public goods, but most of the time it is tuned 
to the advantage of the trained-professional thugs-with-spears and their fraudster cousins: the 
strong do what they wish, and the week suffer what they
must.

(3) Exchange comes in with the invention of money. All of a sudden your psycho-sociological 
gift-exchange relationships that mediate the reciprocity-based division of labor are not confined 
to kin, friends, and neighbors. Rather, any one of the other 8 billion people in the world can 
become your partner in a one shot money mediated win-win market
exchange. Money allows the division of labor to be deepened and widened to an unbelievably large 
and an unbelievably productive extent.

But there is more: Reciprocity, and redistribution too, are carried out at valuation ratios that 
have a psycho-sociological logic. But the market-exchange one-shot system of organizing the 
division of labor is carried out at prices that are not fair, in the sense of being what people 
deserve given their status and identity, but rather prices that balance supply -
and-demand. This gives it an extraordinary flexibility, as people are given massive incentive to 
respond to market signals. The market economy thus crowdsources the solutions to the problem it 
sets itself, and that is a good thinga€”even though most of the time the problem at the market 
economy sets itself is how to make the life of the richest
luxurious and the life of the merely rich comfortable. Crowdsourced solutions allow humanity to 
function as a very smart anthology intelligence, as opposed to top-down solutions that force 
humanity to function as a very dumb hive mind.

What happens when we take a leap beyond cash-on-the-barrelhead money and into extended long-term 
debf! Much of the time debt simply serves to rob the non-rich of what little social power they 
possess in a market economy. By not requiring half the interest due be paid immediately, and by 
instead adding it to the principal, the moneylender does
you what he sees asa€”and what you must acknowledge asa€”a favor. You then owe the money-lender 
more than just a larger because compounded market-economy debt. You also owe the moneylender a 
favor in a reciprocal gift-exchange relationships that has acquired a sociological tinge, and made 
him not just your creditor but, in some sense, your
benefactora€”and that eventually turns into him being your lord, and then your master.

And now let me come to my main point:

But sometimes debt plays a different role. Sometimesa€”debt plays a role analogous to the role that 
money plays as a way of triggering crowdsourcing solutions to the market economya€™ s problem of 
getting the right commodities to those with the demand. Sometimes debt is a way of getting people 
with ideas for things to do but no control over
resources into contact with people with control over resources but no idea what to do with them. 
Sometimes debt greatly amplifies the entrepreneurial energies of a society vastly beyond previous 
imagininga€”an amplification for both good and ill.

And this brings us to Patrick Wyman: The Verge: Reformation, Renaissance, and Forty Years that 
Shook the World <https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Verge/CvQLEAAAQBAJ>:

In just four decades [1490-1530]a€”the blink of an eye, relatively speakinga€’’Europe erupted. 
Around 1490a€! Europe was a backwatera€!. An alien visitor looking for the high pointsa€! would 
have much preferreda€! Istanbul or Beijinga€! Tenochtitlan, Delhi, Cairo, or Samarkand. Europea€! 
an economic and political
periphery, an also-rana€!. No sane bettor would have placed their money on Europe as the genesis of 
globally vast colonial empires, much less the home of industrialization and the utter 
transformation of world economies several hundred years down the linea€!

So what happened? Many things happened. In Patrick Wymana€™ s view, over 1490-1530 western Europe 
suddenly becomes very creative across a wide range of processes:
Exploration, state growth, gunpowder warfare, the printing press, and the consequences that went 
along with thema€!

Something like the Ottoman Empire or Ming China could have mobilized its civilizational capacity to 
accomplish thesea€”but the resource-mobilization process was always a top-down one, a matter of the 
logic of redistribution, and the giver-of-orders at the center would have to be interested. (Which 
he sometimes was, but in this era almost always in
gunpowder warfare, and on occasion exploration.)

By contrast, western Europea€™ s emerging form of financial capitalism allowed all of these 
a€ceentrepreneuriala€D ideasa€”not just gunpowder warfare, but exploration, investments in state 
capacity, printing and knowledge dissemination, and lots of other things as well, all of them:

expensive, capital-intensive processes and technologicsa€I substantial amounts of money for initial 
financing, and even more to sustain thema€!. Any one of these processes was a major development in 
its own righta€!. All of these processes collided in the short decades on either side of 1500. That 
was not a coincidence; the
availability of capital had supercharged all of them. Each process was intensely disruptivea€!

And, as Wyman stresses, many of these processes were intensely evil.

These processes of financial capitalism-fueled entrepreneurshipa€’’economic, social, political, and 
military entrepreneurshipa€”did not slow down after 1530, but continued to accelerate. Western 
Europe thus explored the possibilities of patterns of human organization and interaction in a way 
no civilization had ever been able to before. Thus the
resulta€”for good and illa€”was us.

I very highly recommend Patrick Wymana€™ s The Verge.

For Paid Subscribers Only: One Future for American Politics

Looking forward, here is one of the possiblea€”perhaps even likelya€”futures for American politics.

In it, major Democratic Party initiatives will be nullifieda€”as the Voting Rights Act and 
campaign-finance reforma€”or crippleda€”as ObamaCare wasa€”by the Supreme Court, until court 
expansion takes place. Court expansion will take place only when the Democrats have a Senate 
majority and the marginal senators in the majority will be willing
to prioritize the long-run interests of the party over their short-run electoral interests in 
triangulation: in other words, never, given the large pro-Republican gerrymandering of the Senate. 
The attachment of blue-state electorates and politicians to nonpartisan redistricting commissions 
well red-state politicians have no truck with such foolishness will
produce a gerrymandering of the House and of state legislatures as well. If the Republicans are 
a€oesmarta€n and partisan, they will lose the 2024 election but in so doing have two or three state 
legislatures assert that they, rather than any vote count, are the arbiters of who the electors 
will be. Thus by 2028 there will be precedent that electors will be
chosen by Republican-gerrymandered state legislators when it mattersa€”when it doesna€™t, the 
ballots can by countered.

We are thus, I think, looking forward to a generation of minority rule. Now if Republicans were 
willing to work for their constituents, that would not be the worst thing in the world. Republican 
constituents, after alla€”with the exception of the plutocrats and the lower-upper class Republican 
Worthiesa€”have neither economic nor cultural power, and

constituents, after alla€”with the exception of the plutocrats and the lower-upper class Republican 
Worthiesa€”have neither economic nor cultural power, and
if they have political power they can bargain to get an America in which they do not get quite as 
short an end of the stick.

But Republican politicians will not bargain for their constituentsa€™ material interests. Instead, 
they will provide lower-upper class Republican Worthies with low taxes and sociological 
predominance, plutocrats with corrupt augmentations to their fortunes as long as they play 
political-cultural ball with their Republican politician-masters, and the base
with culture-war victories over foreigners and the urban rootless cosmopolites.

How are we to think about this potential future? I find myself looking for rhyming episodes in past 
history. And I have concluded that I need to learn a lot more about Americaa€™ s Bourbon Deep South 
from the breaking of Populism on the altar of racial animosity to the coming of the Civil Rights 
era.
So what should I read next to understand it?

Here is one thing. Here is Lyndon Johnson, during the 1964 campaign, in New Orleans, talking about 
that South as he tried his mightiest to break it:

Some of my political philosophy was born in this State. As a young secretary, I came to New Orleans 
before I ever went to Washington. I saw something about the political history of Louisiana. And I 
saw a man who was frequently praised, and a man who was frequently harassed and criticized, and I 
became an admirer of his
because I thought he had a heart for the people.

When I went to Washington in the dark days of the Depression as a young country kid from the poor 
hills of Texas, I had a standing rule with the page office that every time Senator [Huey] Long took 
the floor, he would call me on the phone and I would go over there and perch in the Gallery and 
listen to every word he said.
And I heard them all.

I heard a lot about the history of this State. I heard a lot of names in this State. But I never 
heard him make a speech that I didn't think was calculated to do some good for some people who 
needed some speeches made for them and couldn't make them for themselves.

The things that I am talking about from coast to coasta€”I talked to six New England States last 
week and I am going to speak in six western States next weeka€”the things I am talking about from 
coast to coast tonight and tomorrow and next week are the things that he talked about 30 years ago.

• He thought that every man had a right to a job, and that was long before the Full Employment Act.

• He thought that every boy and girl ought to have a chance for all the education they could take, 
and that is before the     GI bill of rights.

• He thought that the old folks ought to have social security and old age pensions, and I remember 
when he just scared the dickens out of Mr.     Roosevelt and went  on a nationwide radio hookup 
talkingfor old folks' pensions. And outof this probably   came our social  security system.

• He believed in medical care for those so that they could five indecency and dignity in their 
declining years, without their children having     to come and move them into their house with 
them. He was against poverty and hated   it with all his soul and spoke until hisvoice was hoarse.

Well, like Jack Kennedy, he believed in those same things. But their voices are still tonight, but 
they have left some to carry on. And as long as the good Lord permits me, I am going to carry on.

Now, the people that would use us and destroy us first divide us. There is not any combination in 
the country that can take on Russell Long, Allen Ellender, Lyndon Johnson, and a few others if we 
are together. But if they divide us, they can make some hay. And all these years they have kept 
their foot on our necks by appealing
to our animosities, and dividing us.

Whatever your views are, we have a Constitution and we have a Bill of Rights, and we have the law 
of the land, and two-thirds of the Democrats in the Senate voted for it and three-fourths of the 
Republicans. I signed it, and I am going to enforce it, and I am going to observe it, and I think 
any man that is worthy of the high
office of President is going to do the same thing. But I am not going to let them build up the hate 
and try to buy my people by appealing to their prejudice.

I heard a great son of Texas who came from an adjoining State, whose name I won't call [Joe 
Bailey], but he was expelled from the university over there and he started West, and he got to 
Texas as a boy and stopped to see a schoolmate of his.

He liked things so well in Texas that he just decided to make it his permanent address. In 4 years 
he went to the Congress. After he had been in the House 2 years, he became the Democratic leader, 
and he served a few years as Democratic leader. And he went to the Senate and he served in the 
Senate 4 years and he became the
Democratic leader in the Senate. He served the district that Mr. [Sam] Rayburn later served.

When Mr. Rayburn came up as a young boy of the House [around WWI], he went over to see the old 
Senator, the leader [Joe Bailey], one evening, who had come from this Southern State, and he was 
talking about economic problems. He was talking about how we had been at the mercy of certain 
economic interests, and how
they had exploited us. They had worked our women for 5 cents an hour, they had worked our men for a 
dollar a day, they had exploited our soil, they had let our resources go to waste, they had taken 
everything out of the ground they could, and they had shipped it to other sections.

He was talking about the economy and what a great future we could have in the South, if we could 
just meet our economic problems, if we could just take a look at the resources of the South and 
develop them. And he said, "Sammy, I wish I felt a little better. I would like to go back to 
old"a€”and I won't call the name of the
State; it wasn't Louisiana and it wasn't Texas:

I would like to go back down there and make them one more Democratic speech. I just feel like I 
have one in me. The poor old State, they haven't heard a Democratic speech in 30 years. All they 
ever hear at election time is "na€”a€”r, na€”a€”r, na€”a€”r!"
