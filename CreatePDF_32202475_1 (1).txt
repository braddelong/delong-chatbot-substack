There was a profound shift from the belief in a€oedivine righta€D and a€oenatural ordera€D as the 
fundamental grounding for an unequal society to enlightenment valuesa€”that human institutions 
should be rationally designed on the basis of a rational understanding of human psychology in order 
to attain the greatest good of the greatest number, and thus that inequality is not given by the 
gods or by the requirements of nature, but rather is a thing to be
allowed to the extent that it incentivizes cooperation and industry and thus enriches us all.

Back in the century of the -300s, Aristotle had taken it for granted that a good society was only 
possible if the society allowed for philosophy. And philosophy was only possible if you had a 
leisured upper class. And a leisured upper class was possible only with large scale-unfree 
labora€’’serfdom, or its harsher cousin slavery. Thus it was and thus it would always, be unless 
and until humans obtained the fantasy technologies of the mythical Golden Age. That
was what Aristotle wrote: that a€oechief workmen would not want servants, nor masters slaves a€O 
only if:

every instrument could accomplish its own work, obeying or anticipating the will of others, like 
the [blacksmithing] statues of Daedalus, or the three-wheeled catering serving-carts of Hephaestus, 
which, says the poet: "of their own accord entered the assembly of the Godsa€Ua€! the shuttle would 
weave and the plectrum touch the harp without a hand to guide thema€!

Thus it was fortunate that:

It is manifest therefore that there are cases of people of whom some are freemen and the others 
slaves by nature, and for these slavery is an institution both expedient and justa€!. There exist 
certain persons who are essentially slaves everywherea€!. Slavery for the one and mastership for 
the other are advantageous and just, and it is proper for the one party to be governed and for the 
other to govern by the form of government for which
they are by nature fitted, and therefore by the exercise of mastershipa€!

And even in the middle of the 1800s, Abraham Lincoln thought it prudent in the Lincoln-Douglas 
debates to give a bow to the belief that humans were unequal, grossly unequal, by command of nature 
or of God:

I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races. 
There is a physical difference between the two, which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid 
their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity 
that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I 
belong having the superior positiona€!. I agree
with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respectsa€”certainly not in color, perhaps not in 
moral or intellectual endowments!

But Lincoln then turned on a dime, and making his main point after a a€cebuta€D:

There is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated 
in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happinessa€!. In 
the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my 
equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living mana€!

Moreover, humanity was bout to begin to gain the autonomous robotic blacksmithing statues of 
master-craftsman Daedalusa€”and more, a thousand-folda€”and also food-production, food-processing, 
and food-distribution technology vastly outstripping the self-propelled catering carts of 
Hephaestus the smith-god. Our shuttles now weave without hands to guide them. And as for the need 
for a hand to guide each making of a musical notea€”wella€!


Thus between 1870 and our day it ceased to be a necessity to own or to have some direct or indirect 
dominion over slaves and near-slaves in order to be rich in material terms and thus approach 
utopia.

Who was the first person to write down words like these?:

We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable: that all men are created equal & independant, that 
from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable, among which are the 
preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these ends, governments 
are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governeda€l
This means: if people do not consent and believe that the government is vindicating their inherent 
and inalienable rights that they derive from their equal and independent creation, then it is a 
sacred and undeniable truth that that governmenta€”and the societal order it supports and 
maintainsa€”is no true government at all.

Do you think the writer was John Locke, Niccolo Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, Thomas Jefferson, or 
George Washington?
Yes, it was Thomas Jefferson in the year 1776.

This is the opening of his first draft of the Declaration of Independence of the United States of 
America: the glorious statements of (a) fundamental human equality, and (b) equal human rightsa€”to 
life, liberty, and then what usually shows up as a€oepropertya€n but which TJ called a€oepursuit of 
happinessa€D.

Perhaps he wrote it thus to make it broader than just a right to own property and turn it into a 
right to have onea€™ s own sphere of autonomy within which one could form plans and try to 
accomplish them to pursue onea€™ s happiness. That broader right simply could not be accomplished 
by a narrow right to own property, but required and requires much broader support.
But perhaps is was to make the right narrower.

In Virginia in 1776 to assert that it was a a€oesacred and undeniablea€D truth that a€oeall mena€D 
had an a€oeinherent and inalienablea€D right to one property would cast considerable shade on the 
key Virginia institution of slaverya€”for the slaves had, in Virginia mythology, not only alienated 
their own inalienable right to own property, but they had alienated their childrena€™ s right to 
own property and their own and their descendants rights to be
anything but property.

However, here we are interested in the shift in ideals to enlightenment utilitarian values, rather 
than in the hypocrisy of the gap between ideals and reality.

Accepting the enlightenment values of the U.S. Declaration of Independence^’’that governments are 
instituted among humans to vindicate their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; 
and that governments that do not vindicate those rights and to which humans thus do not consent are 
no true governments at alla€”does not give much guidance to what kind of government should be 
instituted, and what kind of societal order it should support.
In the late 1700s James Madison had not been enthusiastic about democracy:

Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention... incompatible with personal 
security or the rights of property... as short in their lives as... violent in their deathsa€l

James Madison was enthusiastic about a republic. People who counted were to choose a small, select 
group of representatives who had their values and well-being at heart, but not their passions or 
their interests. Representatives would then govern subject to procedural checks-and-balances. Under 
Madison and companya€™ s America constitution, remember, states could restrict the franchise as 
much as they wisheda€”as long as it preserved a€oea republican
form of government .a€D

James Madisona€™ s suspicions had been widely shared. His one-time friend and co-author Alexander 
Hamilton even held that a constitutional monarchya€”in which the monarch, the aristocracy, and the 
masses all held real power to balance one anothera€”was the best of all attainable governments, 
with a€oethe British governmental besta€D as the only one a€oeunit[ing] public strength with 
individual securitya€la€D And Thomas Jefferson suspected
George Washington thought Hamilton was right, and that the American republic might fail: 
a€oeGeneral Washington had not a firm confidence in the durability of our governments□. Jefferson 
thought this fear a€oehad some weight in his adoption ofa€l ceremoniesa€! calculated to prepare us 
gradually for a change which he believed possible.a€D And John Adams proposed that the American 
president be announced as: a€oeHis Highness, the President of the
United States, and Protector of the Rights of the Samea€D.

We had thought that the questions of political order had been settled first in the rubble of Berlin 
in 1945, and then in the streets of East Germany in 1991: We had thought they had been settled in 
favor of representative democracy that balanced off interests and got as close as possible to the 
will of the median voter necessary for proposals to command majority assent, while having 
sufficient constitutional checks-and-balances to ensure the protection of minority
rights. (Rather than a a€oeleadership statea€D in which popular unity was created by obeying the 
commands of a visionary ruler). We had thought they had been settled in favor of private property, 
a mixed economy, and social insurance. (Rather than either a laissez-faire a€oefree to starvea€D 
system or a command economy directed by the elite cadres of a ruling party that possessed the 
intellectual key to the lock that guarded the riddle of historical
development.)

We had thought that the questions had been settled in favor of constitutional representative and 
liberal democracy, plus a private-property market-heavy mixed economy with social insurance.

But are these now reopened? As senior Chinese leader Min Zhu (zece±ze°‘) said to mea€”with 
absolutely no trace of irony at alla€”back in 2015: a€oeWhat are you Americans going to do to fix 
your broken political system?a€D

In spite of fears about the instability and irrationality of democracies and the desirability of 
keeping politics in the hands of sober successful people with property, as the 1800s moved forward, 
democracy a€”at least in the form of one male of the right age and race, one votea€”as the 
touchstone of political legitimacy made massive strides, if at deliberate speed. Claims that kings 
ruled by divine right and that aristocracies ruled by virtue of their ancestors having
been among those who conquered the Anglo-Saxons with William of Normandy or the Romano-Gauls with 
Clovis the Frank became increasingly risible and ran aground. So many aristocrats were noble 
because their ancestors had been fixers, pimps, or bureaucrats for past kings.

For a while prosperity was an alternative touchstone: rulers should be elected or at least advised 
by those selected by vote, yes, but by a vote of the prosperous. FranA§ois Guizot, left-of-center 
Prime Minister of Francea€™ s constitutional monarchy in the early 1840s, responded to demands for 
a broader electoral franchise with the words a€oeenrichessez vousa€D: if you want to vote, get rich 
enough that you qualify. It did not work. On February 23,1848,
King Louis-Philippe of Francea€™ s Orleanist dynastya€”the only king of the Orleanist 
dynastya€’’threw Guizot over the side in the hope of avoiding revolution and dethronement. Louis 
Philippe abdicated the following day.

Worldwide, politicians on the left wanted, eventually, more than one person-one vote. They sought 
the abolition of private property and the rational distribution of the products of the societal 
division of labora€! well, by it was not clear what. But that position was rejected by the bulk of 
political society: only rarely could it win any majorities for its position that the government 
should have a totalizing rolea€”that all questions should be settled and all social life
organized by a government, in which each one counted for one and one alone.

Worldwide, politicians on the right held the view that some existing inequalities of wealth, 
influence, and political power were just or holy or both. But they were divided. Some viewed 
inequalities emerging from the creative destruction and accumulation of the market with, at best, 
suspicion. Others viewed inherited and status inequalities with grave suspicion. Some tried to 
reconcile and exalt all the groups of inheritors, entrepreneurs, and crony capitalists, but
that was a difficult balancing act.

Thus the balance point was in the middle. Over the 1800s the political principle that caused the 
least offense to the greatest number being that political society would be a realm in which some or 
most of the male individualsa€™ preferences counted equally in choosing the government, and that 
the government would then curb and control the economy, to limit but not extinguish the extra 
influence of those whom American Republican President Theodore
Roosevelt called the a€oemalefactors of great wealtha€D early in the 1900s.

When the left of center was in power they would try extend on the principle that the new, poorer 
voters would be less conservative and would support them.

When conservatives were in power they might convince themselves to extend the suffrage, on the 
grounds that the workers were loyal to king and country, were being exploited by the merchant, 
manufacturing, and commercial agricultural classes, and would be grateful: it would a€oedish the 
Whigsa€D.

When revolution threatened, governments fearing armed mobs in the streets would decide that 
franchise extension would divide the potentially-revolutionary opposition: a€oeThe Principala€! is 
to preventa€! revolutiona€!. I am reforming to preserve, not to overthrow,a€D said Earl Grey in the 
debate over the 1831 franchise-extension reform bill.

Thus extension of the suffrage tended to creep forward, step by step. Franchise expansions put real 
power in the hands of poorer and less aristocratic votersa€”or, rather, of those they chose as 
their representatives. Thus even aristocrats sought to make them able to wield that responsibility. 
British cabinet member Robert Lowe argued that after making the richer segment of the working class 
the masters of the government: a€oewe must educate our mastersa€D.

There was or would be great tension between the political voice and power that came with one 
man-one vote democracy and not just the old order of landed aristocrats but the new order of the 
market economy.

In a later day, Friedrich von Hayek would always argue that to inquire whether a market economya€™ 
s distribution of income and wealth was a€cefaira€D or a€cejusta€D was to commit a fatal and basic 
intellectual blunder. a€ceJusticea€D and a€cefairnessa€D of any form requires that you receive what 
you deserve. But a market economy gives not to those who deserve well,. T but rather those who 
happen to be in the right place at the right time to control
resources that are valuable for future production. Once you step into the morass of a€oesocial 
justicea€D, Hayek believed, you would be forced into adjustment after adjustment. You would not be 
able to stop chasing a a€cejusta€D and a€cefaira€D outcome a€oeuntil the whole of society was 
organizeda€! in all essential respectsa€! [as] the opposite of a free society.a€D

Note that Hayek did not believe (much) in inherited feudal, guild, and customary blockages to 
decentralized market exchange: they should be steamed away. Then the market would giveth; the 
market would taketh away; and blessed would be the name of the market. That a market economy can 
produce a highly unequal and can produce a less unequal distribution of income and wealth was 
besides the point. We lacked and would always lack the knowledge to
create a better society.

The only rights the market economy recognizes are property rightsa€”and then it only recognizes 
those property rights that are valuable, and the most valuable property rights are those useful in 
making things for which the rich have a serious jones.
Yet people thought they had other rights than just the rights that accrued to the property they 
happened to hold. They had bigger and more fundamental objections to a market society than just the 
objection that it makes some rich and others poor.

Hungarian-Jewish moral philosopher Karl Polanyi wrote during World War II in his book The Great 
Transformation, not everything is or can be a commodity: making some things into commodities is a 
fiction. A market society will thus face a backlasha€”it can be a left-wing, it can be a right-wing 
backlash, but there will be a backlash, and it will be powerful. Polanyi wrote about how land, 
labor, and finance were a€oefictitious commoditiesa€D that could not
be governed by the logic of profit-and-loss but had always and needed to be embedded in society and 
managed by the community taking account of religious and moral dimensions.

These werea€”area€’’brilliant insights. But in The Great Transformation they are incomprehensible 
to an overwhelming proportion of those who try to read Polanyi.
Let me try to put it better:

The market economy believes that the only rights that matter at all are property rights. The market 
economy believes that the only property rights that matter a lot are those that produce things for 
which the rich have high demand.
But people believe that they have other rights:

•  With respect to land, people believe that they have rights to a stable community: that the 
natural and built environment in which they grew up or that they made with their hands is theirs, 
whether or not market logic says it would be more profitable and lucrative if it were different or 
if somebody else lived there.

•  With respect to labor, people believe that they have rights to a suitable income: they have 
prepared for their profession, they have played by the rules in so doing, and so society owes them 
a fair income commensurate with their preparation, whether or not the world marketa€™ s logic says 
that what they make has a free-market price that can support that income or not.

that what they make has a free-market price that can support that income or not.

•  With respect to finance, people believe that as long as they do their job of working diligently, 
the flow of purchasing power through the economy should be such as to give people the wherewithal 
to buy. The decisions of rootless cosmopolite financiers who may be thousands of miles away that 
this or that flow of purchasing power through the economy is no longer sufficiently profitable, and 
so should be shut off, should not be able to make your job
dry                                                                                                 
                                                                                                    
      up and blow away.

Note that these rights that society will attempt to validate do nota€”or might nota€”be rights to 
anything like an equal distribution of the fruits of industry and agriculture. And it is probably 
wrong to describe them as fair: they are what people expect given a certain social order of 
society. A market order that generates wages seen as too high for Chinese immigrants and 
opportunities seen as insufficient for white Californians seeking jobs in agriculture will call
forth riots and a Chinese Exclusion Act in California late in the 1800s. A market order that 
generates too much Polish spoken on too many German-owned farms in the early 1900s will start 
German right-wingers thinking about the drang nach osten, by which the military-religious order of 
the Teutonic Knights pushed the German-Slavic language frontier a couple of hundred miles east in 
the Middle Ages. A market order that replaces blue-collar assembly-line
worker jobs with robots while generating new jobs only in big liberal cities early in the 2000s 
will generate a€oeeconomic anxietya€D.

But society will not like the tension between the market economy and its beliefs about the rights 
governments should vindicate. And as, with one man-one vote, society rather than its comfortable 
upper stratum gains political voice, it will seek a political solution: it will seek something that 
people will call a€cesocialisma€D.
Left-wing socialists believed that the backlash to the market would produce overwhelming popular 
revolutionary demands for a government to take control of the economy and guarantee jobs at equal 
and fair wages for all. They were to be surprised and astonished when the mass of the people 
disagreed.

We first saw this in 1848, in the June days of Paris. Urban workers wanted the government to 
guarantee full employment and fair wages in publicly-funded and -run urban workshops. They sought 
to overthrow the government. They found that the peasants disagreed: The peasants had gotten their 
farms in the Great French Revolution half a century earlier. They did not want urban workers to 
seize control and force them to pay higher taxes to support urban
layabouts who ought to go back to their familiesa€™ farms when there was no work in the city.

French intellectual and politician Alexis de Tocqueville was amazed. He wrote of:

The insurrection of June [1848]... class against class... a blind and rude, but powerful, effort on 
the part of the [urban] workmen to escape from the necessities of their condition, which had been 
depicted to them as one of unlawful oppressiona€!. The closing of the national workshopsa€! 
occasioned the risinga€!.

Thousandsa€! hastening to our aid from every part of France.... Thanks to the railroads, some had 
already come from fifty leaguesa€™ distance... every class of society... peasants... shopkeepers... 
landlords and nobles all mingled together... They rushed into Paris with unequalled ardour: a 
spectacle as strange and unprecedented in our revolutionary annals.  The insurgentsreceived no 
reinforcements, whereaswe had all France for

reservesa€!

Evenas the electorate grew, its center of the electorate was fearful of the unregulated market 
economy, yet also fearful of a left-wing socialism that looked hazily forward to some form of 
revolution and a utopia in which private property would not be. And socialist parties were 
hopelessly confused.

On the one hand the policy changes they asked for now were weak tea: the reform plans were mild. 
The Socialist Party of Germanya€™ s Erfurt and Gotha programs sought things like: holidays for 
elections, two-year legislative terms, the right to bear arms, equal rights for women, the 
prohibition of spending public funds for religious purposes, free public schoolsand colleges, free 
medicalcare including midwifery, an eight-hour working day, no child labor
under 14, a 36-hour minimum weekend, an occupational safety and health administration

But then they also looked forward to revolutiona€”and to class war. They did say that the 
revolution would be peaceful: a€oeBy every lawful means to bring about a free state and a 
socialistic societya€!a€D But their goals were maximal. This peaceful, legal, constitutional 
revolution would a€oeeffect the destruction of the iron law of wages by doing away with the system 
of wage labora€!a€D This peaceful, legal, constitutional revolution would lead to large-
scale confiscations of all private property: a€oeThe transformation of the capitalist private 
ownership of the means of production^’’land and soil, pits and mines, raw materials, tools, 
machines, means of transportation^’’into social property and the transformation of the production 
of goods into socialist production carried on by and for societya€!a€D

And they believed in class war, or at least that the industrial working class was the only class 
that had a right to govern: a€oeThisa€! emancipation^! [is] of the entire human racea€!. But it can 
only be the work of the working class, because all other classesa€! have as their common goal the 
preservation of the foundations of contemporary societya€la€D

Hence there was an immense gap between their policies and their rhetoric. This led to great 
confusiona€”on the part of the voters, and of the left-wing socialist leaders and cadres 
themselves. What were they for? Which did they really mean? Were they violent revolutionaries 
biding their time? Were they constitutional politicians and organizers with utopian aspirations and 
a tendency to get carried away when addressing the faithful? Voters did not know. Their
opponents did not know. They did not know.


French intellectual and politician Alexis de Tocqueville was amazed. He wrote of:

The insurrection of June [1848]... class against class... a blind and rude, but powerful, effort on 
the part of the [urban] workmen to escape from the necessities of their condition, which had been 
depicted to them as one of unlawful oppressiona€!. The closing of the national workshopsa€! 
occasioned the risinga€!.

Thousandsa€! hastening to our aid from every part of France.... Thanks to the railroads, some had 
already come from fifty leaguesa€™ distance... every class of society... peasants... shopkeepers... 
landlords and nobles all mingled together... They rushed into Paris with unequalled ardour: a 
spectacle as strange and unprecedented in our revolutionaryannals.  The insurgents received no 
reinforcements, whereas we had all France for

reservesa€!

Even as the electorate grew, its center of the electorate was fearful of the unregulated market 
economy, yet also fearful of a left-wing socialism that looked hazily forward to some form of 
revolution and a utopia in which private property would not be. And socialist parties were 
hopelessly confused.

On the one hand the policy changes they asked for now were weak tea: the reform plans were mild.
