What Might Pass...

Reconciliation, plus:

• Things where Reconciliation has passed a bill that then gets Republicans to come to the
negotiating table—my favorite ideas:

• Do Medicare-for-all via Reconciliation, and then bargain back to whatever healthcare
financing policy the Biden team really wants.

• A huge honking carbon tax through Reconciliation, and then bargain back to cap-and-
trade.

• Whatever else Schumer & Manchin are willing to drive with 50 votes, plus

•  What at least 7 of the 13 of Collins, Toomey, Burr, Tillis, Rick Scott (F), Rubio, Cruz,
Cornyn, Portman, Ernst, Grassley, Tim Scott (SC), and Graham can be induced to take
the  lead on, own, and make their own.

•  And then Pelosi has to hold her entire caucus together in the House—or find a red-dog
group to work with

Is Say’s Law a Controlling Force? No!

In 1803, Say said: “no
demand-driven general
gluts”

•  By 1829 Say had changed his mind

• An excess demand for cash is an
excess supply of everything else—a
“general glut”

•  Government can spend, or provide
assets to eliminate the excess
demand for cash

•  Governments can thus cure demand-
driven depressions


Falling into the Great Depression

No action to stop the slide
into the Great Depression

•  Governments and central banks did
not follow the standard nineteenth­
century policy playbook

•  Shocks to confidence:

• Recession beginning

•  Stock market crash

•  1930 banking crisis

•  1931 banking crisis

•  Late 1931 international crises


Four Members of the Austerity Caucus

von Hayek, Schumpeter, Mellon,
Hoover:

•  Expected recession self-limiting—natural
restoration of “confidence”

•  Let the private sector handle the depression

•  Depressions accomplish “something which has
to be done, namely, adjustment to change”

•  Hoover’s anguish in the 1950s

•  Why didn’t the Federal Reserve think the
economy needed more cash?

•  Liquidity & safety

9n?n-ni-nR


There Were Wise Economists...

Chief among them John Maynard
Keynes

•  Also prominent: Ralph Hawtrey: “Crying
‘Fire, Fire!’ in Noah’s Flood!”

•  The croakings of the Cassandras were ignored

• History of 2000-2020 rhyming with
1929-1933?

• Why can’t we make our own mistakes?

•  Why can’t we recognize that we should think:
“the market was made for man; not man for
the market”?

•  Why instead: “the market giveth; the market
taketh away: blessed be the name of the
market”?

And the Transcript:

DeLongTODAY: Is Today Rhyming with the History of the Great Depression?

Introduction:

I am Brad DeLong, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a sometime 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. This is the weekly DeLongToday briefing. Here I 
hold forth here on the Leigh Bureaua€™ s vimeo platform on my guesses as to what I think you most 
need to know about what our economy is doing to us right now.
I promised Wes Neff when he agreed to provide the infrastructure for this that I and my briefings 
would be: lively, interesting, curious, thoughtful, and relatively brief. **Relatively.**

I promised I would provide briefings on a mix of: forecasting, politics, macroeconomic analysis, 
history, and political economy.

Today is mostly an economic history briefing, trying to tease out lessons from the past for us 
today. Leta€™ s remember the past, and make sure that today does not rhyme with it in a bad waya€!
But first...

Governance & Congressional Procedure:

Some say it is the Internet, especially Facebook. Others say it is Fox News, with its business 
model of terrifying old people to keep their eyeballs glued to the screens so it can make money by 
selling them fake diabetes cure is an overpriced cold front. I see it is as Newt Gingricha€™ s 
radicalization and nationalization of the Republican Party, and then the ability of Gingrich and 
his successors, most prominently Mitch McConnell, in prioritizing party loyalty
above all else, and turning Republican legislators into potted plants.

Do we now have an opportunity to return to the normal modes of governance? Actually, I think not. 
It has now been 30 years since there was an informal centrist send it coccus that tried to build 
societal near consensus on effective technocrat policies. We do not know how to do that anymore. 
The best we can hope for is for Biden, Schumer, Pelosi and Company to figure out what is best for 
America, and then to figure out a way to hold the marginal members of
their caucuses to the votes. It will not be an easy task.

What are the prospects for legislation? And administrative action? The first hurdle is that Biden 
has to get the Democratic senators to be willing to let him drivea€”get them all to understand that 
their reelection chances as well as the countrya€™ s future depend on Bidena€™ s presidency being a 
success and being perceived as a success. If that is not accomplished, then things get bad. And it 
was not accomplished by Clinton or by Obama.
If that can be accomplisheda€”if the Democratic senate caucus can focus on maintaining something 
like the party unity that the Republican senate caucus has had since the election of Clintona€”we 
move on to the next roadblocks.

First, rank the Republican senators in order of the purpleness of their statesa€”and add in Romney 
and Murkowski as virtual purple-state Republican senators. They are red-state senators who are 
playing a different game than their colleagues in the Republican senate caucus.

To get to 50 senators and pass bills with Kamala Harris, Majority Leader Schumer needs to hold 
Manchin, or pick off either one of Romney or Murkowski, or pick off one of, in order of ascending 
redness, the thirteen purple-state Republican senators: Collins, Toomey, Burr, Tillis, R. Scott 
(F), Rubio, Cruz, Cornyn, Portman, Ernst, Grassley, T. Scott (SC), or Graham

To get to 60 senators and so overcome filibusters or budget points-of-order, the Democrats need to 
hold Manchin; get Collins, Romney, and Murkowski; and then pick off at least seven of, in order of 
ascending redness, the thirteen purple-state Republican senators: Collins, Toomey, Burr, Tillis, 
Rick Scott (F), Rubio, Cruz, Cornyn, Portman, Ernst, Grassley, Tim Scott (SC), and Graham. The 
question is: how many of those thirteen want to pursue the strategy of
a€oela€™ m not loyal to the obstructionist party barons; instead I get things donea€”and the things 
I get done are the things I want to do, not the things Biden and Schumer and Pelosi want to doa€D 
as both a road to reelection and as, you know, a way to hold their heads up and look at themselves 
in the mirror in the morning.

Thus which things will pass the Senate this year? The answer is:

1. Reconciliation things

2. Things where Reconciliation has passed a bill that then gets Republicans to come to the 
negotiating tablea€”my favorite idea is to do Medicare-for-all via Reconciliation, and then bargain 
back to whatever healthcare financing policy the Biden team really wants. Also, a huge honking 
carbon tax through Reconciliation, and then bargain back to cap-and-trade

3. Whatever else Schumer & Manchina€™ s are willing to drive with 50 votes, plus

4. What at least 7 of the 13 of Collins, Toomey, Burr, Tillis, Rick Scott (F), Rubio, Cruz, Cornyn, 
Portman, Ernst, Grassley, Tim Scott (SC), and Graham can be induced to take the lead on, own, and 
make their own.
And then Pelosi has to hold her entire caucus together in the Housea€”or find a red-dog group to 
work with.

Much better than the past four years. But it does not strike me as good, or as anything that would 
lead anyone in any other country to see America as a model for how to run a 
democratic-with-a-small-d government.

Failures of American Governance in Historical Perspective:

History does not repeat. But it does rhyme. I have been thinking about the failure of the American 
government to do the Right Thing with respect to the COVID-19 plague, and to the failure of the 
American government to do the Right Thing with respect to prioritizing swift and full recovery from 
the Great Recession, and then looking back at the Hoover administration^’’and its failure to do any 
of the Right Things from 1929 to 1933.
So let me tell you the Great Depression story of the Hoover administration, as I understand it 
right now.

As the world slid into the Great Depression from 1929-1933, central banks did not take large-scale 
emergency steps to boost cash in the hands of the public. It is straightforward to narrate the 
slide. It is not straightforward to understand why central banksa€”and governments that could have 
upped their direct spending and employmenta€”sat on their hands.

a€oeSaya€™s Lawa€O

Back in 1803 there was a French economist, Jean-Baptiste Say, who argued that there was no such 
thing as a depression that was caused by a shortage of aggregate demand and that could be cured by 
the government spending more, or by the government giving or loaning people money to induce them to 
spend, more. Back in 1803 Say argued that if there was a shortage of spending on one commodity it 
meant that there was excess demand for another onea€”and
if there was unemployment, it was only because bad regulations or a lack of information was keeping 
workers and entrepreneurs from shifting from the sector where there was excess supply to the sector 
where there was excess demand. The solution, Saya€™ s followers have said ever since, was not to 
stimulate the economy but rather to unleash the free marketa€”to remove whatever regulations or 
subsidies, especially things like unemployment insurance, were
impeding the process of reallocation.

It is peculiar that Say has had followersa€”and he has had followers to this day. He still has 
them. For Say, after the British Canal Panic of 1825, recognized that he had been wrong back in 
1803. In late 1825 the banks and merchants of England decided ithat they had made too many loans to 
too many counterparties whose investments were not turning out well. They ceased to advance cash in 
return for being given title to promises to pay that merchants had
received from customers. Thus, Say wrote: a€cecommerce found itself deprived at a stroke of the 
advances on which it had counteda€!a€D The consequence, Say wrote, was financial and economic 
collapse: a true a€oegeneral gluta€D, and the first industrial-era business cycle and depression.

Money and credit are, in the last analysis, liquid trust. And if there is not trust that your 
counterparty is solvent, the money and credit will not be there. And if there is a large excess 
demand for money, all other commodities will be in excess supply: mass unemployment and shuttered 
factories.

Now there is one organization that is almost always trusted to be good for the money. The 
government accepts the money that it itself issues as payment for taxes, and so everybody who owes 
taxes will be willing to sell what they have in return for the money the government has printed up. 
Whenever the economy freezes up due to a shortage of demand and of income, the government can fix 
ita€”as long as its own finances are trusted over the long terma€”by
boosting the amount of government-issued cash in the publica€™ s hands. People then will be able to 
buy. Their purchases then become extra income for others. Those others will then be able to scale 
up their purchases. And so the economy will unwedge itself.

There are a number of ways the government can get extra purchasing power into the hands of the 
public to cure a depression:

1. It can have its functionaries throw bundles of cash out of helicoptersa€”an arresting image 
coined originally by Milton Friedman (a reference to which earned former U.S. Federal Reserve Chair 
Ben Bernanke his nickname of a€oeHelicopter Bena€D).

2. The government can hire people, set them to work, and pay them.

2. The government can hire people, set them to work, and pay them.

3. The government can simply buy useful stuff, and so provide the extra demand to make it 
profitable for employers to hire more people, set them to work, and pay them.

4. The government can have an arma€”a central banka€”that trades financial assets for cash.

As the world slid into the Great Depression from 1929-1933, central banks did not take large-scale 
emergency steps to boost cash in the hands of the public. It is straightforward to narrate the 
slide. It is not straightforward to understand why central banksa€”and governments that could have 
upped their direct spending and employmenta€”sat on their hands.

Shocks to Confidence & Excess Demand for Cash:

The start of the recession in mid-1929 was the first shock to confidence. The stock market crash of 
late 1929 was consequence of that shock and of overleverage, and was itself a second, major 
confidence shock that quickly transmitted itself around the entire world. Then, a year later, came 
a banking crisis in the United States. The thought that your money in banks might get locked away 
and be inaccessiblea€”or vanish completely a€’’gave a further substantial
boost to the excess supply of money. March 1931 saw a second banking crisis. The summer and fall of 
1931 saw panics in other countries, which made the Great Depression great worldwidea€”and greatest 
in Germany.

Up until late 1930, the excess demand for cash was on the demand side: with the Roaring Twenties 
over and the stock market in a pronounced bear market, demand for cash is elevated. But starting in 
late 1930 banks began to get scared and to restrict the amount of cash in the form of bank deposits 
they were willing to provide to their customers. They called in loans, and cancelled lines of 
credit, as they sought to raise the ratio of their own reserves they held to
the deposits that they owed to their customers. And households began to want to raise their 
currency-to-deposits ratio: to hold more cash under the mattress for each dollar of deposits they 
left in the bank. From late 1930 on up into 1933, month by month these reserves-to-deposits and 
currency-to-deposits ratios grew as confidence became lower and lower, and so month by month the 
money supply shrank. 1931 had been a year of banking and International
financial crises. 1932 saw no large extra crises, but it also saw no recovery, as the situation was 
now so dire and so unprecedented that there was no recovery of a€oeconfidencea€D.

Conventional anti-Keynesian economic thinking is that any depression will be cured faster if wages 
and prices are encourageda€”or forceda€”to fall in nominal terms. The same amount of spending in 
dollars will then buy more stuff and provide demand for more people to work. The problem is that 
when wages and prices fall, debts contracted in fixed nominal terms do not fall as well. Thus falls 
in pricesa€”deflationa€’’during the Depression set in motion
bankruptcies which set in motion further contractions in production, which triggered additional 
falls in prices. With prices falling at ten percent per year, investors could calculate that they 
would earn less proi-Ot investing now than delaying investment until next year when their dollars 
would stretch ten percent further. Demand for cash went up and the excess supply of goods and 
services grew. Banking panics and the collapse of the world monetary system cast
doubt                                                                                               
                                                                                                    
               on everyone's credit and reinforced the belief that now was a time to watch and 
wait. The slide into the Depression, with increasing unemployment, falling production, and falling 
prices, continued throughout then newly-elected Herbert Hoovera€™ s Presidential term.

At its nadir, the Depression was collective insanity. Workers were idle because i-Orms would not 
hire them to work their machines; i-Orms would not hire workers to work machines because they saw 
no market for goods; and there was no market for goods because workers had no incomes to spend. 
Orwella€™ s account of the Great Depression in Britain, The Road to Wigan Pier, speaks of 
a€oe...several hundred men risk[ing] theirlives andseveral hundred
women scrabbling] in the mud for hours... searching eagerly for tiny chips of coala€D in slagheaps 
so they could heat their homes. For them, this arduously-gained a€cefreea€D coal was a€oemore 
important almost than food.a€D While they risked and scrabbled, all around them the machinery they 
had previously used to mine in i-CIve minutes more than they could gather in a day stood idle.

Austerity

In the slide into the Great Depression elites doubled down on the austerity that they had committed 
themselves to in the 1920s. Faced with the gathering depression, the i-Orst instinct of governments 
and central banks was to do nothing.

Businessmen, economists, and politicians (memorably Secretary of the Treasury Mellon) expected the 
recession of 1929-1930 to be self-limiting. They expected workers with idle hands and capitalists 
with idle machines to try to undersell their still at-work peers. Prices would fall. When prices 
fell enough, entrepreneurs would gamble that even with slack demand production would be proi-Otable 
at the new, lower wages. Production wouldthen resume. Thisis
how earlier recessions had come to an end.

Throughout the declinea€’’which carried production per worker down to a level 40 percent below that 
which it had attained in 1929, and which saw unemployment rise to take in almost a quarter of the 
American labor forcea€”the U.S. government did not try to prop up aggregate demand. The Federal 
Reserve did not use open market operations to keep the money supply from falling. Instead the only 
signii-Ocant systematic use of open market operations was in
the other direction. To discourage gold outflows after the United Kingdom abandoned the gold 
standard in the fall of 1931, interest rates went up.

The Federal Reserve thought it knew what it was doing: it was letting the private sector handle the 
Depression in its own fashion. And it feared that expansionary monetary policy or fiscal spending 
and the resulting deficits would impede the necessary private-sector process of readjustment. The 
do-little-to-nothing approach, the unwillingness to use policy to prop up the economy during the 
slide into the Depression, was backed by a large chorus, which included
some of the most eminent economists around. For example, from Harvard Joseph Schumpeter argued that 
a€oedepressions are not simply evils, which we might attempt to suppress, but forms of something 
which has to be done, namely, adjustment to change.a€D Or, as Friedrich von Hayek wrote, a€oeThe 
only way permanently to mobilize all available resources is, therefore to leave it to time to 
effect a permanent cure by the slow process of adapting the
structure                                                                                           
                                                                                                    
                  of production^!a€D As Schumpeter put it, in his view: a€oeAny revival which is 
merely due to artificial stimulus leaves part of the work of depressions undone and adds, to an 
undigested remnant of maladjustment, new maladjustment of its own which has to be liquidated in 
turn, thus threatening business with another [worse] crisis aheada€!a€D

The market giveth, the market taketh away, buta€”in this casea€”not blessed but cursed be the name 
of the market.

From the 1950s and contemplating the wreck of his countrya€™ s economy and his own political 
career, Herbert Hoover cursed those in his administration who had advised inaction during the 
downslide:

>The a€oeleave-it-alone liquidationistsa€D headed by Secretary of the Treasury Mellon felt that 
government must keep its hands off and let the slump liquidate itself. Mr. Mellon had only one 
formula: a€oeLiquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estatea€D. He 
held that even panic was not altogether a bad thing. He said: a€oelt will purge the rottenness out 
of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down. People
will work harder, live a more moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will 
pick up the wrecks from less competent peoplea€Da€!

This ruling doctrinea€”that in the long run the Great Depression would turn out to have been good 
medicine for the economy, and that proponents of stimulative policies were shortsighted enemies of 
the public welfarea€”was, to put it bluntly, complete batsa€”-. John Stuart Mill had nailed the 
analytical point back in 1829: an excess demand for money was what produced a a€oegeneral gluta€D, 
and if the economya€™ s money supply were matched to money
demand, there would be no depression. Practical central bankers had developed a playbook for what 
to do. Yet it was not followed.

Why? Perhaps it was because in previous downturns the excess demand for money had triggered a 
scramble for liquidity: people desperate to have more cash they could spend immediately dumped 
other assets, including the government bonds they held. As government bonds fell in price the 
interest rates they paid rose. Central bankers saw such sharp spikes in government bond interest 
rates as a signal that the economy needed more cash. But the Great
Depression was not like previous downturns.

In this downturn the excess demand for money was so broad and fear was so great that it triggered a 
scramble for safety. Yes, people were desperate for more cash, but they were also desperate for 
assets that they could easily turn into cash in the future, The troubles looked as if they would 
last for quite a while, so they dumped other assets on the marketa€”speculative stocks, industrial 
stocks, utility stocks, bonds of all kinds, even secure railroad stocks whose
dividends turned out not to be inviolable, plus things like their ancestorsa€™ furniture and their 
summer homesa€”and scrambled for both cash and government bonds. With no government-bond 
interest-rate spike, central bankers were not sure what was going on.

For their part, governments strained their every nerve and muscle to balance their budgetsa€”thus 
further depressing demanda€”and to reduce wages and pricesa€”in order to restore competitiveness 
and balance to their economies. In Germany the Chancellora€”the Prime Ministera€’’Heinrich BrAUning 
decreed a ten percent cut in prices, and a ten to fifteen percent cut in wages. But every step 
taken in pursuit of fiscal orthodoxy made matters worse,
especially as expected future deflation further depressed investment. Why invest now if you expect 
deflation, so that everything you might buy this year would be ten percent cheaper next year?

Cassandras, Croaking:

During the Great Depression a few economists understood this process. None of them walked the 
corridors of power. So it was that the ruling a€oeliquidationista€n doctrinea€”that in the long run 
the Great Depression would turn out to have been good medicine for the economy, and that proponents 
of stimulative policies were shortsighted enemies of the public welfarea€”over road the anguished 
cries of dissent from those less hindered by their theoretical
blinders (as well as the anguished cries of the unemployed, hungry, and uncertainly housed if 
housed at all). British economist Ralph Hawtrey scorned those who, like Robbins and von Hayek, 
wrote at the nadir of the Great Depression that the greatest danger the economy faced was

History, Rhyming:

When the history of the global north since 2000 is written, I think that it will read much the same 
as the history of 1929-1933 reads, with one significant difference. Things never got as bad as they 
did in 1933, hence there never was the revolution against SoeausteritySD and all its works and all 
its evil promises and the embrace of reflation that was carried out in the Great Depression years 
by statesmen like Takehishi Korekiyu in Japan, Neville Chamberlain in
Britain, Franklin Roosevelt in the United States, anda€! Adolf Hitler in Germany. Never forget that 
Hitlera€™ s economic policies did what the previous Weimar Republica€™ s had not and restored 
prosperity to Germany, so making him very popular indeed. We still have lots and lots of people 
saying that we cannot prioritize restoring full employ menta€ ’’suppressing the CO VID-19 
plaguea€’’accelerating the pace of vaccinationa€’’accomplishing societal
goals like fighting global warming or reducing the excessive cost of health carea€’’because it 
would interfere with the workings of the neoliberal market system we have constructed. But it is 
not wise to say a€oethe market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the 
market!a€D

That was, I think, the root cause of what went wrong over 1929-1933. So leta€™ s not make their 
mistakes. Let the mistakes we make be new and different ones.

So, instead, we must say a€oethe market was made for man; not man for the marketa€D. As John 
Maynard Keynes said on the floor of the House of Lords during World War II: a€oeWhat we can **do**, 
we can **afford**a€D. Our first task is to figure out what we need to do and to start doing it. 
Figuring out how to adjust the financial scaffolding to support that doing is a second-order 
problem, and one that we are clever enough to solve.

the deposits that they owed to their customers. And households began to want to raise their 
currency-to-deposits ratio: to hold more cash under the mattress for each dollar of deposits they 
left in the bank. From late 1930 on up into 1933, month by month these reserves-to-deposits and 
currency-to-deposits ratios grew as confidence became lower and lower, and so month by month the 
money supply shrank. 1931 had been a year of banking and International
financial crises. 1932 saw no large extra crises, but it also saw no recovery, as the situation was 
now so dire and so unprecedented that there was no recovery of a€oeconfidencea€D.

Conventional anti-Keynesian economic thinking is that any depression will be cured faster if wages 
and prices are encourageda€”or forceda€”to fall in nominal terms. The same amount of spending in 
dollars will then buy more stuff and provide demand for more people to work. The problem is that 
when wages and prices fall, debts contracted in fixed nominal terms do not fall as well. Thus falls 
in pricesa€”deflationa€’’during the Depression set in motion
bankruptcies which set in motion further contractions in production, which triggered additional 
falls in prices. With prices falling at ten percent per year, investors could calculate that they 
would earn less proi-Ot investing now than delaying investment until next year when their dollars 
would stretch ten percent further. Demand for cash went up and the excess supply of goods and 
services grew. Banking panics and the collapse of the world monetary system cast
doubt                                                                                               
                                                                                                    
               on everyone's credit and reinforced the belief that now was a time to watch and 
wait. The slide into the Depression, with increasing unemployment, falling production, and falling 
prices, continued throughout then newly-elected Herbert Hoovera€™ s Presidential term.

At its nadir, the Depression was collective insanity. Workers were idle because i-Orms would not 
hire them to work their machines; i-Orms would not hire workers to work machines because they saw 
no market for goods; and there was no market for goods because workers had no incomes to spend. 
Orwella€™ s account of the Great Depression in Britain, The Road to Wigan Pier, speaks of 
a€oe...several hundred men risk[ing] their lives and several hundred
women scrabbling] in the mud for hours... searching eagerly for tiny chips of coala€D in slagheaps 
so they could heat their homes. For them, this arduously-gained a€cefreea€D coal was a€oemore 
important almost than food.a€D While they risked and scrabbled, all around them the machinery they 
had previously used to mine in i-CIve minutes more than they could gather in a day stood idle.

Austerity

In the slide into the Great Depression elites doubled down on the austerity that they had committed 
themselves to in the 1920s. Faced with the gathering depression, the i-Orst instinct of governments 
and central banks was to do nothing.

Businessmen, economists, and politicians (memorably Secretary of the Treasury Mellon) expected the 
recession of 1929-1930 to be self-limiting. They expected workers with idle hands and capitalists 
with idle machines to try to undersell their still at-work peers. Prices would fall. When prices 
fell enough, entrepreneurs would gamble that even with slack demand production would be proi-Otable 
at the new, lower wages. Production would then resume. This is
how earlier recessions had come to an end.

Throughout the declinea€’’which carried production per worker down to a level 40 percent below that 
which it had attained in 1929, and which saw unemployment rise to take in almost a quarter of the 
American labor forcea€”the U.S. government did not try to prop up aggregate demand. The Federal 
Reserve did not use open market operations to keep the money supply from falling. Instead the only 
signii-Ocant systematic use of open market operations was in
the other direction. To discourage gold outflows after the United Kingdom abandoned the gold 
standard in the fall of 1931, interest rates went up.

The Federal Reserve thought it knew what it was doing: it was letting the private sector handle the 
Depression in its own fashion. And it feared that expansionary monetary policy or fiscal spending 
and the resulting deficits would impede the necessary private-sector process of readjustment. The 
do-little-to-nothing approach, the unwillingness to use policy to prop up the economy during the 
slide into the Depression, was backed by a large chorus, which included
some of the most eminent economists around. For example, from Harvard Joseph Schumpeter argued that 
a€oedepressions are not simply evils, which we might attempt to suppress, but forms of something 
which has to be done, namely, adjustment to change.a€D Or, as Friedrich von Hayek wrote, a€oeThe 
only way permanently to mobilize all available resources is, therefore to leave it to time to 
effect a permanent cure by the slow process of adapting the
structure                                                                                           
                                                                                                    
                  of productiona€!a€D As Schumpeter put it, in his view: a€oeAny revival which is 
merely due to artificial stimulus leaves part of the work of depressions undone and adds, to an 
undigested remnant of maladjustment, new maladjustment of its own which has to be liquidated in 
turn, thus threatening business with another [worse] crisis aheada€!a€D

The market giveth, the market taketh away, buta€”in this casea€”not blessed but cursed be the name 
of the market.

From the 1950s and contemplating the wreck of his countrya€™ s economy and his own political 
career, Herbert Hoover cursed those in his administration who had advised inaction during the 
downslide:

>The a€oeleave-it-alone liquidationistsa€D headed by Secretary of the Treasury Mellon felt that 
government must keep its hands off and let the slump liquidate itself. Mr. Mellon had only one 
formula: a€oeLiquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estatea€D. He 
held that even panic was not altogether a bad thing. He said: a€oelt will purge the rottenness out 
of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down. People
will work harder, live a more moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will 
pick up the wrecks from less competent peoplea€Da€!

This ruling doctrinea€”that in the long run the Great Depression would turn out to have been good 
medicine for the economy, and that proponents of stimulative policies were shortsighted enemies of 
the public welfarea€”was, to put it bluntly, complete batsa€”-. John Stuart Mill had nailed the 
analytical point back in 1829: an excess demand for money was what produced a a€oegeneral gluta€D, 
and if the economya€™ s money supply were matched to money
demand, there would be no depression. Practical central bankers had developed a playbook for what 
to do. Yet it was not followed.

Why? Perhaps it was because in previous downturns the excess demand for money had triggered a 
scramble for liquidity: people desperate to have more cash they could spend immediately dumped 
other assets, including the government bonds they held. As government bonds fell in price the 
interest rates they paid rose. Central bankers saw such sharp spikes in government bond interest 
rates as a signal that the economy needed more cash. But the Great
Depression was not like previous downturns.

In this downturn the excess demand for money was so broad and fear was so great that it triggered a 
scramble for safety. Yes, people were desperate for more cash, but they were also desperate for 
assets that they could easily turn into cash in the future, The troubles looked as if they would 
last for quite a while, so they dumped other assets on the marketa€”speculative stocks, industrial 
stocks, utility stocks, bonds of all kinds, even secure railroad stocks whose
dividends turned out not to be inviolable, plus things like their ancestorsa€™ furniture and their 
summer homesa€”and scrambled for both cash and government bonds. With no government-bond 
interest-rate spike, central bankers were not sure what was going on.

For their part, governments strained their every nerve and muscle to balance their budgetsa€”thus 
further depressing demanda€”and to reduce wages and pricesa€”in order to restore competitiveness 
and balance to their economies. In Germany the Chancellora€”the Prime Ministera€’’Heinrich BrAUning 
decreed a ten percent cut in prices, and a ten to fifteen percent cut in wages. But every step 
taken in pursuit of fiscal orthodoxy made matters worse,
especially as expected future deflation further depressed investment. Why invest now if you expect 
deflation, so that everything you might buy this year would be ten percent cheaper next year?

Cassandras, Croaking:

During the Great Depression a few economists understood this process. None of them walked the 
corridors of power. So it was that the ruling a€celiquidationista€D doctrinea€”that in the long run 
the Great Depression would turn out to have been good medicine for the economy, and that proponents 
of stimulative policies were shortsighted enemies of the public welfarea€”over road the anguished 
cries of dissent from those less hindered by their theoretical
blinders (as well as the anguished cries of the unemployed, hungry, and uncertainly housed if 
housed at all). British economist Ralph Hawtrey scorned those who, like Robbins and von Hayek, 
wrote at the nadir of the Great Depression that the greatest danger the economy faced was 
inflation. It was, Hawtrey said, the equivalent of a€oeCrying, a€~Fire! Fire!a€™ in Noah's 
flood,a€D John Maynard Keynes also tried to bury the liquidationists in ridicule.

Even governments that had unrestricted international freedom of actiona€”like France and the United 
States with their massive gold reservesa€’’tended not to pursue expansionary monetary and i-Cscal 
policies on the grounds that such would reduce investor a€ceconi-Odencea€D and hinder the process
