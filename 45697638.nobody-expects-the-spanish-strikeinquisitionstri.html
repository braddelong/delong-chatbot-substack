I think most scientists did not—upon whose advice and direction we have relied—didn’t see Delta coming,” she said. “We didn’t see Omicron coming. And that’s the nature of what this, this awful virus has been, which as it turns out, has mutations and variants.”… “I get it. I get it. I totally get it,” she said. “I mean, you know, one of the concerns that I have is the undiagnosed and untreated trauma at various degrees that everyone has experienced.” President Biden celebrated “independence” from the virus in an upbeat July 4 speech, saying, “While the virus hasn’t been vanquished, we know this: It no longer controls our lives. It no longer paralyzes our nation. And it’s within our power to make sure it never does again.” At the time, some public health experts warned that his optimism was premature, given that the Delta variant was already a significant threat…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-12-17/kamala-harris-in-interview-says-administration-did-not-anticipate-omicron-variant">https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-12-17/kamala-harris-in-interview-says-administration-did-not-anticipate-omicron-variant</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Well!</p><p>The Rubin question is "what will be wish one, two, five, 10 years from now that we had done here today?” </p><p>Asked at the end of a meeting, either it leads to great confidence and reassurance that the bases are covered, or it completely up-ends the meeting and sends people frantically scrambling off to think and plan how to handle scenarios. It appalls me that I did not learn to do this until I was 33. It is even more appalling that the Biden administration did not focus in December 2020 on the fact that this thing mutates, and that our failure to vaccinate the world as fast as possible was about to give it much more running room and ample test grounds within which to explore its genetic space.</p><p>As Jim Stock first said to me back in February 2020: if we do not, after the fact, look back and say “we took vastly excessive steps to deal with the threat of the virus”, we will not have done enough.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/nobody-expects-the-spanish-strikeinquisitionstri?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/nobody-expects-the-spanish-strikeinquisitionstri?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>ABC</strong>: <em>The Look of Love</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNEdxZURTaI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNEdxZURTaI</a>&gt;: </p><div id="youtube2-cNEdxZURTaI" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;cNEdxZURTaI&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cNEdxZURTaI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay;

A 2.1 percent average growth for the 140 years from 1870 to 2010 is a multiplication by a factor of 21.5. That was very good: the growing power to create wealth and earn an income allowed humans to have more of the good things, the necessities, conveniences, and luxuries of life, and to better provide for themselves and their families. This does not mean that humanity in 2010 was 21.5 times as rich in material-welfare terms as it had been in 1870: there were six times as many people in 2010 as there were in 1870, and the resulting increase in resource scarcity would take away from human living standards and labor-productivity levels. As a rough guess, average world income per capita in 2010 would be 8.8 times what it was in 1870, meaning an average income per capita in 2010 of perhaps $11,000 per year. (To get the figure of 8.8, you divide 21.5 by the square root of 6.) Hold these figures in your head as a very rough guide to the amount by which humanity was richer in 2010 than it was in 1870—and never forget that the riches were vastly more unequally distributed around the globe in 2010 than they were in 1870.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Luigi Zingales</strong>: <em>Burying the Laissez-Faire Zombie</em>: ‘The long-standing dichotomy between the state and the market is misleading, and poses a major obstacle to understanding and addressing today’s policy challenges.

Two four-letter words lie at the heart of contemporary America’s public morality: “free” and “fair.” “It’s a free country” is every American’s boast; “I only want a fair shake” is every American’s plea. Now, to be reminded of the more flagrant forms of unfairness in our national life… is not really why you’re here…. Let’s instead consider a different question: whether our present-day ideals of fairness and freedom, even if we lived up to them, would satisfy our descendants…. I’m being paid very generously to speak here tonight, but I would have gladly done it for much less, perhaps even for free. Trying to persuade people like you to share my ideals, to feel as I do about our common life and fate, to shape a future of beauty and joy rather than ugliness and pain—this is my vocation…. The chief reward is internal: the pleasures of giving and of exercising one’s faculties at their highest pitch…. Nowadays, the gift economy leads a precarious existence, appearing mostly in commencement-day addresses in which graduates are exhorted to follow their dreams, while most of the poor dears are worrying frantically about how to pay their debts. The family is a gift economy, and so is culture…. Much of 19th-century America, where individual households produced their own subsistence, supplemented by mostly face-to-face exchange with other small economic units, was a hybrid…. But ever since that most fateful of innovations, industrial mass production, has become virtually universal, the market economy has progressively squeezed out the gift economy…. Creativity and generosity are not forbidden but they are no longer self-justifying; they are, on the contrary, subordinated, like all activity in the non-public sphere, to the goal of increasing shareholder value. In the private economy, you can do whatever you like—create beauty, pursue truth, help others—as long as what you like to do makes someone a profit…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181023203643/http://georgescialabba.net/mtgs/2018/03/slouching-toward-utopia.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20181023203643/http://georgescialabba.net/mtgs/2018/03/slouching-toward-utopia.html</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Dexter Tiff Roberts</strong>: <em>What Is “Common Prosperity” &amp; How Will It Change China &amp; Its Relationship with the World?</em>: ‘A stage in its development where the turbo-charged years of growth of the last decades should be replaced with one that, at least in official policy statements, is much more focused on equity. “Common prosperity” also is inextricably tied up in the party’s goal to “build a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious” by 2049… help China in building soft power and presenting a China model that might be appealing to other countries…. “The scale of Xi’s ambition has long been clear: he wants to be the peer of Mao and Deng,” writes Andrew Batson, China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Common_Prosperity_IB_2021_1.pdf">https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Common_Prosperity_IB_2021_1.pdf</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Heather Hurlburt</strong>: <em>’Doesn’t this bring us back</em> to the core problem from Putin’s perspective being not US “democracy promotion” but that large numbers of people in his region want democracy (the color revolutions)? <strong>Daniel Larison</strong>: I think there’s a lot to that.

I find myself badly needing guidance on:

a. How much growth theory I should teach at the start of Econ 135?
b. How much of these lecture notes should be simply background reading?
c. How much of them should I go over in lecture?
d. At what pace I should go over them in lecture?

The answers to all these questions depend, of course, on what was covered in intermediate macro, and how many of our students actually took intermediate macro, and on how much intermediate macro our students actually remember. Plus there is the question of how much we are going to want to use growth theory models to do quantitative calculations and counterfactual experiments later on in the course. Which is also something still up for grabs..</div><a class="file-embed-button narrow" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/api/v1/file/981f9dc2-67d5-4cfa-ad17-4e537a00e165.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div></div><p></p>
