When people say Jefferson was merely a 'man of his times' they sell him short. I don't mean this as some sort of rhetorical jiu-jitsu. I find myself quoting [Jefferson's] words when trying to explain slavery's problems. What Jefferson, the man, did doesn't make these words any less meaningful.&nbsp; </p><p>At some point we are going to have to develop something beyond an infantile desire to know whether Daddy was a 'good guy' or a 'bad guy'. In fact, Daddy was an avowed white supremacist, whose words help inspire the black freedom movement.

N2PE was launched by an interdisciplinary group of faculty and students at the University of California, Berkeley with support from the Hewlett Foundation. The roots of the new paradigm reside in ongoing research in social science departments such as Economics, Political Science, Sociology, and History, as well as professional schools such as Business, Law, and Public Policy. The Network fosters an intellectual conversation among faculty and students across these units and encourages them to frame their insights for public engagement and policy relevance. It facilitates collective deliberation on how political economy should be studied and taught as well as how new perspectives on political economy can be applied to broad public debates and pressing policy problems.

As the economy devotes more resources to raising the productivity of talent, low-skilled productivity and wage growth have slowed. With a constrained supply of risk-reducing talent allocated to more productive endeavors, an unconstrained supply of risk-averse savings has lowered interest rates. With improbable innovation needed to capitalize on the value of information, high returns to success have fortunately motivated increased risk-taking, despite the declining productivity of innovators. Proponents of income redistribution have concluded that high returns to success and slowing productivity growth, despite low interest rates, are evidence of rising cronyism, notwithstanding extensive evidence to the contrary.

America is the greatest country in the history of the world! It is also “not great,” “crippled,” and the victim of “carnage”…. A meaty majority of the American population dwells in large metro areas… run by Democrats… unmitigated disasters. You might think… mixed judgment of America’s merits would be logically inescapable once you’ve committed yourself to the idea that half the country lives in one or another crumbling, corrupt, crowded, crime-infested hellhole…. But this isn’t logic; this is a coping mechanism. That’s why the problems that beset America’s cities, whether real or imagined, don’t… count… because they count… against Democrats and Democrats aren’t really American. Or maybe it’s that multicultural Democratic-majority cities don’t count as part of “real” America, so the horrendous problems they are imagined to have can’t drag down America’s greatness score. Either way…. Anti-wokeness is so defensively patriotic because “wokeness”… is the source of the internal treason that leads people to steal the historical spotlight from Betsy Ross and turn it on the sickening experience of enslaved people and hunted natives. Nobody who truly loves America would do that…. So that must be what the woke want in their relentless push to make us look.

The question Wall Street was considering—Ryan Cohen vs. Gabriel Plotkin—was this: GameStop now is a sustainable enterprise: it pays its bills. Suppose GameStop wants to raise an extra $300 million on the equity markets to spend on reorienting itself as it tries to find a path forward. Should those willing to invest that $300 million get, in return, a half-ownership of the firm? Or should they get a 20% ownership of the firm? Gabriel Plotkin believes and bets on the first, and Ryan Cohen believes and bets on the second. The investor community, ultimately, decides. Its judgments tell everyone hwo high a priority for society the expansion of the entity called GameStop should be. Then along comes WallStreetBets, saying: IT SHOULDN'T BE 50%! IT SHOULD BE 2%!!
