First:

I had been thinking that mRNA vaccines gave you 1/8 the risk of catching the virus, 1/20 the risk 
of passing it on, and 1/50 the risk of dying from it. But this appears to suggest that the numbers 
are more like 1/8,1/8,1/25. And with the Delta variant having an R[0] of 7.5 suggests that the 
epidemic is almost fully self-sustaining in a fully vaccinated population. And it also raises the 
possibility that, unless infection-acquired immunity is stronger than mRNA
vaccine immunity, it needs only one small mutation to become self-sustaining no matter what the 
primed-immune-system status of the population:

Greater risk of disease, hospitalization and death among
unvaccinated vs. vaccinated people: National estimates

At current incidence,
35,000 symptomatic
infections per week
among  162 million
vaccinated Americans

Disease incidence              Hospitalization incidence               Death incidence

■ Fully vaccinated ■ Unvaccinated

Data from COVID Tracker as of July 24, 2021. Average incidence 100 cases per 100,000 persons per 
week. Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic illness = 88% (Lopez Bernal et al. NEJM 2021), 
where risk is (1 - VE] or


12%. vaccine effectiveness hospitalization (or death) = yb% (Stowe et al. FHt preprint), where risk 
is (1 - vt] or 4%. Kate in unvaccinated = community rate/(( 1-ruiiy vaccinated coverage) + 
(l-vtj’tuiiy vaccinated

coverage). Rate in fully vaccinated=(l-VE)* Rate in unvaccinated. Fully vaccinated coverage 
proportions were from COVID Data Tracker as of July 24, 2021 (50% for US,).

Lower estimates of VE for mRNA vaccines among
immunocompromised populations: Published evidence

■ 71% (Cl 37-87%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection 7-27 days after 2nd dose of Pfizer-
BioNTech vaccine among immunosuppressed* people vs. 90% (Cl 83-96%) overall1

■ 80% against SARS-CoV-2 infection >7 days after 2nd dose of mRNA vaccine among
people with IBD on immunosuppressive medication2

■ 75% (Cl 44-88%) against symptomatic COVID-19 7-27 days after 2nd dose of Pfizer-
BioNTech vaccine among immunosuppressed* people vs. 94% (Cl 87-97%) overall1

■ 59% against COVID-19 hospitalization among immunocompromised >14 days after
2nd dose of mRNA vaccine3 vs. 91% (Cl 86-95%) without immune compromise3

immunocompromised conditions (e.g., recipients of hematopoietic cell or solid organs transplant, 
patients under immunosuppressive therapy, asplenia, and
chronic renal failure: advanced kidney disease, dialysis, or nephrotic syndrome)

Delta variant vaccine breakthrough cases may be as
transmissible as unvaccinated cases

■ Breakthrough cases reported to national passive surveillance have lower Ct
values by 3 cycles (~10-fold increase in viral load) for Delta (Ct=18, n=19)
compared with Alpha (Ct=21, n=207) and other lineages (Ct=21, n=251)

■ Barnstable County, MA, outbreak: No difference in mean Ct values in
vaccinated and unvaccinated cases [median among vaccinated (n=80): 21.9;
unvaccinated (n=65): 21.5]

(CONFIDENTIAL - preliminary data, subject to change)                            17


Delta variant may cause more severe disease than
Alpha or ancestral strains: Published evidence

■ Canada: Higher odds of hospitalization [aOR 2.20 (Cl 1.93-2.53)], ICU
admission [aOR 3.87 (Cl 2.98-4.99)], and death [aOR 2.37 (Cl 1.50-3.30)]1

■ Singapore: Higher odds of oxygen requirement, ICU admission, or death
[aOR 4.90 (Cl 1.43-30.78)] and pneumonia [aOR 1.88 (Cl 0.95-3.76)]2

■ Scotland: Higher odds of hospitalization [HR 1.85 (Cl 1.39-2.47)]3

□u mm ary

■ Delta is different from previous strains

- Highly contagious

- Likely more severe

-  Breakthrough infections may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases

■ Vaccines prevent >90% of severe disease, but may be less effective at preventing
infection or transmission

-Therefore, more breakthrough and more community spread despite
vaccination

■ NPIs are essential to prevent continued spread with current vaccine coverage

Yasmeen Abutaleb, Carolyn Y. Johnson, & Joel Achenbach: a€~The War Has Changeda€™: Internal CDC 
Document Urges New Messaging, Warns Delta Infections Likely More Severe'. a€~The delta varianta€l 
cause[s] more severe illness than earlier variants and spreads as easily as chickenpox, according 
to an internal federal health document that argues officials must a€oeacknowledge the war has 
changed.a€D The
documenta€l strikes an urgent notea€!. Vaccinationa€l the best defensea€l. Vaccinated individuals 
infected with delta may be able to transmit the virus as easily as those who are unvaccinateda€!. 
a€oel finished reading it significantly more concerned than when I began,a€D Robert Wachter, 
chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, wrote in 
an emaila€l. There are 35,000 symptomatic
infections  per week among 162 million vaccinated Americansa€l. On May 13, people were told they no 
longer needed to wear masks indoors or outdoors if they had been vaccinated. The new guidance 
reflects a strategic retreat in the face of the delta varianta€l. The CDCa€™ s revised mask 
guidance stops short of what the internal document calls for. a€oeGiven higher transmissibility and 
current vaccine coverage, universal masking is
essential to reduce transmission of the Delta variant,a€O it statesa€!. The vaccines are not as 
effective in immunocompromised patients and nursing home residentsa€l. A person working in 
partnership with the CDC on investigations of the delta variant, who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity because they were not authorized to speak, said the data came from a July 4 outbreak in 
Provincetowna€l. The person said the data was
a€oedeeply disconcertinga€D and a a€oecanary in the coal minea€D for scientists who had seen the

Nathan Lane: Manufacturing Revolutions: Industrial Policy and Industrialization in South Korea'. 
a€~South Korea dramatically altered its development strategy with a sector-specific industrial 
policy: the Heavy Chemical and Industry (HCI) drive, 1973a€“1979a€!. I use the sharp introduction 
and withdrawal of industrial policies to study the impacts of industrial policy a€’’during and 
after the intervention perioda€!. (1) HCI promoted the expansion and
dynamic comparative advantage of directly targeted industries. (2) Using variation in exposure to 
policies through the input-output network, I show HCI indirectly benefited downstream users of 
targeted intermediates. (3) I find direct and indirect benefits of HCI persisted even after the end 
of HCI.. the eventual development of directly targeted exporters and their downstream counterparts. 
Together, my findings suggest that the temporary drive shifted Korean
manufacturing into more advanced markets and created durable industrial change. These findings 
clarify lessons drawn from South Korea and the East Asian growth miraclea€!

Rumman Chowdhury: a€™ Friends, I am tired. I work hard to build good things and bring in the right 
people. Parity is no different. For the second time in two weeks, I have to fight a major media 
outlet for basic recognition of my work. The gaslighting is real. The erasure is real: a€oeTo set 
the record straight: Parity 2.0 wouldna€™ t exist without @ruchowdh. In between Accenture and 
Twitter, Rumman worked tirelessly on Parity for a year. She got
customers, proved the model, validated the need, and invented a new way to identify bias in AI 
beyond a€~just dataa€™ .a€D Both Liz and I interviewed with @CadeMetz for this piece. He is well 
aware that (1) I was the CEO of Parity and incorporated it, and (2) I didna€™t just a€~build a 
toola€™ and move from a (nameless) role at Accenture to a (nameless) role at Twitter. He 
acknowledges this in the signal chats I am having with him. I explicitly asked
him    if he agreed with the context of the article. His response was to have a conversation to 
a€oeexplain how we put a story together and the (very careful) choices we make.aCD I will not 
entertain a conversation where I have to convince someone that my work deserves credit. This is not 
a matter of opinion, this is a matter of facts. I will also not entertain another conversation 
where I prove my worth to someone AS THEY SHOWCASE MY WORK. This is
how people get erased. The history of Parity, as codified by the NYT, is that someone else started 
it. Ia€™ m a footnote that barely existed. This is what VCs will see. This is what potential 
clients will see. This is what the amazing future press will talk about. Because, mark my words, 
Parity is going to change an already stagnating industry by introducing new ideas and new modes of 
working. The dilemma I am stuck with-do I take constant time out to validate
my existence with people like Cade? Do I take the call with him at 6pm (my first calendar opening, 
literally since 8:30am) to beg that he acknowledge my existence? Or, do I draw a line in the sand 
and refuse to acknolwedge the gate keepers of the major media outlets who seem to think that my 
work is good enough, but my name and my face arena€™t? Knowing full well that by doing so, I become 
yet another person whose work is erased over time. I know
that Liz will do everything to ensure that doesna€™ t happen. But a quick google search, and the 
Times article, will do the damage. So what, friends, do i do?
