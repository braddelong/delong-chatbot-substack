First: Real Stagflation? My Odds Now More than 50-50

I believe that Noah Smith and Neil Irwin have this right. There is now a better than even chance 
that the US economy faces something like stagflation over the next two years. I think the odds are 
that the economy could have ridden out Xi Jinping's attempts to deal with omicron while maintaining 
his "Covid zero" policy, but add onto this the war in Ukraine and its effect on world energy and 
food prices, and the feds ability to thread the needle looks much much
weaker:

Noah Smith: China, Russia, & the Inflation Situation: a€~Neil Irwin tweeteda€! a€oeWea€™re 
currently living in the brief moment between when Finance/Econ Twitter has realized that the new 
Covid lockdowns in Shenzhen are going to have hugely bad consequences for US inflation, but that 
has not yet become a widely-reported conventional wisdom.aCD Hea€™ s righta€!. We thought we had 
inflation basically contained. The Fed

had announced a series of rate hikesaC! Covid relief snendinaaC! has dried nn As a result inflation 
e.xnectations moderated Rut thena^! Vladimir Putina^™ s unnrovoked invasion of T TkraineaC! the 
resulting sanrtionsaC! raisincr the. nrir.es of oil aas and wheata^! FAndl now we have the. return

Antoine Bertheau & al.: The Unequal Cost of Job Loss Across Countries: a€~Studying the consequences 
of job loss can help us understand the extent to which labour markets efficiently reallocate 
unemployed workers to new jobs. Using a dataset that combines administrative records from seven 
countries with diverse labour market institutions, this column finds that the consequences of 
losing onea€™ s job vary across countries. Workers in Denmark and
Sweden experience the lowest earnings declines following job loss, while workers in Italy, Spain, 
and Portugal experience losses three times as high. Labour market institutions have the potential 
to mitigate these differencesa€!

Daniel Kuehn: War & Racial Liberalism in Europe: a€~Misesa€™ s commitment to liberal economics,

is upheld but only for a€oepeoples of the white race.a€D Free trade and a€oethe open door for 
economic activitya€D are championed globally by Mises, even outside Europe, but non-white capacity
