Bankman-Fried built his structure up carefully—a dorky “genius” techie that had made a magic money machine, but legitimately this time, and because he showed the right signs, people gave him more and more money. Changpeng Zhao (AKA CZ, CEO of Binance) of Binance<a href="https://beincrypto.com/changpeng-zhao-played-me-carefully-thought-out-plan-sam-bankman-fried/"> called his bluff</a>, because he <em>too</em> was this kind of monster…. CZ, much like Bankman-Fried, always assumed he was one step ahead. He believed that doing this would flush Sam from the industry, all while Binance kept the market stable enough for the bad news to pass as it had so many times, except… it didn’t. And now their auditor is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/16/audit-firm-mazars-ceases-proof-of-reserves-work-for-binance-and-others/"> so concerned about the validity of their analysis that they’ve pulled Binance’s audit and stopped working in crypto entirely</a>.… </p><p>What happens with Binance is anyone’s guess. They are likely some form of insolvent, though it’s not obvious if that means “we have the equivalent of assets” or “we do not have enough of anything.” But it’s not great when you have to<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/crypto-exchange-binance-temporarily-halts-usdc-stablecoin-withdrawals.html"> pause withdrawals of a major stablecoin</a> because people have been trying to pull billions of dollars at once, something that would not be an issue if you, say, had those billions of dollars sitting in your exchange… He also didn’t realize that his best scenario would be to keep Bankman-Fried and FTX’s problems as quiet as possible….</p><p><strong>Zucknarök: </strong>As I wrote in<a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/the-year-of-finding-out"> The Year Of Finding Out</a>, 2022 has been an era where we have seen… “<a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/the-death-of-the-boy-genius">geniuses</a>”… revealed as at best situationally intelligent and at worst <em>ruinously stupid at the only time it counts…. </em><a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/mark-zuckerberg-is-going-to-kill">I still believe Mark Zuckerberg will kill his company</a>…. I cannot imagine that Meta exists in the form it does today if Zuckerberg continues to push “the metaverse.” The technology is not there yet…. <a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/mark-zuckerberg-is-a-liar-and-hes">He thought he was Steve Jobs</a>, but he’s really Gil Amelio.</p><p><strong>Elondämmerung: </strong>At the precipice of self-inflicted destruction sits Elon Musk… [who] has proven himself to be a petty charlatan who lacks any meaningful skills necessary to run a company…. [It] is more likely that SpaceX and Tesla have <em>survived</em> his tenure as CEO rather than thrived under his leadership. The current state of Twitter is fascinating because it is the most conspicuous analysis of a company we’ve ever seen, one that has revealed exactly how little a Chief Executive can know, how foolishly a Chief Executive can act, and how ignorant one very rich man can be…. Musk<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/?sh=31e4a7237999"> owns 25% of Tesla between stock and options and has pledged more than half of it as collateral for loans</a>, and much of his wealth (currently $209 billion) appears to come from the <em>private</em> valuations of companies like SpaceX and The Boring Company…. Rivian, Cadillac, Ford, Audi and other auto manufacturers are creating better-looking vehicles at similar (or cheaper) price points…. </p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/?sh=31e4a7237999">Forbes reports</a> that Musk’s wealth was $24 billion in 2020, ballooning to $155 billion in 2021—a Bankman-Fried adjacent pumping <em><strong>based entirely on Tesla’s stock value and trust in the valuations of private (and in some cases pre-revenue) companies run by Elon Musk.</strong></em> If you begin to question how well Tesla, or SpaceX, or The Boring Company (<a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2022/11/119988-detailing-boring-companys-poor-track-record">which is better known for abandoning projects than completing them</a>) are run, it’s fair to consider whether he’s worth all that much to begin with…. Musk’s entire fortune—his entire <em>existence—</em>is fueled by hype and trust in his genius… not altogether different from Sam Bankman-Fried…. He will never <em>not</em> be a billionaire, but I would be shocked if his wealth doesn’t return to something more like he had in 2019 or 2020...</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2022-12-23-fr?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2022-12-23-fr?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>ONE VIDEO: <strong>LibTard Propaganda from the 1960s!:</strong></h3><p>• <strong>Joseph Manckieics</strong> <strong>(Director) &amp; Rod Serling (Writer)</strong> (1964): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbp1du33l0c">A Carol for Another Christmas</a>:</p><div id="youtube2-gbp1du33l0c" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;gbp1du33l0c&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gbp1du33l0c?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>Courtesy of Roy Edroso:</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:92415563,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://edroso.substack.com/p/have-a-cold-war-liberal-christmas&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:2645,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Roy Edroso Breaks It Down&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2b422fde-d73c-4750-86c1-4a40b8b33fee_256x256.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Have a Cold War liberal Christmas! &quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Here we are in A Christmas Carol season.

This meant that inflation rose more and was more permanent than what it might have been…. A theorist of monetary policy who is thinking about economic mechanisms saw a lot of red flags and worried that the 5 per cent would persist. Empirics is wonderful when we’re in a stable and steady regime; theory is what you need when you have big shocks and possible regime changes…. The big forecast errors of “team transitory” 18 months ago seemed to come from putting too much emphasis on micro data and so mistaking the forest for the trees…. If we had raised rates earlier, we wouldn’t have had so much inflation now…. Firms, wage setters, price setters, speculators, professionals at banks, everyone thinks that inflation is going to be at 2 per cent in the medium-term. A recession was always going to happen for the eurozone and UK which are large net importers of energy. There’s not much that central banks could do about that…. Then, later, as inflation comes down close to 2 per cent, are there good reasons to ask whether… [we should] have an inflation target of 3 per cent? The answer is probably yes….
