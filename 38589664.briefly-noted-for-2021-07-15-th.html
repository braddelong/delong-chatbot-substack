But how do we replace it with something that does what it does without being a similar center for destructive grifting and brain-hacking?:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Brian Stelter</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Authors of New Book Depict ‘Facebook’s Dilemma &amp; Its Ugly Truth’</em>: ‘“No Filter” author Sarah Frier, who was tasked with reviewing “An Ugly Truth” for The Times, says the book documents a clear pattern: “The social media behemoth does as little as possible to prevent disasters from happening, then feebly attempts to avoid blame and manage public appearances.” That’s why the back cover of the book cleverly lists the company’s apologias over the years: “I’m sorry.” “We need to do better.” “We need to do a better job.” The authors conclude that “even if the company undergoes a radical transformation in the coming years, that change is unlikely to come from within.” Why? Because “the algorithm that serves as Facebook’s beating heart is too powerful and too lucrative. And the platform is built upon a fundamental, possibly irreconcilable dichotomy: its purported mission to advance society by connecting people while also profiting off them. It is Facebook’s dilemma and its ugly truth.”… “This is a book intended to make you outraged at Facebook,” Frier wrote in her review. “But if you’ve read anything about the company in recent years, you probably already are. Frenkel and Kang faced the challenge of unearthing new and interesting material about one of the most heavily debated communication tools of our modern age. More than 400 interviews later, they’ve produced the ultimate takedown via careful, comprehensive interrogation of every major Facebook scandal. ‘An Ugly Truth’ provides the kind of satisfaction you might get if you hired a private investigator to track a cheating spouse: It confirms your worst suspicions and then gives you all the dates and details you need to cut through the company’s spin”…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/media/facebook-reliable-sources/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/media/facebook-reliable-sources/index.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-15-th?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-15-th?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Ben S Bernanke, Olivier Blanchard, Lawrence H.

Shirer, who witnessed a 1934 Nazi rally in Nuremberg, would link the criminality of individuals to communal frenzy…. Why? Why had Germany, long one of the most ostensibly civilized, highly educated societies on earth, transformed itself into an instrument that turned a continent into a charnel house? Why had Germany delivered itself over to the raving exterminationist dictates of one man, the man Shirer refers to disdainfully as a “vagabond”? Why did the world allow a “tramp,” a Chaplinesque figure whose 1923 beer hall putsch was a comic fiasco, to become a genocidal Führer whose rule spanned a continent and threatened to last a thousand years? Why? William Shirer offered a 1,250-page answer. It wasn’t a final answer… but Shirer reminded the world of “what”: what happened to civilization and humanity in those years…. He was one of a number of courageous American reporters who filed copy under the threat of censorship and expulsion, a threat that sought to prevent them from detailing the worst excesses, including the murder of Hitler’s opponents, the beginnings of the Final Solution and the explicit preparations for upcoming war. After war broke out, he covered the savagery of the German invasion of Poland and followed the Wehrmacht as it fought its way into Paris before he was forced to leave in December 1940…. Writing&nbsp;<em>The Rise and Fall</em>&nbsp;was an extraordinary act of… literary-historical generalship—to conquer a veritable continent of information… that terrain of horror in a mere 1,250 pages…. Rereading the book, one sees how subtle Shirer is in shifting between telescope and microscope—even, one might say, stethoscope…. Perhaps one corollary that almost need not be spelled out: There is danger in giving up our sense of selfhood for the illusory unity of a frenzied mass movement, of devolving from human to herd for some homicidal abstraction…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/revisiting-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-third-reich-20231221/">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/revisiting-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-third-reich-20231221/</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Matthew Yglesias &amp; Dara Lind</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Time Machine: Volcker Shock</em>: ‘Vox’s Dylan Matthews joins Matt and Dara for another step into Weeds Time Machine: a visit to the past to review some now-forgotten chapter in policy history.

It’s twice as easy to catch,” he says. “But for people who are vaccinated… the vaccines are very, very effective, particularly against getting sick. And so there’s nothing that’s really shaking my confidence in that.”… Slavitt says he’s relaxed around mask-use, except when he has to travel…. Slavitt says throughout the pandemic, the U.S. was unable to combat the virus because communities were divided, especially when people’s vulnerability level to COVID dictated their lives. He refers to it as “the room service pandemic.”… Slavitt says the country suffered because of former President Donald Trump’s dismissive attitudes toward the pandemic. He explains that Trump was motivated by his selfishness and desire to be seen as a winner…. When Trump announced he wanted to reopen the economy by Easter, Slavitt says he and Jared Kushner worked together to persuade the president to push back the date…. “But sadly, he only delayed until the end of April… the state authority handoff, which they believed would allow them to escape accountability when things inevitably went wrong.”… Slavitt explains that whenever someone dissented about the handling of the pandemic, the Trump administration fired them or silenced them. He shares a moment where former Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar wanted to add the phrase “but things might rapidly change” to an otherwise positive pandemic report that would be shared on “Fox &amp; Friends.” Slavitt says that when the White House communications team learned of the phrase, he was pulled from the show and they forbade the DHHS from talking to the public for 45 days…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/film-coronavirus-response/andy-slavitt-preventable-book">https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/film-coronavirus-response/andy-slavitt-preventable-book</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Marianne Ward &amp; John Devereux</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Road Not Taken: Pre-Revolutionary Cuban Living Standards in Comparative Perspective</em>: ‘Cuba was once a prosperous middle-income economy.
