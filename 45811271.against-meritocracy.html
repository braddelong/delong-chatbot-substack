In the limit, you optimize for test-takers—and people who have devoted all of their time to become expert test-takers have spent none of their time learning to do anything else. They are thus likely to be far from “the best” at what will be their real job.</p><p>How can you tell if you are falling into this trap? Divide your population up into groups. See how well the best test-takers are spread out among those groups, If there is no reason to think that those who will actually be best at the real job are anything other than uniformly distributed among the groups you have chosen, and yet if it turns out that those who score highest on the test are strongly concentrated—then it is highly likely that you are missing huge numbers of potential candidates, and wasting a huge amount of talent.</p><p>Rajiv Sethi ran across a very interesting paper on Finland that is on point here:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Rajiv Sethi</strong>: <em>Notes on a Remarkable Finding from Finland</em>: ‘Ursina Schaede and Ville Mankki….

Before then, humans were indeed anthology intelligences—what one person knew, as soon pretty much everyone in the band knew, because of our incredible and sometimes regrettable compulsion to talk and gossip even when we know it will not be a to our long-run advantage. But they were short-run short-distance anthology intelligences. knowledge is limited and evanescent: what one band new had a hard time diffusing over great distances, and what was not immediately useful could and did decay and be lost over the centuries. With civilization and more so with writing, we became a global-scale time-binding singular anthology intelligence. And that mattered greatly.</p><p>From year -5000 to year -1, we could see more people chattering and communicating leading to faster advances in ideas. Faster advances in useful ideas supported faster population growth through Malthusian forces. Faster population growth produced a greater human population base. That in turn produced more chattering and communicating and even faster advances in ideas. We thus think we have a human population with a proportional growth rate that more than doubles from 0.03%/year to 0.06%/year, comparing the -3000 to -1000 Bronze Age with the -1000 to 1 Iron Age, what some call the “Axial Age” of humanity.</p><p>(2) But then there comes a second watershed-boundary crossing. It comes not after 1 but rather after 170: the Late-Antiquity Pause. We do not see another doubling of the rate of ideas and of population growth. Instead, after 170… things kinda fall apart. Dark Ages. Imperial decline and fall. Barbarian invasions. Emperors desperate to protect their realms making unwise deals with barbarian warlords with names like Alaric the Visigoth and An Lushan the Sogdian. Rather than a breakthrough out of Malthusian near-stagnation, the years from 1 to 800 see a decline in the ideas growth rate back to 0.016% per year, Apparently slower than anything seen since the -5000 coming of “civilization”.</p><p>But after 800 things recover. We think we see, worldwide, the same proportional ideas growth rate from 800-1500 as we saw from -1000 to 1: 0.06%/year. And technology is at a higher level: it would have taken, on average, more than two workers in -1000 to do what one worker could do in 800. (Living standards on average did not rise, however: with 4.5 times as many people in 800 as had been in -1000, farm sizes were smaller.) On the other hand, even with 220 million people around in 800, their ability to think up new useful ideas did not exceed the ability of the 50 million people around in -1000.</p><p>Then, in 1500 and after, comes a triple breakthrough:</p><p>(3) The third watershed-boundary crossing comes in 1500 with the arrival of the Imperial-Commercial Age. 1500-1770 sees a 2.5-fold amplification ideas growth over the previous Agrarian-Age norm. Human living standards do not rise by very much—Malthusian pressures are still strong, and so the little rise in typical living standards for those not at the sharp edge of imperial-commercial globalization brings forth a previously unprecedented 50% rise in human population over the period. But 1500-1770 does see as much advance in the deployment of useful ideas in the human economy as over all the technological progress of the preceding 500 to 1500 millennium.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F701e0aee-4f7d-4432-83bc-772f3ed1326f_1422x1200.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F701e0aee-4f7d-4432-83bc-772f3ed1326f_1422x1200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F701e0aee-4f7d-4432-83bc-772f3ed1326f_1422x1200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F701e0aee-4f7d-4432-83bc-772f3ed1326f_1422x1200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F701e0aee-4f7d-4432-83bc-772f3ed1326f_1422x1200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/701e0aee-4f7d-4432-83bc-772f3ed1326f_1422x1200.png" width="1100" height="928" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/701e0aee-4f7d-4432-83bc-772f3ed1326f_1422x1200.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:928,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:214087,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F701e0aee-4f7d-4432-83bc-772f3ed1326f_1422x1200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F701e0aee-4f7d-4432-83bc-772f3ed1326f_1422x1200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F701e0aee-4f7d-4432-83bc-772f3ed1326f_1422x1200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F701e0aee-4f7d-4432-83bc-772f3ed1326f_1422x1200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>(4) Then comes the fourth British Industrial Revolution watershed-boundary crossing around 1770, and the British Industrial Revolution Age 1770-1870. The already unprecedented Imperial-Commercial Age rate of global technological progress triples. From 1770-1870, useful and productive technologies for manipulating nature and organizing humans invented, discovered, developed, deployed, and diffused across the human world economy advance so fast that a typical decade sees change that you would have had to wait a typical century to see over the epoch -1000 to 1500. The Malthusian Devil is still in control: the world population nearly doubled from 1770 to 1870, with smaller farm sizes almost but not quite offsetting the potential benefits better technology offered for human living standards.(5</p><p>(5) And then the fifth ands—so far—final watershed-boundary crossing around 1870, bringing us into our Modern Economic Growth Age. A further more-than-quadrupling of the pace of ideas growth. Now one typical year sees the progress that took 50 years on average over -1000 to 1500. In a generation human deployed and diffused technological prowess doubles. And then in the next generation it doubles again. Such a pace of creative destruction, overturning the foundational technological and economic underpinnings of society, has never been seen before. It characterizes our age.</p><p>Then there is a natural next question: What happens next?</p><p>We think that world population is likely to top out at between 9 and 10 billion. Suppose that thereafter we attain zero population growth. If we suppose further that the pace of technological progress continues at the roughly 2%/year seen since 1870, that gives us a <em>ca</em>.-2100 world in which the typical standard of living is some $70,000 of our dollars per year—the level of, say, Greater San Francisco today. Manifestly, that is not enough wealth to build a true utopia. But it is enough wealth to make a society wealthy and comfortable indeed. (Although we do not know how much of that wealth will have to be committed to global warming adaptation and remediation.)</p><p>Another century of similar growth at a stable world population would give us a <em>ca</em>.-2200 world in which the average person lives, well, better than I do: an average could with $1,000,000 a year to devote to their projects and goals. I can see, barely, how a typical person could use such wealth.</p><p>But project forward another 300 years—if technological progress has not come to a stop there is no more fruit, even high-hanging fruit, to be picked—and we see a <em>ca</em>.-2500 world in which the typical living standard is not far from $200,000,000 a year, and in which every day the typical person has $500,000 of resources to spend making themself comfortable and advancing whatever their current projects might happen to be.</p><p>I really have a hard time contemplating what such a world would look like…</p>
