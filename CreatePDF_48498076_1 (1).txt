A new book by a former chairman of the US Council of Economic Advisers under Republican President 
George W. Bush sounds as though it could have been written by a social democrat. There is common 
ground in the recognition that mass flourishing requires participation, not protectionism.

Thanks for reading this. And please share it far and wide, if you think it worth reading!

BERKELEY a€“ In the history of modernity, the real sea change came in 1870, with what the Nobel 
laureate economist Simon Kuznets calleda€oeModern Economic Growth.aGD Since then, humanitya€™ s 
technological capabilities have roughly doubled every 35 years or so, revolutionizing the economy 
with each generation, and then revolutionizing it again with the next one.

Combined with the market economy and modern capitalism, technological progress has given rise to 
extraordinarily efficient new ways of making old and new things. But if your life was centered 
around making old things the old way, you learned the hard way what Joseph Schumpeter meant when he 
called modern capitalism a€oethe perennial gale of creative destruction.a€D Moreover, in a market 
society, the technological forces driving the
a€oedestructiona€n tend to be amplified, because property rights are the only things that matter, 
and some property rights turn out to be more valuable than others.

This naturally creates social and political tensions. People generally believe that they should 
have more, and more varied, rights than merely those conferred by property ownership. As such, 
there is prevailing disillusionment with the message of the past few decades, which has amounted 
to: a€oeThe market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the market.a€D

Now comes The Wall and the Bridge: Fear and Opportunity in Disruptiona€™ s Wake, by the thoughtful 
ex-neoliberal economist Glenn Hubbard. A chairman of the US Council of Economic Advisers under 
President George W. Bush, Hubbard reflects on what has happened to the US economy since he started 
studying economics back in 1977. Since then, a€oetechnological change and globalization have 
magnified the market value of my skills anda€![those of
other] professionals. Meanwhile, the closure of Youngstowna€™ s integrated steel mills did not lead 
to moonshot efforts toward the preparation and reconnection of many workers and communities for the 
changing economy.a€D

He closes with a vision of the better road not taken: a€oelmagine if bold support for community 
colleges and training would match the preparation and reconnection of the G.I. Bill as America was 
encouraging global integration. Imagine if leaderships [moved political debate toward economic 
participations! Imagine mass flourishing SD

Reading this, my memory flashes back not to 1977 but to 1993.1 am in the White House Roosevelt 
Room, and the voice I hear is not Glenn HubbardS™ s but then-Secretary of Labor Robert ReichS™ s. 
He is touching on all the same themes. Technology and globalization offer far-reaching benefits, 
Reich notes, but they also increase the risk of some people being left behind. Accordingly, we 
should build bridges to help people move to the sectors that will
define the new economy. What we should not do is build walls to protect the industries that will be 
rendered unproductive by the forces of creative destruction. (At this point, I also hear the voice 
of then-Vice President Al Gore, who is keen to spend federal money to create the backbone of what 
would become the internet of the 1990s S“ the ultimate bridge to mass flourishing in the 
twenty-first century.)

Working under Secretaries of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen and Robert Rubin, we told Reich something 
along these lines: See Yes, youS™ re right. But it canS™ t be done now. American voters are angry. 
We need to raise taxes on the rich, put the budget deficit on a path toward zero, and generate an 
economic recovery based on high investment and high productivity growth. WeS™ 11 address many of 
those issues this year, and next year we will do NAFTA
(the North American Free Trade Agreement). We can turn to bridge building and social democracy 
afterward.SD

Reich lost that policy debate, and the Clinton administration never did get around to pursuing 
social democracy, bridge building, or mass flourishing. We could have taken that road, but the 
Republicans retook the House of Representatives and embarked on a scorched-earth campaign of 
obstructionism under Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.

We would have liked to have Hubbard on our side in the policy debates that followed the so-called 
Republican Revolution of 1994. See We economists,SD he writes, Scehave let the public debate drift 
to the opposite extremes of building walls and a laissez-faire optimism about change and markets 
making everything OKSD Reading that, I canS™ t help but think of TontoS™ s response to the Lone 
Ranger: SoeWhat do you mean a€'we,a€™
kemosabe?SD

Recounting the Republican Party debate that he participated in, Hubbard notes that Trade Adjustment 
Assistance a€oecame up as a policy topic only when new trade expansions were sought.a€D Otherwise, 
a€oeit received little sustained attention or interest in its augmentation.a€D Here, my response 
is, a€oeGlenn, you are late to the party !a€D

Fortunately, he has brought great refreshments to make up for his tardiness, making me wish that I 
had had his book in hand six months ago, before finalizing my own forthcoming book, Slouching 
Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Twentieth Century. Indeed, the intellectual landmarks 
Hubbard references are largely the same as mine: Karl Polanyi, Friedrich Hayek, John Maynard Keynes.
All told, Hubbard has it right. Populists want to build walls, but what we need a€“ even more than 
we did three decades ago a€“ are bridges.
