John Ball (1381):

a€oeWhen Adam delved and Eve span/Who was then the gentleman?a€D From the beginning all men by 
nature were created alike, and our bondage or servitude came in by the unjust oppression of naughty 
men. For if God would have had any bondmen from the beginning, he would have appointed who should 
be bond, and
who free. And therefore I exhort you to consider that now the time is come, appointed to us by God, 
in which ye may (if ye will) cast off the yoke of bondage, and recover libertya€!

Children

You need to understand three things to grasp the historical state of the world economy, even as 
late as 1870:

1. that the drive to make love is one of the very strongest of all human drives,

2. that living standards were what we would regard as very low for the bulk of humanity in the long 
trek between the invention of agriculture to 1870, and

3. that the rate of global and even leading-nation technological progress up to 1870a€”even in the 
heat of the Industrial Revolution itselfa€”was, by our standards, glacial.

Before the coming of abundant and relatively reliable means of artificial birth control at the end 
of the nineteenth century, making love is followed almost invariably if not immediately by 
childrena€”over a lifetime, lots of children. And once humans have children that they survive and 
flourish becomes the most important thing for almost every parent
for two reason:

(1) You love them almost as much as and in some cases more than yourself. Recall Hektora€™ s prayer 
for his son Astyanax (a prayer that Hera and Athene worked very hard to make certain that Zeus did 
not grant):

Zeus, grant that this my child may be, like me, first among the Trojans. Let him be not less 
excellent in strength. Let him rule Ilius with his might. And may the people say of him as he comes 
home from battle: a€oeHe is far better than his father!a€D

(2) If you survive into your old age you will need someone to take care of you, and the only people 
likely to be willing to take care of you are your descendants. With infant and child mortality 
rates of 50% and life expectancies of less than thirty years, lots of pregnancies is the only way 
to be reasonably sure that you will have a still-living child when
you                                                                                                 
                                                              go blind and toothless. For women, 
especially, living sons and grandsons are about the only source of social power you can have back 
in the days of high patriarchy. In a slowly-growing population, the average number of surviving 
sons per woman is just over 1. That means 30% wind up with no surviving sons: that risk is a 
powerful motivator for
women to keep trying to have more children.

Thus human populationsa€”back before widespread female literacy enlarged the options open to women, 
back before the fall in infant mortality created the expectation that your children would survive 
to grow up, back before widespread artificial birth control allowed women to have the number of 
children they wanted and not morea€”tended to grow
until something stopped them.

Pre-Industrial Living Standards

Living standards were what we would regard as very low for the bulk of humanity throughout the long 
trek between the invention of agriculture around -8000 and 1870.

Hunting and Gathering

Take the WABAC machine back further, to ten thousand years ago, to the eve of the invention of 
agriculture, to when hunter-gatherers inhabited the world. Biomedically our hunter-gatherer 
ancestors appear to have been about as healthy as we in the modern world are through early middle 
agea€”if they survived to early middle age, that is. Life
expectancy at birth was twenty-five on a generous estimate. The average adult height of 
mesolithica€”i.e., the period that ended 10,000 years agoa€’’hunter-gatherers appears to have been 
about 5a€™ 8a€D for men and 5a€™ 5a€D for women, perhaps a hair less than average adult height in 
the rich postindustrial economies today. Our hunter-gatherer
ancestors were, plausibly, better-nourished than we are today: even in the richest countries today 
diets are tilted toward high-caloric density carbohydratesa€”rice, wheat, corn, and 
potatoesa€’’relative to nutritional requirements.

As a hunter-gatherer you lived a well-nourished, physically-strenuous life that kept you fit, and 
was at least moderately interesting in the day-to-day puzzles that you had to solve. 
Hunter-gatherers avoided the mind-numbing boredom of doing the same thing over and over again to 
the next row of the same crop, what Karl Marx called the a€oeidiocy of
rural life.a€D But there was a downside. Hunter-gatherer nutritional standards were adequate and 
diets were varied in large part because population densities were low and foraging territories 
relatively large. Population densities were low because mortality was ferocious. You got to watch 
your friends die, your spouse die, your comrades die, worst of
all  a large fraction of your children die, and then you died at a relatively young age.

How ferocious was mortality? A pre-industrial nutritionally-unstressed human population with access 
to the technologies of settlements ’’building walls, roofs, and chimneys and weaving and sewing 
clothesa€”will roughly double in population every twenty-five years. That is what the British 
settlers in America did in the generations after they hit the
coast from Georgia to Maine. But human hunter-gatherer populations before agriculture grew from 
perhaps a hundred thousand people fifty-thousand years ago to perhaps 5 million people ten-thousand 
years ago. That is a rate of increase of 0.01% per year: each generation sees not twice as many 
people as its parent generation, but rather only a quarter


of a percent morea€”one extra person for each 400.

And even though life was not that of boring routinized repetitive labor, it was not what we would 
call comfortable: you spent a not-small part of your life hungry, cold (or too hot), or wet.
Now jump forward again to 1870. How did living standards in 1870 compare to those ten thousand 
years ago?

From -8000 to 1870

A reasonable view of what we think of as a€oematerial well-beinga€n classifies basic human needs 
and desires as sixfold:

• to watch your grandchildren (or your great-nieces and nephews or your protA©gA©s) grow up,

• to have enough food that you are not too hungry,

• to have enough clothing that you are not too cold,

• to have enough shelter that you are not too wet,

• to have enough conceptual puzzles and diversions that you are not too bored, and

• to have enough status that you can gloat at the envy of others (at least in private).

By that yardstick we in the world economya€™ s core today rank ahead of our hunter-gatherer 
ancestors on five of these six dimensions. (The sixtha€’’relative statusa€”is, alas!, conserved: 
you cannot generate it from some without taking it away from others, and so there we are stuck at 
an equal average level.) But back in 1870 people (with the
exception of the literate upper classes) by and large did not do so. The upper classes of 1870 were 
certainly more comfortable and probably led richer and more interesting lives than the Clan of the 
Cave Bear did. But the illiterate peasants of the world in 1870 probably did not do so

1870 saw no greater life expectancy than people in -8000 Infant and adult mortality in agricultural 
and commercial societies is no lower than in hunter-gatherer ones. Mortality may well be higher for 
adults, because plagues and famines like dense human populations. Bacteria do not care (much) if 
their rapid growth kills their hosts as long as that
happens only after they have found a new host to jump to. And denser populations terribly 
vulnerable to famine, either through blight or through weathera€”too hot or too cold, too wet or 
too drya€”adverse to the growth of whatever the staple happens to be.

An agricultural cereal-heavy diet does not contain enough iron to avoid anemia. It does not contain 
enough calcium to avoid tooth loss and bone weakness. Romea€™ s legions were paid in bread and a 
little salta€”thata€™ s what a€cesalarya€D means. Add to this whatever meat they could find and 
whatever greens and seasonings they could gather,
and you had the diet of the legionaries, collectively at least the most powerful group of men of 
their age. They wear highly-skilled practitioners of violence. They were mean. They were also 
short. And they were, by what we would regard as early middle age, largely toothless.

Have we mentioned endemic hookworm, tapeworm, and other parasites yet? Or that agricultural and 
commercial labor likely involves heavy lifting-and-carrying labor that damages your spine? Or that 
the relatively high population densities create greater vulnerability to infectious diseases that 
debilitate even when they do not kill?

In 1870 agricultural and commercial societies people were short. Average adult male heights of 5a€™ 
3a€D or 5a€™4a€D (and adult female heights averaging 4a€™ lla€D or so) appear to have been the rule 
for humanity once we started to farm. This indicates extraordinary malnutrition by our standards. 
If my wife and I had fed our boy and girl a
diet to produce adult heights of 5a€™ 3a€D and 5a€™ 0a€D respectively, Alameda County Child 
Protective Services would have long since came and taken my children away, and I would never have 
seen them again.

Real Wages to 1870

Robert Allen has been the head of a large team that has compiled the scanty information we have on 
the wages of unskilled laborers across the big cities of Eurasia from 1350 to 1900. Their wages are 
real wages: a value of one means that an adult male laborer employed full time, full year could 
earn just enough to keep his family of six or so at
biological subsistence^”1940 calories per adult male per day, most of it on the cheapest 
carbohydrate sold in that city, with only tiny amounts spent on a€oeluxuriesa€n (rent, wood for 
burning, oil, and meat). Their workers of London and Amsterdam on these budgets are eating oatmeal 
two meals a day, the workers of Vienna are eating rye, the
workers of Delhi are eating millet, the workers of Beijing are eating sorghum, and the workers of 
Florence are eating polenta over and over again.

There are three subtleties of interpretation. The first is that biological subsistence is not 
sociological subsistence. The workers of London in 1600 did not spend 1/3 of their income on 
a€cenecessitiesa€D and have two-thirds left over for luxuries, for they did not want to eat oatmeal 
two meals a day and in fact did not eat oatmeal two meals a day. Oats
were, as famously defined by Samuel Johnson, a€oea grain that in England is fed to horses and in 
Scotland is fed to men.a€D The Scots had a replya€”a€oeThat is the reason that England breeds such 
fine horses, and Scotland breeds such fine men.a€D But an English laborer of 1600 would have been 
as humiliated to be forced by penury to eat like a
Scotsmana€”oatmeala€”as a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2003 would have 
been as humiliated to be forced to eat French fries.

The second is that these wage level calculations assume that you could have found work all the 
time, which seasonal labor requirement patterns and commercial and political disruptions made 
chancy at best.

The third is that these are the wages that were paid to urban workers hired for the day. These are 
the wages of those whose connections with their employers were overwhelmingly short-term cash-nexus 
connections. Such people are not in general representative of society as a whole even today, and 
were definitely not in general representative back in
the past. In rapidly-growing cities like fourteenth-century Florence, fifteenth-century Vienna, 
sixteenth-century Amsterdam, seventeenth-century Delhi, or eighteenth-century London, the day 
laborers were people from the countryside pulled into the city by the chance to make extra bucks 
who sell their labor-power to employers who see opportunity
and dona€™ t have enough in the way of serfs or apprentices or liegemen to handle the workload. In 
cities like nineteenth-century Delhi, Beijing, or Florence, the urban day laborers were people who 
have been pushed out of the countryside by the lack of land or a place and have washed up on the 
shores of the city to five by their wits or starve. Italy in
1850 was not a country in which the average person subsisted on 1600 calories of polenta per adult 
male equivalent per day.

That said, the pattern that Allen et al. paint is clear and convincing. They pick up the story in 
the aftermath of the Black Death of the mid-fourteenth centurya€”the bubonic plague. With the 
population of Europe down by between a quarter and a half from its early fourteenth-century 
medieval high, larger farm sizes produced an agricultural bonanza for
peasants who could (a) produce more and (b) bargain for lower feudal rents from an Earl of Pembroke 
desperate to have somebody working the land to pay something. Urban plague mortality had been 
highest. City employers were thus desperate to pay through the nose, and urban unskilled day 
laborers typically earned three times the biological
a€oesubsistencea€D family wage.

By 1600, however, Allen et al. find that urban unskilled day-laborer real wages are much lower. 
Italy and Austria have filled up with people, farm sizes are smaller, and the shift of trade from 
the Mediterranean to the Atlantic has advantage Amsterdam and London at the expense of Florence. 
Neither Florence nor Vienna was anymore a good place to be
an unskilled day laborer and try to raise a family. Allen et al. do, however, pick up early-Moghul 
Delhi, which then looked a lot like London: a rapidly-growing capital city in a rich agricultural 
region that benefited from the global trade-war-and-conquest boom set off by the invention of the 
sea-going caravel and the voyages of Christopher Colombus
and Vasco da Gama. And by the eighteenth century Delhi has joined Florence, Viennaa€”and mid-Qing 
Beijinga€”as places where the lot of a masterless man trying to raise a family was very bad indeed. 
And we think that this roughly tracks what was going on in the countryside as well: people were 
still on net moving from the countryside to
Florence, Vienna, Delhi, and Beijing, which means that the lot of a youngest son or of someone 
whose lineage had lost out in a dispute over land ownership out in the countryside was even worse.

London and Amsterdam are the only cities in Allen et al£€™ s dataset that managed to avoid the 
dismal Malthusian fate. Their workers did not have to subsist on oatmeal year-in year-out (or 
millet, or sorghum, or polenta) but due to the commercial-revolution expansion of the world trading 
economy plus a little successful imperialism could eat bread
instead of oatmeal, buy beef and beer on a regular basis, wear better clothes, purchase stimulants 
like sugar and tea, and evena€”after the Protestant Reformation which made literacy a duty because 
reading the Bible was storing up treasure in heavena€’’books.

Why then the Transition to Agriculture?

Comparing the lifestyle of hunter-gatherers ten thousand to that of illiterate peasant farmers a 
hundred and fifty years ago raises an obvious question: why would people ever become farmers? Jared 
Diamond claims that we shoulda€”even in the United States, even todaya€”envy our hunter-gatherer 
ancestors. I dona€™ t buy this: I do not, or at least I
think we should not, envy them. (He does not either: Full Professors of Physiology at UCLA and of 
Economics at U.C. Berkeley have chosen a life far, far removed from that of our ancestors.) But 
there is an important kernel here: almost all of our agricultural and commercial-era ancestors 
between -8000 and 1870 or later did have good reason to envy
our common pre-industrial ancestors. We understand why the transition from hunting and gathering to 
pre-industrial agriculture is good for those at the top of the pyramid. But why do those not at the 
top of the socioeconomic pyramid go along?

The First Generations to Farm

Most important, is that the first generation to farma€”or to adopt any of the many subsequent 
agricultural productivity-multiplying innovationsa€”does live the life of Riley, off the fat of the 
land. If you can figure out how to do it, it is good for you and your children and your chldrena€™ 
s children to farm. But a well-fed and well-nourished population
multiplies. So farming population densities explode far beyond hunter-gatherer densities.

Some human populations did not pursue the agricultural road. Some settled into a halfway role as 
nomadic or transhumant herders following their flocks on land that was, for the time and given the 
available biotechnology, marginal for settled agriculture. Some remained hunter-gatherers for a 
while. But, eventually, somebody nearby had become
farmers. And the population density of the farmers grew. Hunter-gatherers rarely exceed population 
densities of one per square mile. Farmers on land that is good for their particular version of 
agricultural technology can easily support many more than a thousand in the same space. The old 
a€oeforty acres and a mulea€D for a family of six translates
into  a population density of roughly 100 per square mile. When those nearby who had become farmers 
decided that they wanted the hunter-gatherersa€™ or the herdsmena€™ s land, they took it: numbers 
of 100-to-l or 1000-to-l are not easy to argue with.

The upshot is thata€”unless you were part of the rich, literate upper classesa€”per capita 
standards of living were not that much higher in 1870 as they had been back in -8000. Population, 
however, was much greater: 1.3 billion in people in 1870, compared to 2 million or so back in 8000 
BC.

An Accountanta€™s View of Long-Run Growth

Back before 1870 the rate of technological progress in the world was, by our standards, very slow. 
Back 10000 years ago there were perhaps 2 million people alive on the earth. By 1870 there were 1.3 
billion. That is a growth rate of 0.07% per yeara€”2% per generation, 7% per century. If we are 
willing to make the heroic assumption that in a
Malthusian world where living standards are stable the rate of growth of a€cetechnologya€Da€”the 
proportional growth rate of the value of useful ideas about manipulating nature and organizing 
humans invented, discovered, developed, deployed, and diffused throughout the human economya€”is 
half the rate of population growth, that gives us
0.035% per year as the pre-1870 technology growth rate. Since 1870, worldwide, that number has been 
2.1%.

In one typical year since 1870, we have had the samea€’’relative proportionate ’’amount of 
technological progress of 60 years, one full survivora€™ s human lifespan, back before 1870. 
Technological progress was glacial before 1870, and especially so before 1770.

In the Shadow of Malthus

We can now turn this around, and figure out why income levels, living standards, and labor 
productivity levels worldwide were so stagnant from -8000 to 1870.

Positive and Preventative Checks to Population

What limited population growth so much in the pre-1870 agricultural world?

A number of things can restrain population growth. Perhaps celibacy and abstention from 
reproduction is thought of as pleasing to God. Your prospective father-in-law may tell you that you 
may not marry his daughter until you have a farm of your own, and he may be able to make that 
stick. Your older brother may tell you that you cannot bring a wife
into the lineage house until the lineage has bought an extra piece of land on which to grow food.

But most often and to the greatest extent that a€oesomethinga€D is poverty: children become too 
malnourished to fight off normal childhood diseases, women become too skinny to ovulate, and 
populations become so dense as to become giant culture dishes for endemic debilitating diseases or 
periodic epidemic mortal plagues, and so population
growth ceases. Generation-to-generation the population jumps up and down as the spread of 
agricultural techniques produces an edge in food and more children survive, as plagues and wars 
devastate provinces, and as bounceback takes place in the aftermath of plagues and famines that 
have left provinces depopulated but the survivors with large and
fertile farms.

The fact that over the long run between the invention of agriculture 10000 years ago and 1870 human 
populations grew very slowly indeed carries the implication that at most times in most places 
agricultural society life was nasty and brutish and short. Technological progress would produce a 
few generations of relative plenty, a growth in population
density to shrink the average size of farms. And then you were back on the Malthusian treadmill. 
The only exceptions were improvements in technology and organization that did not affect the rate 
of reproduction^’’either because the benefits were confined to the (numerically small) upper 
classes or because the changes came accompanied by social
changes that increased mortality. Of course, social changes that increase mortality are hardly 
improvements in quality of life, are they?

Exceptions: Eras, Customs, and Classes

Now there were exceptions: exceptional eras, exceptional customs, and exceptional groups.

Exceptional eras come in two flavors. First, there are the years, the decades, and the centuries 
after key improvements in agriculture. The iron axe that allows for the clearing of temperate 
woodlands, the heavy plow that allows successful growth of grains in otherwise clayey wet soils, 
strains of wet rice that allow two or three crops of rice a yeara€”if
you first invest in the public works needed to flood the rice paddiesa€”the caravel and the 
settlement of North America all produce times in which life for the average rural peasant, and thus 
for the average urban laborer as well, was relatively good. Second, there are the years after 
Azrael in the form of the Bubonic Plague or something similar has
visited a region, the years in which populations are much smaller than they used to, farm sizes 
much larger, living standards highera€”and populations growing to make average farm sizes lower 
once again.

Exceptional customs are social arrangements that constrain human fertility and as a result keep 
populations from growing even when people are relatively well-fed and well-nourished. The most 
obvious is the European marriage pattern: the postponement of the median age of marriage for young 
women until their early or mid twenties, because fathers
demanded that potential husbands have prospectsa€’’ownership of a farm, a workshop, a profession, a 
competence^’’before they would let their daughters out of the household. Remember Romeo and Juliet! 
Remember the exchange between Old Capulet and Count Paris at the start of Act 1, Scene 2:

CAPULET: But saying o'er what I have said before:

My child is yet a stranger in the world;

She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

PARIS: Younger than she are happy mothers made.

CAPULET: And too soon marred are those so early made.
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,

She is the hopeful lady of my earth:

But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a parta€!

Lady Capulet has different ideas. And so, soon thereafter in Shakespearea€™ s play, does Juliet. 
But the drag exercised on female age of marriage by powerful patriarchal fathers who think they 
know better than their daughters what is good for them was (a) a social force making for older ages 
at marriage, (b) fewer pregnancies at a given state of
nutrition and real income, (c) as a result a somewhat richer society, (d) much heartbreak among the 
young, and (e) most of great European literature and tragedy.

In Asia, you have a similar institution with the lineage family. If in Europe it was the father 
telling the suitor that a€oeyou cannot marry my daughter until you can support her in the style I 
want her to be accustomed to,a€D in Asia it was the older brother and lineage head telling his 
brothers, sons, and nephews that a€oeyou cannot bring a wife into this
house until we have more resources .a€D

And, worldwide, there was the exposure of daughters unwanted by their father.

Exceptional groups are the upper and to a lesser extent the middle classesa€”and there are usually 
some upper classes since the invention of agriculture. As Jared Diamond points out, such privileged 
classes require agriculture:

Besides malnutrition, starvation, and epidemic diseases, farming helped bring another curse upon 
humanity: deep class divisions. Hunter-gatherers have little or no stored food, and no concentrated 
food sources, like an orchard or a herd of cows: they live off the wild plants and animals they 
obtain each day. Therefore, there can
be no kings, no class of social parasites who grow fat on food seized from others. Only in a 
farming population could a healthy, non-producing A©lite set itself above the disease-ridden 
masses. Skeletons from Greek tombs at Mycenae c. 1500 B. C. suggest that royals enjoyed a better 
diet than commoners, since the royal
skeletons were two or three inches taller and had better teeth (on the average, one instead of six 
cavities or missing teeth)a€!

Before the invention of agriculture you can use your status to pick the best of things, but the 
amount of things you have is limited to what you can personally carry. And if your exactions become 
too onerous the people can simply leave for the hills. But once a population becomes agricultural, 
people cannot leave for the hills. Agriculture opens a new
career path: that of a specialist in systematic violence directed against other humans who makes 
threats to induce them to give you a third of their cropa€”or else.

A parasitic caste or class existing by virtue of their organized ability to take a substantial 
share of the agricultural (and craftwork) producersa€™ crops becomes the rule soon after the coming 
of agriculture. Such castes and classes five better albeit more dangerously than the peasants. (If 
they didna€™t live better, after all, why accept the extra danger?)

A parasitic caste or class existing by virtue of their organized ability to threaten violence and 
then take a substantial share of the agricultural (and craftwork) producersa€™ crops becomes the 
rule soon after the coming of agriculture. Such castes and classes live better albeit more 
dangerously than the peasants. (If they didna€™ t five better, after all,
why accept the extra danger?) They live more dangerously because, after all, if they do not their 
numbers grow until they, once again, are at the Malthusian margina€”and what good is being a noble 
if you have to live like a peasant? Whatever social system they evolve will break down unless it 
(a) keeps their numbers low enough to maintain an edge
in standard-of-living, (b) keeps their lifestyle focused enough that they maintain their edge in 
violence, (c) keeps their numbers high enough that with their edge in violence they can maintain 
control, (d) keeps their numbers and their skill high enough to avoid being conquered by 
neighboring similar groups of thugs-with-spears, and (e) keeps their
exactions low enough that they are not destroyed by revolting peasants with nothing to lose anyway. 
Upper-class social systems that accomplish those five goals tend to be terrifyingly stable in human 
history since the invention of agriculture. And whenever such a system does collapse another 
replacement almost invariably soon grows up in its place.

Understanding Growth in the Shadow of Malthus

We see the effects of technological progress over the millennia before 1870 in the numbers of 
humanity as a whole, but also in the standard of living of the upper classes. To be a slave of 
Marcus Tullius Cicero in 76 BC was probably a lot like being a slave of Thomas Jefferson in 1776. 
The heavy plow and the horse collar allowed Monticello to feed a
greater population density than Tusculum. But Jefferson's life was not all that much like Cicero's. 
1800 years of technological progress largely tuned to elite consumption made themselves felt: 
bigger and better horses, carriages with springs, more interesting intoxicants, superior furniture, 
better heating technologies, superior artificial lighting systems,
et cetera. The only edge I can see is that Cicero had access to superior Roman bathing technologies 
that had been lost in the Dark Ages. And I see two overwhelmingly important differences for those 
in the Age of Jefferson: printing (and the fact that Jefferson had an extra 1800 years' worth of 
people to read who had joined the human conversation), and
coffee.

How important were these exceptions? How much should we value the fact that Thomas Jefferson lived 
better than Marcus Tullius Cicero given that their slaves lived about equally well? It probably 
dependsa€”a lota€”on whether you identify yourself with Jefferson and Cicero on the one hand or 
with their slaves on the other. And how much should
we value sheer numbersa€”the fact that the human population early in the nineteenth century was 
probably some five times or so its -70 level? (That is an unresolved issue in utilitarian 
philosophy.)

Aristotle was one of those who had no doubt that it was the heights achieved by humanity rather 
than the average that mattered, and that steep inequality was both inevitable and desirable. After 
all it was, Aristotle wrote, impossible to have a society in which there were people with the 
leisure and education to love wisdom without also having many
slaves. And that would be true unless we magically had instruments like a€oethe statues of 
Daedalus, or the tripods of HephaestusaCD such that a€oethe shuttle would weave and the plectrum 
touch the lyre without a hand to guide them.a€D Then a€oechief workmen would not want servants, nor 
masters slaves.a€D We today are in the utopian case
that Aristotle dismissed. But back in 1870 the world was not. It was that eraa€”the poor, 
Malthusian eraa€”that was what began to come to an end in 1870. But in 1870 it is going strong.

of reproduction^’’either because the benefits were confined to the (numerically small) upper 
classes or because the changes came accompanied by social
changes that increased mortality. Of course, social changes that increase mortality are hardly 
improvements in quality of life, are they?

Exceptions: Eras, Customs, and Classes

Now there were exceptions: exceptional eras, exceptional customs, and exceptional groups.

Exceptional eras come in two flavors. First, there are the years, the decades, and the centuries 
after key improvements in agriculture. The iron axe that allows for the clearing of temperate 
woodlands, the heavy plow that allows successful growth of grains in otherwise clayey wet soils, 
strains of wet rice that allow two or three crops of rice a yeara€”if
you first invest in the public works needed to flood the rice paddiesa€”the caravel and the 
settlement of North America all produce times in which life for the average rural peasant, and thus 
for the average urban laborer as well, was relatively good. Second, there are the years after 
Azrael in the form of the Bubonic Plague or something similar has
visited a region, the years in which populations are much smaller than they used to, farm sizes 
much larger, living standards highera€”and populations growing to make average farm sizes lower 
once again.

Exceptional customs are social arrangements that constrain human fertility and as a result keep 
populations from growing even when people are relatively well-fed and well-nourished. The most 
obvious is the European marriage pattern: the postponement of the median age of marriage for young 
women until their early or mid twenties, because fathers
demanded that potential husbands have prospectsa€’’ownership of a farm, a workshop, a profession, a 
competence^’’before they would let their daughters out of the household. Remember Romeo and Juliet! 
Remember the exchange between Old Capulet and Count Paris at the start of Act 1, Scene 2:

CAPULET: But saying o'er what I have said before:

My child is yet a stranger in the world;

She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

PARIS: Younger than she are happy mothers made.

CAPULET: And too soon marred are those so early made.
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,

She is the hopeful lady of my earth:

But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a parta€!

Lady Capulet has different ideas. And so, soon thereafter in Shakespearea€™ s play, does Juliet. 
But the drag exercised on female age of marriage by powerful patriarchal fathers who think they 
know better than their daughters what is good for them was (a) a social force making for older ages 
at marriage, (b) fewer pregnancies at a given state of
nutrition and real income, (c) as a result a somewhat richer society, (d) much heartbreak among the 
young, and (e) most of great European literature and tragedy.

In Asia, you have a similar institution with the lineage family. If in Europe it was the father 
telling the suitor that a€oeyou cannot marry my daughter until you can support her in the style I 
want her to be accustomed to,a€D in Asia it was the older brother and lineage head telling his 
brothers, sons, and nephews that a€oeyou cannot bring a wife into this
house until we have more resources .a€D

And, worldwide, there was the exposure of daughters unwanted by their father.

Exceptional groups are the upper and to a lesser extent the middle classesa€”and there are usually 
some upper classes since the invention of agriculture. As Jared Diamond points out, such privileged 
classes require agriculture:

Besides malnutrition, starvation, and epidemic diseases, farming helped bring another curse upon 
humanity: deep class divisions. Hunter-gatherers have little or no stored food, and no concentrated 
food sources, like an orchard or a herd of cows: they live off the wild plants and animals they 
obtain each day. Therefore, there can
be no kings, no class of social parasites who grow fat on food seized from others. Only in a 
farming population could a healthy, non-producing A©lite set itself above the disease-ridden 
masses. Skeletons from Greek tombs at Mycenae c. 1500 B. C. suggest that royals enjoyed a better 
diet than commoners, since the royal
skeletons were two or three inches taller and had better teeth (on the average, one instead of six 
cavities or missing teeth)a€!

Before the invention of agriculture you can use your status to pick the best of things, but the 
amount of things you have is limited to what you can personally carry. And if your exactions become 
too onerous the people can simply leave for the hills. But once a population becomes agricultural, 
people cannot leave for the hills. Agriculture opens a new
career path: that of a specialist in systematic violence directed against other humans who makes 
threats to induce them to give you a third of their cropa€”or else.

A parasitic caste or class existing by virtue of their organized ability to take a substantial 
share of the agricultural (and craftwork) producersa€™ crops becomes the rule soon after the coming 
of agriculture. Such castes and classes five better albeit more dangerously than the peasants. (If 
they didna€™t live better, after all, why accept the extra danger?)

A parasitic caste or class existing by virtue of their organized ability to threaten violence and 
then take a substantial share of the agricultural (and craftwork) producersa€™ crops becomes the 
rule soon after the coming of agriculture. Such castes and classes live better albeit more 
dangerously than the peasants. (If they didna€™ t five better, after all,
why accept the extra danger?) They live more dangerously because, after all, if they do not their 
numbers grow until they, once again, are at the Malthusian margina€”and what good is being a noble 
if you have to live like a peasant? Whatever social system they evolve will break down unless it 
(a) keeps their numbers low enough to maintain an edge
in standard-of-living, (b) keeps their lifestyle focused enough that they maintain their edge in 
violence, (c) keeps their numbers high enough that with their edge in violence they can maintain 
control, (d) keeps their numbers and their skill high enough to avoid being conquered by 
neighboring similar groups of thugs-with-spears, and (e) keeps their
exactions low enough that they are not destroyed by revolting peasants with nothing to lose anyway. 
Upper-class social systems that accomplish those five goals tend to be terrifyingly stable in human 
history since the invention of agriculture. And whenever such a system does collapse another 
replacement almost invariably soon grows up in its place.

Understanding Growth in the Shadow of Malthus

We see the effects of technological progress over the millennia before 1870 in the numbers of 
humanity as a whole, but also in the standard of living of the upper classes. To be a slave of 
Marcus Tullius Cicero in 76 BC was probably a lot like being a slave of Thomas Jefferson in 1776. 
The heavy plow and the horse collar allowed Monticello to feed a
greater population density than Tusculum. But Jefferson's life was not all that much like Cicero's. 
1800 years of technological progress largely tuned to elite consumption made themselves felt: 
bigger and better horses, carriages with springs, more interesting intoxicants, superior furniture, 
better heating technologies, superior artificial lighting systems,
et cetera. The only edge I can see is that Cicero had access to superior Roman bathing technologies 
that had been lost in the Dark Ages. And I see two overwhelmingly important differences for those 
in the Age of Jefferson: printing (and the fact that Jefferson had an extra 1800 years' worth of 
people to read who had joined the human conversation), and
coffee.

How important were these exceptions? How much should we value the fact that Thomas Jefferson lived 
better than Marcus Tullius Cicero given that their slaves lived about equally well? It probably 
dependsa€”a lota€”on whether you identify yourself with Jefferson and Cicero on the one hand or 
with their slaves on the other. And how much should
we value sheer numbersa€”the fact that the human population early in the nineteenth century was 
probably some five times or so its -70 level? (That is an unresolved issue in utilitarian 
philosophy.)

Aristotle was one of those who had no doubt that it was the heights achieved by humanity rather 
than the average that mattered, and that steep inequality was both inevitable and desirable. After 
all it was, Aristotle wrote, impossible to have a society in which there were people with the 
leisure and education to love wisdom without also having many
slaves. And that would be true unless we magically had instruments like a€oethe statues of 
Daedalus, or the tripods of HephaestusaCD such that a€oethe shuttle would weave and the plectrum 
touch the lyre without a hand to guide them.a€D Then a€oechief workmen would not want servants, nor 
masters slaves.a€D We today are in the utopian case
that Aristotle dismissed. But back in 1870 the world was not. It was that eraa€”the poor, 
Malthusian eraa€”that was what began to come to an end in 1870. But in 1870 it is going strong.
