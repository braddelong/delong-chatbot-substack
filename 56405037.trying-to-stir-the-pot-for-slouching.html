May I please order up a strongly critical review of <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em> &lt;<a href="https://t.co/bRKJD7ruJy">https://bit.ly/3pP3Krk</a>&gt; from you for publication in <em>Jacobin </em>in September?</p><p><strong>Zachary D. Carter</strong>: Unfortunately, Brad, I like it very much, and am writing it for <em>Dissent</em>.</p><p><strong>Brad DeLong</strong>: Come on! It has an overly-simplistic stripped-down pseudo-Polanyiesque Grand Narrative at its heart. That may have been adequate for a 1940s understanding of the dynamic of fascism, really-existing socialism, and classical (or, rather, pseudo-classical semi-liberalism then, but it is wholly inadequate for grasping the political-economy dilemmas of the world today!</p><p><strong>Zachary D. Carter</strong>: Starting to see why it took you so long to write…</p><p><strong>Brad DeLong</strong>: At the very least, a satisfactory book would deal:</p><ul><li><p>(a) with the role played by the fiduciary institution of modern science (a la Michael Polanyi) and the failed attempts to extend it into technocracy;</p></li><li><p> (b) with the fine-grained advance of technology (a la David Landes); </p></li><li><p>(c) with the interaction of technology and the creation of businesses and industries (and destruction of same) (a la Joseph Schumpeter); </p></li><li><p>(d) with the construction of institutions that were more truly liberal and democratic as attempts to approximate what an open society (a la Popper’s hopes) might be;</p></li><li><p>(e) with <em><strong>managerialism</strong></em> (a la Peter Drucker but also Alasdair MacIntyre) as an attempt to reconcile individual freedom with community purpose; </p></li><li><p>(f) with taming the market via wealth equalization and public provision (a la William Beveridge); </p></li><li><p>(g) with Coasian hopes to make the market sovereign and beneficent by carving property rights at the joints; </p></li><li><p>(h) with Pigovian realities that made that impossible; and </p></li><li><p>(i) with a much deeper dive at the failure of social democracy (under the trinity of Keynesian full employment and rentier-euthanasia, Pigovian externality correction, and Beveridgean redistribution) to pass its own sustainability test under pressure from the neoliberal challenge; and also </p></li><li><p>(j) with a much deeper dive into the extraordinary persistence of neoliberalism in spite of its failure to keep any of its promises about how it was going to promote the public good. </p></li></ul><p>The “what is to be done?” message of the book is, to the extent that there is one, “double-down on social democracy”. But that did not work in the 1970s, is unlikely to work now, and yet the book cannot suggest a better path because of its inadequate pseudo-Polanyiesque Grand Narrative frame.</p><p><strong>Vincent Palumbo</strong>: This imagined critical review makes me curious about contents of the book… I don’t usually preorder, but I might for this. Tons of long history books coming my way this summer &amp; fall. Finished one: Rise &amp; Fall of Neoliberal Order, which supplements tech aspect highlighted here…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/zachdcarter/status/1526986211667152898&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;<span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@delong</span> starting to see why it took you so long to write&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;zachdcarter&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Zachary D.

I am arrogant enough to know that the book is very good indeed. But the only way I am going to learn more quickly is to engage with smarter people who think that the book is fundamentally flawed. And the only way that the book will actually have an impact, and matter, is it for those who do not agree with the main thrust of it read it and consider it. If they do not do that, it might as well not have been written cola it will be as if it were balefired out of the Pattern.</p><p>And I am willing to listen. So, please, critics: tell me where the book is wrong…</p><p class="button-wrapper"

Basically, where you do not have a functioning banking or payments system, Tether—at least until it collapses because it is not properly collateralized—can substitute. You can send electronic messages. You can be reasonably confident that you will get the money to where it is supposed to go. And the frictions, while large compared to what we are used to, are small compared to what goes on in Ukraine.</p><p>But there is the big underlying problem with Tether: the potential profits to those who run the system come not from enabling cheap electronic dollar-denominated transactions using a stable electronic asset; the potential profits come from issuing Tether, and then taking the money paid and using it not for collateral and backing but for themselves…</p><div><hr></div><h2>Paragraphs:</h2><p>Natural gas you cannot do much with. Yes, it is only about half as bad for global warming as is oil or coal, but already, I think, we are burning more natural gas for energy than we can afford. But the truly insane thing is burning the more complicated hydrocarbon chains. Complex organic molecules are relatively rare and valuable things. They should be feedstocks. They should not be burned up for energy:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Doomberg</strong>: <em>Where Stuff Comes From</em>: ‘Take polyethylene, which is the highest volume production plastic in the world. To say polyethylene is ubiquitous is an understatement. Milk jugs, garbage bags, food packaging, wire and cable applications, pipes—polyethylene is everywhere. Industrially, polyethylene is made by sliding down the ladder: ethane is converted to ethylene, which is then polymerized. Ethane is close to natural gas on our [energy] ladder, while polyethylene has virtually the same inherent energy as oil.

Trump could have won re-election by backing sensible advice to contain the pandemic and agreeing to a stimulus that would have put more money in voters’ pockets. He might well be president now if he had listened to people around him.&nbsp;Trump had become a prisoner of the Kraken that he unleashed, however. That meant disdaining masks, rubbishing the medical establishment and refusing to take calls from Democrats offering him money on a platter. Now he is the one following the base more than the other way round. At a rally last December, Trump sang the praises of the Covid vaccine only to be shouted down by his own crowd. He has since kept silent on the vaccine, which was arguably his administration’s biggest feat…. [But] Trumpism cannot be uninvented. Democrats should not be consoled. The spirit that carried Trump to the White House is far more dominant among Republicans today than it was in 2016. Trump may care for little more than his drive to rewrite America’s election rules.

Yes, the British economy moved heaven and earth in the industrial revolution era to expand the labor force, and pulled in many new workers who were cheaper than prime-age males. But that is not a sign that labor was not scarce and expensive. It is a sign that it was. Yes, engineers and technicians are key. But they were part of the potential supply of resources for industrialization. You also needed a demand for industrialization, and that is what I think Allen has nailed:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Davis Kedrosky</strong>: <em>The Last Crusade</em>: ‘What caused the Industrial Revolution?…. Morgan Kelly, Joel Mokyr, and Cormac O’Grada, “The Mechanics of the Industrial Revolution”… that artisanal skill explains why Britain invented and adopted mechanized technology during the late eighteenth century. Simply put, Britain had a larger pre-existing stock of workers with enough mechanical proficiency to implement the designs of inventors and maintain and refine the machines. France, which had plenty of inventors but fewer engineers, was forced to import them from Britain…. No matter how good you are at inventing things, prototypes don’t get turned into productivity unless you can make machines that work….I think that this paper, while not quite getting at the biggest “why” question about the Industrial Revolution’s origins, offers a pretty compelling explanation of how the process actually happened…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:55848358,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://daviskedrosky.substack.com/p/the-last-crusade&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:29892,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Economic History Research&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5f6e817c-2c6f-4455-b329-08b210ed66fe_1064x1064.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Last Crusade&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;What caused the Industrial Revolution?

Immediate accession of Ukraine to the European Union into NATO, plus a Marshall Plan, plus NATO “training” brigades nearby Kharkiv, Kyiv, Dnipro, and Odesa. That is, I think, the best deal that could be done right now. And every single Russian power broker should be pressing Putin to do it, and we should be pressing Zelenskyy to do it. Yes, it is a second Yalta. Yes, it is a betrayal.

Running out of ways to de-escalate while saving face, he appears to think that he has no choice but to escalate.

Granted, recessions are difficult to predict, but I don’t think a recession is imminent. In my opinion, that’s still more of a 2023–2024 story, assuming the Fed can’t execute the soft landing. For now, the story remains one of deceleration…. The near-term path for rates remains unchanged. Fed speakers consistently endorse the consensus view of 50bp rate hikes at the June and July FOMC meetings. The September meeting is a potential opportunity to transition back to 25bp rate hikes if the data allows. If the Fed can’t find sufficient cover in the data to see a path back to 2% inflation within the forecast horizon, it will press forward with another 50bp…. Although the Fed will keep raising policy rates, we may already be at what is at least an effective pause in the tightening cycle. Fed speakers point to the two-year Treasury rate as the correct measure of the Fed’s policy stance, and that rate has plateaued in the last few weeks…. Forward guidance has already effectively pulled forward much of the policy tightening this cycle. Another illustration of this dynamic is the sharp divergence in the steepening between three-month and ten-year rates versus the flattening of the 2s10s spread…</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>There are people who think the peasants were happy, and that it was <em><strong>industrialization</strong></em> that produced the Dickensian landscape.
