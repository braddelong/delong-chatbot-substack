Slouching towards utopia? If utopia were on the cards, would slouching really be our problem? The big worry right now is the fear that the 20th century has set us hurtling towards collective disaster. Believers in technology insist that such pessimism is overdone. But nowadays they do at least feel the need to make the case, to demonstrate that to avoid disaster DeLong’s 20th-century formula—labs, corporations, markets and wise government—will suffice. Serenely untroubled by such concerns, <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em> reads less like a history than a richly decked out time capsule, a nostalgic throwback to the 20th century as we imagined it before the great anxiety began.</p></blockquote><p>1/ You might ask W.B. Yeats the same thing: “If the Second Coming were to be at hand, would <em><strong>slouching</strong></em> really be our problem?” </p><p>Here is Yeats’s poem, <em>The Second Coming </em> &lt;<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming">https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming</a>&gt;:</p><div class="preformatted-block"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false"></label><pre class="text">Turning and turning in the widening gyre   
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst   
Are full of passionate intensity.

Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.   
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out   
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert   
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,   
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   
The darkness drops again; but now I know   
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</pre></div><p>Yes: “slouching” is indeed our problem, in that we have enormous technological powers to create wealth—manipulation of nature and productive organization of humans—that could be used for human betterment and flourishing. Instead, we have a world in which killer robots stalk the skies above Syria and Ukraine, some of our most intelligent choose careers in which they work as hard as they can to terrify old people to glue their eyeballs to screens so they can be sold ads for fake diabetes cures, and the monsoon this year is 200 miles south of where it ought and needs to be.</p><p>We have figured out how to bake a sufficiently large economic pie so that, potentially, everybody could have <em><strong>enough</strong></em>. But the problems of slicing and tasting the pie—surely second-order problems after baking?—continue to flummox us more-or-less completely. We are inept at equitably distributing our wealth, and at using our wealth to advance the safety, security, happiness, and in some cases even the health of the human race.</p><p>Such hideous waste could perhaps have been expected back in 1914-1918, when the Age of Modern Economic Growth was less than two generations ago, and society was still marked by the long age in which the motor of history had been the need, since there could not be enough, for an élite to elbow competitors out of its way and run a force-and-fraud game on humanity. Back then we could understand how, in Winston Churchill’s words:</p><blockquote><p>The Great War… differed… in the immense power of the combatants… their fearful agencies of destruction… the utter ruthlessness with which it was fought. All the horrors of all the ages were brought together, and not only armies but whole populations were thrust into the midst of them…. Every outrage… was repaid by reprisals often on a greater scale and of longer duration…. Every effort was made to starve whole nations into submission without regard to age or sex. Cities and monuments were smashed by artillery. Bombs from the air were cast down indiscriminately. Poison gas in many forms stifled or seared the soldiers. Liquid fire was projected upon their bodies. Men fell from the air in flames, or were smothered, often slowly, in the dark recesses of the sea…. Torture and Cannibalism were the only two expedients that the civilized, scientific, Christian States had been able to deny themselves: and these were of doubtful utility…</p></blockquote><p>But now? We have had a hundred years—four generations—to grow up. And yet we have not.</p><div><hr></div><p>2/ Indeed, the point of the book is that DeLong’s 20th-century formula—labs, corporations, markets and wise government—suffices only for the baking of a sufficiently large economic pie, not for the slicing and tasting of it. </p><p>For governments are not wise. </p><p>And while the market may bear some resemblance to the Storm God of the Semites, we remain too stiff-necked a people to accept, in place of a real utopia, the red-lentil stews that if offers us.</p>
