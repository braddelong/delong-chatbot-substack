CONDITION: Fed Overreacting Watch

Ms. Market thinks the Fed has overdone it, and will be cutting, and trying to find the nerve to cut 
more, after February 2023.

Note that it is not Democrats who are making these financial market bets. This is what Republicans 
with money who are placing it on the line are thinking:

•  Bryce Elder: A Fed Funds Rate Dislocation'. a€~Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reida€l. investors 
are buying into the short-sharp-shock thesis. Futures are pricing in that US interest rates will 
peak at 3.39 percent at the February 2023 FOMC meeting, then come back by 0.7 percentage points 
over the following 12 monthsa€l <https://www.ft.com/content/29b568b6-83c5-4c52-a288-78894448386c>

• Paul Krugman: Taking the a€~Flationa€™ Out of Stagflation: a€~Powell acknowledged that this was a 
preliminary number that might be revised. Sure enough, the number was revised downa€!. The big 
story right now seems to be a quite sharp decline in market expectations of inflation over the

FIRST: The Speed of Transformation Post-1870, & Its Consequences:

Which of the ancien rAOgimes with capitals in Europe managed to avoid revolution and civil war in 
the transition to a€oemodernitya€n? 1848 saw only Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Holland, and Great 
Britain see little unrest. Piedmonta€”the Kingdom of Sardiniaa€’’avoided domestic insurrection by 
having its ancient rAOgime put itself at the head of the Italian nationalist movement. The Russian 
Empire escaped radical or nationalist revolution in 1848a€”
Poland had already tried to rebel in 1830. But that there would be a Russian Revolution of some 
forma€”more than a series of demonstrations followed by reform or by a coupa€”seemed very much in 
the cards. Nobody with a capital outside Europea€™ s far northwest corner seemed likely to escape.

Why? Because even in 1848 the underlying pace of socio-economic change was too great for an ancien 
rA©gime to maintain its precarious perch. And the pace of global socio-economic changea€”in the 
average global technological underpinnings of societya€”was going to be amped-up by a factor of 4.5 
as the world moved from the already extraordinary Industrial Revolution century of 1770-1870 to the 
post-1870 Modern Economic Growth era. Leta€™ s
give the mic to the very sharp Dominic Lieven:

Dominic Lieven: The End of Tsarist Russia: The March to World War I & Revolution: a€~Although the 
Russian case is unique, in this respect too international comparisons are nevertheless very 
important. In the two generations before 1914, European society as a whole had been transformed 
more fundamentally than in centuries of earlier history. It was hard for anyone to keep his balance 
amid dramatic economic, social, and cultural
change; predictions as to where change might lead in the future could inspire even greater 
giddinessa€!

Thus the post-1500 political-socio-economic history of the long 20th century was indeed, as Eric 
Hobsbawm says of his short 1914-1991 century, the history of an Age of Extremes. But the sheer 
magnitude of the wealth generated by technology those extremes more extreme on the high than on the 
low side: much more marvelous than terrible. But the terrible parts were very terrible indeed.

But why did it have to be terrible at all? Why couldna€™ t increasing wealth simply be 
semi-equitably distributed, and social and political systems adapt peacefully and gradually to 
underlying changing patterns of production and exchange and the relationships of social power that 
those patterns produced? Before 1870 the economy was changing only slowly, too slowly for people's 
lives at the end of a century to be that materiallydifferent fromhowthey had
been at the beginning. The economy was thus the painted-scene backdrop behind the stage, rather 
than the action on the stage.

From 1770-1870 there did indeed come an Industrial Revolution. But at its end, in 1870, in every 
country the bulk of people were still peasants, craftsmen, and servants working much as their 
ancestors a century before had donea€”even though the railroad, the steamship, the telegraph, the 
automated factory, the furnace, and the steam engine dominated the wealth-creation process. You 
could hang on.

British politics and governance in 1870 was different from how it had been in 1770, but not as 
different as the British economy was. French politics and governance had been utterly transformed. 
But for the other great powersa€”for their heads Regent Francisco Serrano DomAnguez Cuenca y PA©rez 
de Vargas, King Vittorio Emanuele Maria Alberto Eugenio Ferdinando Tommaso di Savoia, Emperor Franz 
Joseph Karl von Habsburg, EmperorWilhelm
Friedrich Ludwig von Hohenzollern, Sultan AbdAmaziz of the House of Osman, and Czar AleksAjndr II 
NikolAjyevich Romanov, and for all their ministers, industrialization and its consequences were one 
of the major factors they had to deal with, but not major enough to totally transform how they 
tried to rule.

Then in 1870 we got the final institutional pieces needed to support global economic growth: the 
industrial research laboratory, the modern corporation, and full globalization. One gathered 
communities of engineering practice to supercharge economic growth. The other organized communities 
of competence to deploy the fruits of invention. With globalization, cheap ocean and rail transport 
that destroyed distance as a cost factor and allowed humans in
enormous numbers to seek better lives, along with communications links that allowed us to talk 
across the world in real time. The coming of all three of these more or less at once was a truly 
mighty change, rationalizing and routinizing the discovery and development and the development and 
deployment and not just the local but the global deployment and diffusion of technological 
advances.

To put it another way, the industrial research lab fused science to technological innovation and 
technology to enterprise: a scientist could science, an inventor could invent, and a technologist 
could technologize without one person having to be all threea€”plus financier, manager, chief 
pitchman, human resource department, and so forth. Division of labor. And the bureaucratic 
corporation allowed the visible hand of management to scale a successful workshop
and store nationwide, or worldwide. And then there was diffusion: what one bureaucratic corporation 
could do, another could duplicate. And duplicate worldwide, with globalization. Discovery, 
development, deployment, and diffusiona€”the rationalization and routinization of those are what 
more than quadrupled the proportional rate of technological progress in the years around 1870.

The coming of all these three more than quadrupled the pace at which humanitya€™ s technological 
empire was increasing. And that post-1870 step-up in the growth rate lasted. Thereafter it has 
been, for all politicians, hang on for dear lifea€”and desperately try to rebuild working 
institutions on the fly as the socio-economic underpinnings of society are revolutionized and then 
re-revolutionized every single generation.

Stepping back and looking at the big picture, the post-1870 acceleration in growth and the more 
than twenty-fold amplification of human technological prowess in the years since 180 is a REALLY 
BIG F—ING DEAL. Briefly and very very roughly, what twenty workers were needed to do in 1870 with 
their eyes, fingers, thighs, brains, mouths, and ears, 1 worker was able to do in 2010. To get an 
equivalent proportional jump in the other direction, you have to
go back from 1870 to the Bronze Agea€”to the year -2000 or so. We are, proportionately, as separate 
in technology from the railroad's Golden Spike and the first transoceanic cables of 1880 as those 
were from the earliest chariots and the sculptor of the dancing girl of Mohenjo-Daro:


Moreover, the overwhelming bulk of the potential benefits for humans from that twenty-fold -6000 to 
1870 upward creep of technological knowledge had been eaten up by growing resource scarcity: the 
land and other natural resources available to support 1 person in -6000 had to support 200 by 1870. 
Thus better technology did not lead to as much changes in the life of the average peasant, 
craftsman, or servant as one would think. And so the problems of and
techniques for ruling Russia faced by Czar AleksAjndr II NikolAjyevich Romanov in the year 1870 
still bore a family resemblance to those faced by Ensi Gilgamesh, son of Lugulbanda, in Uruk in the 
year -3000.

Few people know or consider the extent to which, back even in 1870, for the working classes of even 
the richest countries in the world, sheer calories were a considerable constraint on your daily 
activities. You could work and do stuff until you had drained your energy budget and so were tired. 
Then you more or less had to stop. That the work or other stuff you could do was tightly 
constrained because you simply could not afford the calories that you needed to
do ita€”that is not a thing in the global north today. Yet that was an important part of the 
experience of humanity back before 1870.

But thereafter much was different. As much economic change and creative destruction as had taken 
place over 1720-1870 took place every 33 years after 1870. And the pace of change over 1720-1870 
had already been more than fast enough to shake societies and polities to pieces. "All that is 
solid melts into air", Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx had written in 1848: all established 
hierarchies and orders are steamed away. But even they had no real idea what
was coming after 1870. For Freddie from Barmen and Charlie from Trier mistook dawn for high noon. 
Yes, the business classa€”the French term bourgeoisie was the word they ultimately settled on (they 
had, earlier, followed Heinrich Heine is using the unfortunate terms a€oeJews and the 
Jew-likea€n)a€”had done revolutionary things in the century before 1848. But polities and societies 
had, for the most part, creaked and groaned, but had not (yet) shattered.

The post-1870 faster-pace repeated economic creative destruction upended societies, and in addition 
to opportunities posed two problems for governments: How were they to deal with the "destructive" 
part of creative destruction as it upended the lives of their people? And how were they to deal 
with neighboring governments that decided to use enhanced technological powers for evil for 
destruction and oppression? At the sharp end, a government gone horribly
wrong was a genocide-scale problem for the people under its boot, and for the people who were that 
government's neighbors. And so the long 20th century saw the worst tyrannies ever.

I think the best way into understanding the problems thus created by economic creative-destruction 
at the post-1870 is the path blazed by Karl Polanyi, who denounced this technological-advance 
market-economic project, in which humanity is made rich as a byproduct of profit-motivated economic 
agents responding to the price signals sent by the rich as a:

stark utopiaa€! [that] could not exist for any length of time without annihilating the human and 
natural substance of societya€!. Society took measures to protect itself, but whatever measures it 
took impaired the self-regulation of the market, disorganized industrial life, and thus endangered 
society in yet another way. It was this dilemma which forced the development of the market system 
into a definite groove and finally disrupted the
social organization based upon ita€!

Think of it: Your community and its associated land-use and sociability patterns ("land"), your 
occupations and its remuneration on a scale appropriate to your status and to your desert resulting 
from your applying yourself ("labor"), and the very stability of and your ability to be paid for 
performing your job at all (a€oefinancea€n)a€”all of these melt into air if they do not satisfy 
some maximum-profitability-use-of-resources test (a€oefictitious
commoditiesa€n) imposed by some rootless cosmopolite thousands of miles away. Furthermore, it is a 
maximum-profitability test that is applied, not a societal-wellbeing test The (competitive, 
externality-free, in-equilbrium) market system definitely and certainly maximizes something. But 
what it maximizes is not any idea of the well-being of society, but rather the wealth-weighted 
satisfaction of the rich.

No:a€™ a€~The market giveth, the market taketh away; blessed be the name of the market' was not a 
stable principle around which a government could organize society and political economy. The only 
stable principle had to be some version of 'The market was made for man, not man for the market'.

So society responded: people believe that they have other rights rather than property rights (which 
are valuable only if your particular piece of property is useful for producing things for which the 
rich have a serious jones). And so they strove to organize society to vindicate those other 
Polanyian rights. And so society did so by attacking the market, and by attacking all of those it 
saw as its internal and external enemies that the global market system was
empowering to oppress them. And those enemies included their government, that was trying and 
failing to manage the process to everyonea€™ s satisfaction. Upheaval was inevitable. Revolution 
nearly so.

In addition, there was nationalism. For nationalism, let me give the mic to the very sharp Cosma 
Shalizi, channeling the even sharper Ernest Gellner:

Cosma Shalizi: Ernest Gellner, Nations & Nationalism'. a€~The inhabitants ofa€! a€ceAgrariaa€D were 
economically static and internally culturally diversea€!. Because industrial economies continually 
make and put into practice technical and organizational innovationsa€! their occupational 
structures change significantly in a generationa€!. No one can expect to follow in the family 
professional. Training must be much more
explicit, be couched in a far more universal idiom, and emphasize understanding and manipulating 
nearly context-free symbolsa€!. It must in short take on the characteristics formerly associated 
with the literate High Cultures of Agrariaa€!. States become the protectors of High Cultures, of 
a€ceidiomsa€D; nationalism is the demand that each state succor and contain one and only one 
nation, one idioma€!. Faced with a difference
between onea€™ s own idiom and that needed for success, people either acquire the latter, or see 
that their children do (assimilation); force their own idiom into prominence (successful 
nationalism); or fester....

To recap: industrialism demands a homogeneous High Culture; a homogeneous High Culture demands an 
educational system; an educational system demands a state which protects it; and the demand for 
such a state is nationalism. The theory is coherent, simple, widely applicable, convincing, and 
empirically testable (which tests, to all appearances, it passes).a€!.

It is hard to decide whether nationalists or anti-nationalists will find Nations and Nationalism 
more disturbing; rootless cosmopolitan though I am, it changed my mind on a great many subjects. 
This is already a rare enough achievement for a philosopher or social scientistsL Unfortunately for 
those of us not enamoured of nationalism, he wasna€™ t talking rubbish at alla€!

tions-and-nationalism/>

Thus it is very comprehensible the pseudo-classical semi-liberal order governments tried to build 
on the fly in the mid- and late-1800s, in what was retrospectively called the Belle A%opoque, fell 
apart into so many different catastrophes. Governments and A©lites failed to manage economic 
creative-destruction at the fever-heat pace at which it lurched forward after 1870, This 
failure-to-manage led to many, many societal reactions against the ongoing rush of
claims that all was OK, and turned Europe into a hellhole and an abattoir until 1945.

Yes, yes, yes. Ten thousand times yes’:

Michael Kimmelman: How Houston Moved 25,000 People From the Streets Into Homes of Their Own'. 
a€~Theya€™ ve gone all in on a€oehousing first,a€D a practice, supported by decades of research, 
that moves the most vulnerable people straight from the streets into apartments, not into shelters, 
and without first requiring them to wean themselves off drugs or complete a 12-step program or find 
God or a job. There are addiction
recovery and religious conversion programs that succeed in getting people off the street. But 
housing first involves a different logic: When youa€™ re drowning, it doesna€™ t help if your 
rescuer insists you learn to swim before returning you to shore. You can address your issues once 
youa€™ re on land. Or not. Either way, you join the wider population of people battling demons

Freddie from Barmen on the proper place of industrial policy. I do wonder what he would have done, 
and whether progress in neoclassical economic science would have been materially greater, had he 
been engaging with Walras, Jevons, and company rather than serving as the flame-keeper for the 
works of his old friend:

Friedrich Engels (1888): On the Question of Free Trade: a€~He gave me examples as to how much the 
Americans taxed themselves in order to enrich a few greedy ironmasters. a€oeWell,a€n I replied, "I 
think there is another side to the question. You know that in coal, waterpower, iron, and other 
ores, cheap food, homegrown cotton, and other raw materials, America has resources and advantages 
unequalled by any European country;
and that these resources cannot be fully developed except by America becoming a manufacturing 
country. You will admit, too, that nowadays a, great nation like the Americansa€™ cannot exist on 
agriculture alone; that would be tantamount to a condemnation to permanent barbarism and 
inferiority; no great nation can live, in our age, without manufactures of her own. Well, then, if 
America must become a manufacturing country, and if
she has every chance of not only succeeding but even outstripping her rivals, there are two ways 
open to her: either to carry on for, let us say, 50 years under Free Trade an extremely expensive 
competitive war against English manufactures that have got nearly a hundred years start; or else to 
shut out, by protective duties, English manufactures for, say, 25 years, with the almost absolute 
certainty that at the end of the 25 years she will be
able to hold her own in the open market of the world. Which of the two will be the cheapest and the 
shortest? That is the question. If you want to go from Glasgow to London, you take the 
parliamentary train at a penny a mile and travel at the rate of 12 miles an hour. But you do not; 
your time is too valuable, you take the express, pay twopence a mile and do 40 miles an hour. Very 
well, the Americans prefer to pay express fare and to go
express speed.a€D

Most Americans Are Doing Well. For Now.

The typical U.S, household earned more than ever as of Maya€”even after accounting for inflation. 
And their finances were secure, with consumer spending rising at a steady clip even as their saving 
rate remained elevated. This is being obscured by the misfortunes of Americaa€™ s investors, who 
are being hit by huge tax payments owed on capital gains from 2021, falling asset values so far 
this year, and ongoing weakness in cash distributions via interest and
dividendsa€!

Yes, yes, yes. Ten thousand times yes!:

Michael Kimmelman: How Houston Moved 25,000 People From the Streets Into Homes of Their Own: 
a€~Theya€™ ve gone all in on a€oehousing first ,a€D a practice, supported by decades of research, 
that moves the most vulnerable people straight from the streets into apartments, not into shelters, 
and without first requiring them to wean themselves off drugs or complete a 12-step program or find 
God or a job. There are addiction
recovery and religious conversion programs that succeed in getting people off the street. But 
housing first involves a different logic: When youa€™ re drowning, it doesna€™ t help if your 
rescuer insists you learn to swim before returning you to shore. You can address your issues once 
youa€™ re on land. Or not. Either way, you join the wider population of people battling demons 
behind closed doorsa€!

Truly nice to see Adam getting more public-intellectual mindshare:

Annie Lowrey: Adam Tooze, Crisis Historian, Has Some Bad News for Us: a€~War, raising the specter 
of nuclear conflict. Climate change, threatening famine, flood, and fire. Inflation, forcing 
central banks to crush consumer demand. The pandemic, closing factories and overloading 
hospitalsa€!. Not too long ago, Tooze was an obscure academic. Now hea€™ s among the   worlda€™ s 
most influential financial commentators, with loyal
readerships in Washington, London, Paris, and Brussels, as well as on Wall Streeta€! books, opinion 
pieces, and a podcast. But his greatest reach might come through his Substack newsletter, 
Chartbook, which comes across as a bloggy, ivory-tower version of the research notes that 
investment-bank analysts send to clientsa€!.

He writes for people who like reading material that a€oehits a bit heaviera€D: more technical than 
what you might read in the Financial Times, more intellectual than reports put out by Goldman 
Sachs. But ita€™ s revelatory for many, including young lefties (described memorably in New York 
magazine as a€oeTooze Boysa€D), denizens of #econtwitter, history buffs, and   money managers, 
manyof whom trade on the data he digs
upa€!. As Tooze sees it, the forces of central-bank tightening, war, inflation, and climate change 
are reinforcing one another. He is offering no reassurance about where that might heada€”only the 
hope that perhaps this poly crisis might be knowable to usa€!

Freddie from Barmen on the proper place of industrial policy. I do wonder what he would have done, 
and whether progress in neoclassical economic science would have been materially greater, had he 
been engaging with Walras, Jevons, and company rather than serving as the flame-keeper for the 
works of his old friend:

Friedrich Engels (1888): On the Question of Free Trade: a€~He gave me examples as to how much the 
Americans taxed themselves in order to enrich a few greedy ironmasters. a€oeWell,a€n I replied, "I 
think there is another side to the question. You know that in coal, waterpower, iron, and other 
ores, cheap food, homegrown cotton, and other raw materials, America has resources and advantages 
unequalled by any European country;
and that these resources cannot be fully developed except by America becoming a manufacturing 
country. You will admit, too, that nowadays a, great nation like the Americansa€™ cannot exist on 
agriculture alone; that would be tantamount to a condemnation to permanent barbarism and 
inferiority; no great nation can live, in our age, without manufactures of her own. Well, then, if 
America must become a manufacturing country, and if
she has every chance of not only succeeding but even outstripping her rivals, there are two ways 
open to her: either to carry on for, let us say, 50 years under Free Trade an extremely expensive 
competitive war against English manufactures that have got nearly a hundred years start; or else to 
shut out, by protective duties, English manufactures for, say, 25 years, with the almost absolute 
certainty that at the end of the 25 years she will be
able to hold her own in the open market of the world. Which of the two will be the cheapest and the 
shortest? That is the question. If you want to go from Glasgow to London, you take the 
parliamentary train at a penny a mile and travel at the rate of 12 miles an hour. But you do not; 
your time is too valuable, you take the express, pay twopence a mile and do 40 miles an hour. Very 
well, the Americans prefer to pay express fare and to go
express speed.a€D

Really, really important. And really, really depressing:
