Too many people have been disappointed that the book is actually not much about the industrial research lab and the modern corporation, but rather about the consequences of the changes and transformations they midwifed. (It is very much about globalization.):</p><blockquote><p>What I call the “long twentieth century” started with the watershed-boundary crossing events of around 1870—the triple emergence of globalization, the industrial research lab, and the modern corporation—which ushered in changes that began to pull the world out of the dire poverty that had been humanity’s lot for the previous ten thousand years. What I call the “long twentieth century” ended in 2010, with the world’s leading economic edge, the countries of the North Atlantic, still reeling from the Great Recession that had begun in 2008, and thereafter unable to resume economic growth at anything near the average pace that had been the rule since 1870. The years following 2010 were to bring large system-destabilizing waves of political and cultural anger from masses of citizens, all upset in different ways and for different reasons at the failure of the system of the twentieth century to work for them as they thought that it should.</p><p>In between 1870 and 2010, things were marvelous and terrible, but by the standards of all of the rest of human history much more marvelous than terrible.</p></blockquote><p>There we have my first claim about the history of the long 20th century: that, both compared to all past centuries and on an absolute scale, the history of the long 20th century was indeed, as Eric Hobsbawm says, the history of an <em>Age of Extremes</em>—but those extremes were much much much more marvelous than terrible. The arc of long 20th-century history was, by and large and broadly, with many hesitations, backward slippages, and complications, toward not justice but at least toward hope, hope for someday a truly human world.</p><blockquote><p>The one-hundred and forty years 1870-2010 of the long twentieth century were, I strongly believe, the most consequential years of all humanity’s centuries.</p></blockquote><p>Here is my second claim: that the long 20th century was the most consequential century in humanity’s history, ever. Why? Because back in 1870 humanity was still desperately poor. Now some of us are very rich—the upper-middle classes of the global north are rich beyond the most fabulous dreams of luxury dreamed by previous ages. And most of us are, by the standards of all previous centuries, very comfortable and long-lived indeed. And that all of us are not so is a great scandal.</p><blockquote><p>And it was the first century in which the most important historical thread was what anyone would call the economic one, for it was the century that saw us end our near-universal dire material poverty.</p></blockquote><p>Here is my third claim: That in the long 20th century, for the very first time in human history, the principal axis of history was economic—rather than cultural, ideological, religious, political, military-imperial, or what have you. Why was the long 20th century the first such century in which history was predominantly economic? Because before 1870 the economy was changing only slowly, too slowly for people's lives at the end of a century to be that materially different from how they had been at the beginning. So the economy was thus the painted-scene backdrop behind the stage, rather than the action on the stage. (Now do note that you can still say that the principal axis of any millennium's history is economic, for over millennia things do change.)</p><p>But back up: what I have said here simply establishes that the principal axis of the history of the long 20th century could have been economic—that the economy was changing and that enough economic damn things were happening one after the other to make it a player in history. But was it a lead actor? One of the major themes of my book is going to be: Yes, it was the lead actor.</p><blockquote><p>My strong belief that history should focus on the long twentieth century stands in contrast to what others—most notably the Marxist British historian Eric Hobsbawm—have focused on and called the ‘short twentieth century’, which lasted from the start of World War I in 1914 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p></blockquote><p>This is a minor digression: My Grand Narrative of the 20th century is not the only Grand Narrative one could construct. We have to have some Grand Narrative, some single most-important plot thread—if we don't, we almost cannot think at all, for we really have almost no way to think other than in narrative. I think mine is the most important. But others disagree. And it is important never to forget that every Grand Narrative allows and enables you to see some things—hopefully the most important things to you—very clearly indeed, but blocks your vision of other things.</p><blockquote><p>Such others tend to see the nineteenth century as the long rise of democracy and capitalism, from 1776 to 1914, and the short twentieth century as one in which really-existing socialism and fascism shake the world.</p></blockquote><p>In fact, I believe that, in the western academy, the predominant major Grand Narrative, at least implicitly, of the 20th century is that it was really-existing socialism vs. fascism, and really-existing socialism knocking itself out in the process of winning its victory, leaving consumer capitalism—“that old bitch gone in the teeth”, as the other great post-WWII British Marxist historian E.P. Thompson calls it &lt;<a href="https://t.co/oTWWRRPN75">https://marxists.org/archive/thompson-ep/1973/kolakowski.htm…</a>&gt;, as the unworthy victor in the struggle over systems of political-economic organization.</p><p>Needless to say, I do not take this view.</p><p>I see the three-part mid-century struggle between the systems as, not a sideshow, but as something taking place outside of the center ring.</p><blockquote><p>Histories of centuries, long or short, are by definition grand narrative histories, built to tell the author’s desired story.</p></blockquote><p>You cannot write a history of an entire century without committing yourself to <em>some</em> Grand Narrative—without a spearpoint you cannot conduct a successful hunt, and without a central thread for them to follow, humans, who think in narratives, cannot grasp and remember your story. Thus the necessity of the spearpoint. It will be imperfect and "false". But it is necessary and essential. You have to hold both the necessity and the imperfectness in your mind simultaneously, always, as you read and think. The map is not the territory. The map, however, is the map. Your history will then stand or fall based on how well you back that narrative.</p><blockquote><p>Setting these years, 1914–1991, apart as a century makes it easy for Hobsbawm to tell the story he wants to tell.</p></blockquote><p>Hobsbawm’s choice of period was calculated to provide heavy weight for the spearshaft behind the spearpoint of the particular Grand Narrative he wished to tell. Indeed, if you start and end on Hobsbawm’s dates—1917 and 1990—it is very hard not to wind up telling some version of his story. It may well not have the valence he gives it: of World Communism as the tragic and doomed hero of the century, defeating fascism but being so poisoned by the circumstances of its development and struggle that it then expires after a long decline, leaving its unworthy rival consumer capitalism in control, and thus closing off humanity's road to utopia. The 1917-1990 short 20th century can be told with Frank Fukuyama's "end of history" valence instead. But, as I said, while that is certainly <em>a</em> story, I do not think it is THE story that people 500 or 1000 years from now will .think is important and tell when they tell the story of the years on both sides of 1950.</p><blockquote><p>But it does so at the price of missing much of what I strongly believe is the bigger, more important story.</p></blockquote><p>I really don’t think either really-existing socialism or fascism is, in the long run of human destiny, worthy of being a protagonist (or an antagonist) in big-think broad-sweep history. I mean: really-existing socialism was a dead end, a false path, a horrible warning in terms of political-economic systems. And as for fascism... well... if it turns out that future historians want to tell political history not as a whig progressive but rather as an Aristotelian alternation-and-decay-and-replacement-of-régimes story, then fascism will have its place as a form of tyranny in the age of mass and social media, much as Thoukydides discusses the role of Peisistratos and his supposed championing of the cause of the <em>hyperakrioi</em>—with the exception that Peisistratos did actually have policies to boost the prosperity of the <em>hyperakrioi</em>, and did make Athens great. But if we do better than Aristotelian alternation in political régimes in the long run, fascism and its cousins will also be seen as dead ends, horrible warnings, stories that we tell to remind us how horrible people can be to one another, rather than the protagonist of some Grand Narrative principal thread of human history.</p><blockquote><p>The bigger, more important story is the one that runs from about 1870 to 2010, from humanity’s circa-1870 success in unlocking the gate that had kept it in dire poverty, up to its circa-2010 failure to maintain the pace of the rapid upward trajectory in human wealth that the earlier success had set in motion.</p></blockquote><p>I think that is the worthy story of the history of the 20th century has as its protagonist neither really-existing socialism, nor really the “free world” that triumphed over the totalitarianisms. I think that the worthy story is, rather, humanity’s escape from Malthusian poverty—and from societies in which the class of people with leisure to think deeply and nutrition to think about something other .than how hungry they are is small, and is composed of those who have figured out how to unproductively take an outsized share by force and fraud. This escape from the realm of material necessity into the realm of freedom, choice, and options is, I think, the proper story—and the big story. And its proper protagonist is humanity.</p><p>And if you haven’t bought the book, I have now gotten enough favorable feedback from non-friends to be able to very confidently say: you really should but it—and I am not just saying that because I am the author. &lt;<a href="http://bit.ly/3pP3Krk">bit.ly/3pP3Krk</a>&gt;.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>MUST-READ: <strong>The Entrepreneurial State:</strong></h2><p>No answers, but lots of good questions:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Caleb Whatney: </strong><a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2022/11/but-seriously-how-do-we-make-an-entrepreneurial-state/">But Seriously, How Do We Make an Entrepreneurial State?</a>: ‘<em>How to Make an Entrepreneurial State: Why Innovation Needs Bureaucracy<br></em>by Rainer Kattel, Wolfgang Drechsler, and Erkki Karo… Building on… Mariana Mazzucato... a fiery defense of the essential role the public sector will need to play in supporting innovation…. But without a clear plan for improving state capacity, such efforts often prove to be wasteful and ineffective.... <em>How to Make an Entrepreneurial State</em> gets mired in high-level abstractions and historical case studies, and ultimately neglects practical questions. A better title for the book might be “Why to Make an Entrepreneurial State”—the “How” is scarcely to be found…. Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the Swedish innovation agency Vinnova… certain themes… repeat… the need for flexible hiring rules, the importance of attracting a nation’s best and brightest into public service, and the significance of overarching “missions”....</p><p>So, how does one actually make an entrepreneurial state? There is no single correct model, and in fact, an essential element of entrepreneurship is the ability to correct course and revise plans in real time….

And by “experiment”… I mean the scientific sense of experiment… design, data collection, and evaluation…. One of the ongoing public reckonings relevant to the present discussion is why, exactly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) failed so extensively at controlling and preventing disease….

And that the “unequals” here are those who are perceived as not trying to hold up their end of the social contract. This remains an enormous problem—especially when a majority or a near-majority judges, that those whose skin is a different color or who speak with a different accent, or ipso facto, not holding up their end of the social contract:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam Freedman: </strong><a href="https://samf.substack.com/p/the-changing-politics-of-aspiration?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">The Changing Politics of Aspiration + Fairness</a>: ‘I’m interested in… particular changes in how voters see key concepts like “aspiration” and “fairness”. Back in the 90s it was a new approach to these ideas that underpinned the transformation of… Labou…. Phillip Gould… Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson… focus on the aspirational working and lower middle classes, a consequence of Gould’s own early life growing up in Woking. He was enormously frustrated by the inability of Labour in the 80s and early 90s to speak to these voters and their entirely reasonable desire for a better life, a higher wage, a new car, or a refitted kitchen. The Tories did seem able to offer this, whether by allowing people to own their council flat, offering shares in newly privatised companies that could be sold on for profit, or through tax cuts. All of this came at the price of higher inequality, which was why Labour fought it all so hard. But they discovered that seeking to defend the most vulnerable groups wasn’t enough, by itself, to win an election. </p><p>The left-wing conception of fairness as equality, Gould argued, simply didn’t fit with the electorate’s model: “The view was growing that those who worked hard and behaved responsibly were not being fairly rewarded, while others made gains they did not deserve, had not worked for, were not entitled to…. When people are asked what fairness means they invariably answer by one form or another of the same formulation: stop people abusing the system, give people who work hard a fair deal.”… Blair was the son of an aspirational Tory, for him it wasn’t just strategy or triangulation, it was an essential part of his political identity. For Starmer and most of the current shadow cabinet it feels a bit more strained because they were brought up believing more in the traditional Labour model of fairness…. In 1992 Gould, Blair and Brown tried to imbue Labour with a more aspirational message but Kinnock and Smith couldn’t make it stick, and never really got it, at least not in such a visceral way. Some commentators think the same could still happen to Starmer…</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Ah! Wow!

In Marlowe's Faust, Dr Faustus says, “Bid Onkaymeon [sp?] farewell”, referring the Greek “On kai me on”, meaning “being and not being”: the kind of thing that philosophers have worried over from the earliest times. An early edition (the first, I think) corrected this to the simple and understandable and wrong “Bid Economy farewell”. Or so I have read. I pondered this for a time till I realized that Economy here meant Frugality, to which Faustus could bid farewell now that he had Mephistopheles working for him.
