Why you should be happy about inflation and worried about something else, top economist Brad DeLong 
says

Inflation may have an upside.

How could high inflation possibly be good?

Not only are you paying more for stuff than a year ago, but the consistently higher-than-expected 
readings in the Consumer Price Index continue to devastate the stock market, sending the S&P 500 
down over 1,000 points on Tuesday, its worst day since June 2020.
One of Americaa€™ s top financial historians says this moment calls for a lesson in economics.

a€oeThe reopening inflation wea€™ ve had has so far been a very good thing,a€D Brad DeLong, a 
professor at UC Berkeley, told Fortune. His comments contradict the more hawkish stance on 
inflation famously championed by Harvard economist Larry Summers, who worked alongside DeLong in 
the Department of the Treasury during the Clinton administration.
DeLong argues that there is a major economic shift taking place that people should welcome. It all 
has to do with our strange but kind of wonderful post-pandemic economy.

The Zoom world

The new economy, DeLong says, is one with more time spent online, fewer jobs requiring in-person 
interactions, and a substantially higher rate of goods production.
Ita€™ s like we have zoomed decades into the future in just a few years.

a€oeA couple of decades ,a€D DeLong said when asked about how many years of economic change have 
been crunched into just over two: a€oeA couple of decades of structural change and social and 
economic learning about how to be online as a permanent thing.a€D

a€oeFewer in-person workers in retail establishments, a lot more delivery orders, substantially 
more goods production, and also substantially more information entertainment and production as 
well,a€D is how DeLong described his vision for the new economy during a separate interview with 
Fortune last week covering his new book, Slouching towards Utopia. The meeting took place over 
Zoom, DeLong noted, proving his point.
Inflation in the U.S. is currently serving two functions that could help the economy in the long 
run, according to DeLong: helping expand new economic sectors poised for big growth, and uncovering 
and optimizing supply chain snags that have been with us since the beginning of the pandemic.

Unemployment is now at its lowest point since before the pandemic, but the full employment we are 
returning to is not the same as the one we left behind in 2020, DeLong said.
a€oeWe want to get back to a full employment economy quickly. But ita€™ s a very different full 
employment economy when we get back there,a€D DeLong said.

Moving workers away from industries like retail and hospitality and into expanding sectors needs to 
come with incentives in the form of higher wages, according to DeLong, which means inflation.
a€oelf you want to create economic incentives for people to move into the expanding sectors where 
we actually need more workers, their wages have to go up,a€D he said.

a€oeWhen youa€™re coming out of a big recession, the natural rate of inflation has got to be above 
the normal 2%,a€D he added. a€oeThe rate of inflation that the market really wants to see in order 
to get production and distribution and transportation into an efficient allocation has to be more 
than 2%.a€D
In addition to helping bring the economy into the new era, DeLong sees another benefit of inflation 
today: it could help resolve crippling supply chain bottlenecks, resorting to the economic adage 
that high prices are often the best cure for high prices.

With supply chain issues contributing to high prices and making people less likely to buy, it could 
be the impetus behind a revitalization and ultimately a strengthening of industry, according to 
DeLong, who says inflation is involving more people with figuring out either how to produce more of 
what we need, or less of what we dona€™ t.
a€oeThat's the absolutely glorious thing about the market,a€D he said. a€oeThat when prices are 
aligned with social values, it means that you don't just have one brain or a few brains working on 
the problem. Everyone's brain is working on the problem. And everybody does what they can to solve 
it in their immediate circumstance.a€D
But as always, therea€™ s a catch.

Stagflation risks

The positive outlook for inflation does come with a caveat, DeLong and other economists admit. 
Expectations that inflation will become entrenched in the economy and stick around might become a 
self-fulfilling prophecy, which would lead to something even worse for the economy.
The word for that is stagflation: the worst-case scenario of slow economic growth combined with 
high inflation. DeLong says it is still very possible.

a€oeWorst of all is you get stuck in the stagflation of the 1970s,a€D he said. a€oelf inflation 
gets entrenched in expectations, it will be a very bad thing ,a€D

The ideal situation, DeLong says, would be a repeat of the recessions that hit the U.S. in the late 
1940s and early 1950s, both of which were relatively short before inflation subsided.
But a worst-case scenario of stagflation also remains possible, DeLong warned, especially if 
expectations of inflation become entrenched in the economy.

a€ceEntrencheda€D has been a bogey word for the Fed this year, and a situation it desperately wants 
to avoid. Entrenched inflation refers to people expecting prices to keep going up, which can lead 
to inflation staying around much longer than it would otherwise.

Should inflation become entrenched during a recession, it would be a a€oevery bad thinga€D for the 
economy, DeLong said. Whether this will happen will likely depend on the direction gasoline and 
energy prices take, which have been highly unpredictable so far this year.
a€oeWhether or not expectations get entrenched and we get a 1970s problem really depends on the 
trajectory of energy prices,a€D he said. a€oelnflation expectations are always driven by what 
people see at the pump.a€D

Top economists and bankersa€’’including Allianz and Gramercya€™ s chief economic adviser Mohamed 
El-Erian and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomona€”have warned that inflation is already becoming 
entrenched and persistent around the world. And theWorld Bank has issued multiple warningsthis year 
that persistent inflation combined with slow economic growth is leadingto a very real risk of 
stagflation in multiple countries around the world.
Also, not every economist shares DeLonga€™ s view that there is much good at all about the current 
inflation, with many saying it is a much more pressing issue that the government is failing to 
adequately control.

Steve Hanke, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, recently criticized the Fed for 
a€oeincompetence and mismanagement^ □ that has led to inflation, and predicted that the Fed letting 
the U.S. money supply run short could lead to a a€oewhoppera€□ of a recession next year.

DeLonga€™ s old boss Larry Summers has been singing a dire tune on inflation for over a year, 
warning last year that the Federal Reserve was being too passive about rising prices. At the 
release of this weeka€™ s CPI report, Summers wrote that the Fed was faced with a 
a€oeseriousinflation problem,a€D and cautioned that unemployment will likely have to start ticking 
upward before inflation recedessignificantly.
Many economists fear that todaya€™ s high levels of inflation, and the Feda€™ s commitment to 
containing it, could trigger a recession as early as next year, although the jury is still out on 
whether this would constitute a deep or shallow downturn.

In a blog post last year, when inflation was already becoming a source of concern, DeLong compared 
the recovering U.S. economy to a driver suddenly accelerating away. The skid marks left on the 
asphalt represented inflationa€”a blemish and a nuisance to be surea€”but worth it to get the 
economy back on track.
A year later, inflation can still just represent a temporary skidmark on the road to recovery, he 
says. But between the war in Ukraine and uncertain energy markets for the foreseeable future, 
DeLong admits the outlook is much cloudier now.

a€oeWe have energy price inflation and food price inflation springing from Russia and its attack on 
Ukraine. That is greatly complicating the picture and making the situation much more fraught,a€D he 
said.
