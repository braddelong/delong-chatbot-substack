First:

We economists observe the very broad sweeps of data generated by firms and governments accounting 
systems. They arise out of human propensity to cement social bonds and deepen our societal division 
of labor by entering into reciprocal gift-exchange relationships. We have both extraordinarily 
amplified yet also narrowly focused these by mediating them via through the social fiction of 
a€oemoneya€oe. Thus gift-exchange gets divided into one-shot cash-on-
the-barrelhead quantified discrete episodes. And from the counted-up totals and subtotals we 
economists can see, plus economistsa€™ present and past introspection into our motives and 
behavior, we then guess at what the cocial human reality is signalled by those particular patterns 
that our counts have told us are typical.

But there is a problem here. We count, and our counts tell us what interactions are typical and 
representative. But then we rely on introspection to help us turn our numbers into ideas of what 
these patterns really mean. That is not good enough. What we really, really need is for somebody 
who can dive deep into an individual case study a€’’someone very sensitive to human psychology, to 
how it signifies itself in human actions, and how human actions combine
with the actions of others to generate human group behavior. We need anthropologists.

Gillian Tett is an anthropologist. The fact that she is also perhaps the best financial and 
economic journalist of her generation tells us how desperately we need the types of insights 
anthropologist generate if we economists are to get even a small clue as to what the patterns in 
the numbers we have counted mean. And she has written a book, and throw vision, about what Modern 
economic life looks through an anthropologist. Buy it. Read it. I do not know of a
better way for you to spend some of your time in the next month:

Gillian Tett: Anthro-Vision: A New Way to See in Business & Life 
<https://www.google.com/books/edition/Anthro Vision/upOtEAAAQBAJ>
Here is a quote from Anthro-Vision:

Because a€cegiftsa€D are usually considered to be the mirror of marketa€”or commercials’’behavior, 
they tend to be excluded from economistsa€™ modelsa€L Anthropologists have always had a much 
broader vision of a€ceeconomicsa€Da€! study how exchanges bind societies together in the widest 
possible sensea€!. Mauss argued that gift-giving is endemic to societies around the world, and has 
three parts: an obligation to give,
to receive, and most crucially, to reciprocatea€! usually delayed, creating a social 
a€cedebta€na€!.a€ceGiftsa€D create trailing debts that bind people togethera€!. Just think of how 
the gigantic student loan industry in America, say, is embedded in family obligations and relations 
which cannot be captured just by a trillion-dollar numbera€! financial flows are about money but 
they also involve far more than finance, since they are
rooted in kinship structures and trailing patternsa€!. [Thus] talking about a€oebartera€n in the 
twenty-first century might not be as odd as it seemsa€!. Communities without money often have 
extensive and complex a€oecredita€D systems since households create social and economic debtsa€!. 
In Silicon Valley information is constantly being a€oegiven upa€D in exchange for the a€cegifta€D 
of free servicesa€!. Many of the
participants in this a€cebartera€D are not explicitly aware that they are involved in a barter at 
all. Howevera€! there is no other readily available word in Englisha€!

In Silicon Valley, the relationship created by these exchanges of information-commodities for 
information about customer psychology and attention patterns are never one-shot, and always have 
psychological valence. But this is also true in the world as a wholea€”even when it is strictly 
business, in inevitably becomes personal to some degree. Economists almost always think as if the 
degree it is a€cepersonala€D can be neglected, and perhaps that was true in
an environment in which the pressure of material necessity was immense. But perhaps not even then.

That is the first quote that struck me from Anthro-Vision.

I was, however, struck by another quotea€”one that made me think that even though we economists 
badly need anthropologists to help us do our job, we are going to be unable to get them from the 
discipline of anthropology as it is currently constructed here in the United States. Here is the 
second quote:
Kathi Kitner, another anthropologist at Intela€! [and] an academic she described with the pseudonym 
a€oeTripa€Da€! got talkinga€!. Tripa€! asked: a€~How do you continue as an anthropologist and work 
at a place like Intel?a€™ a€Sa€D Kitner later recalled:

I knew what she really meant. Dona€™ t they suck your soul out from within you? Dona€™ t you hate 
having to sell out peoplea€™ s lives for a corporate profit? What is it like to be working from the 
belly of a capitalistic beast? How can you work under such unethical conditions? Havena€™ t you 
sold out?

Kitner replied a€oeNo.a€n She believed that her work at Intel was valuable because she was helping 
engineers gain empathy for people different from them. Or as Bell explained: a€oeWhat we are trying 
to do is show people that tech is not just designed for and by a group of white men in their 
twenties in California.a€n However, unease continued to bubble among some academics. Even 
enthusiasts for business anthropology fretted
that their methods might become so diluted that they would be subsumed into activities like 
a€oeuser experiencea€D (known as USX or UX) research, human computer interaction (HCI), 
human-centered design, human factors engineering, and so ona€!

Almost surely a€oeTripa€™ has a laptop computer, which has at its core a microprocessor designed 
and manufactured by Intel or one of its very few competitor organizations. About $200 of the money 
that Trip paid to buy her (notional) laptop was then paid on to Intel for the microprocessor.

Taking sand, baking it into a rock, and then spraying chemicals onto it and then etching it with 
lasers so that when you pass electricity through it the electrons stand up and dance in such a way 
as to greatly assist you in your tasks of writing words, manipulating numbers, and drawing pictures 
is an incredibly technologically sophisticated and glorious thing. To do so requires a world-class 
organization of humans that reaches heights of competence and
knowledged’’embedded not just in the minds of its engineers and in its organizational 
structured’’that no single human would ever have a prayer of understanding even 1/100 of it if they 
spent their entire life on the task of learning just how one type of microprocessor is built. And 
all of this is done for dceTripd™ sdD great benefit: the use-value she gains from her 
microprocessor is vastly in excess of the exchange-value she pays for it, and that exchange­
value        is what then gives the engineers, the janitors, and, yes, the anthropologists employed 
by Intel the social power that allows the, you know, to get food.

To take this process and this organization and to describe it as dcesoul-suckingdD, doeselling-out, 
doebelly of a beast, doeunethical conditionsdnd”well, the first analogy that springs to my mind is 
that this is a moral fault of the same magnitude as condemning those who deal with human waste and 
its transformation into fertilizer and leather-curing chemicals as subhumans to be despised.

Moreover, dceTripd™ sdD attitude seems to be 100% opposed to that of a real anthropologist. To buy 
into a particular subset of mythic misperceptions about the world so completely that she sees Intel 
not as a major benefactor of her via gift-exchanged’’which it isd”but entirely as a caste-polluted 
monstrosity seems to show an extraordinary lack of judgment and a complete absence of an ability to 
engage in self-reflection. Bluntly: I would not trust
anything dceTripdD said about how any culture she was observing works, given that she has so very, 
very little insight into her own J

Yes. We economists badly and vitally need assistance from a very large body of well-trained 
ethnographers. But I do not think we are going to get them out of current anthropology Ph.D. 
programs.

Paragraphs:

Arthur Burns did have a theory of the interplay between the real economy and inflation: it was that 
inflation was a political problem, that had to be dealt with by legislationa€”that the Federal 
Reserve would be unable to deal with it via monetary policy because the U.S. Congress would not 
allow it to provoke a recession deep enough to do the job. Why not? Because labor unions knew the 
U.S. Congress would not allow a deep recession, and so a shallow
recession that they knew would soon be over would not do the job. I do not know why Roach does not 
know this:

Stephen S. Roach: The Ghost of Arthur Burns'. a€™ The US Federal Reserve is insisting that recent 
increases in the price of food, construction materials, used cars, personal health products, 
gasoline, and appliances reflect transitory factors that will quickly fade with post-pandemic 
normalization. But what if they are a harbinger, not a a€cenoisya€D deviation?a€! Arthur F. 
Burnsa€! brought a unique perspective to the US central bank
as an expert on the business cycle. In 1946, he co-authored the definitive treatise on the 
seemingly rhythmic ups and downs of the US economya€!. Yet Burns, who ruled the Fed with an iron 
fist, lacked an analytical framework to assess the interplay between the real economy and 
inflation, and how that relationship was connected to monetary policy. As a data junkie, he was 
prone to segment the problems he faced as a policymaker,
especially the emergence of what would soon become the Great Inflation. Like business cycles, he 
believed price trends were heavily influenced by idiosyncratic, or exogenous, 
factorsa€“a€cenoisea€D that had nothing to do with monetary policy. This was a blunder of epic 
proportionsa€!

Did this speech help induce Stalin to let slip the leash on Kim II Sung and the other dogs of the 
Korean War? We have no documentary evidence that it did. But it is hard to believe that the absence 
of Korea from the U.S. defense perimeter in 1950 did not play some sort of role:

Dean Acheson (1950): National Press Club Speech'. a€™ The disarmament of Japan has placed upon the 
United States the necessity of assuming the military defense of Japana€! in the interest of our 
security and in the interests of the security of the entire Pacific area and, in all honor, in the 
interest of Japanese securitya€!. This defensive perimeter runs along the Aleutians to Japan and 
then goes to the Ryukyus. We hold important
defense positions in the Ryukyu Islands, and those we will continue to hold. In the interest of the 
population of the Ryukyu Islands, we will at an appropriate time offer to hold these islands under 
trusteeship of the United Nations. But they are essential parts of the defensive perimeter of the 
Pacific, and they must and will be held. The defensive perimeter runs from Ryukyus to the 
Philippine Islands. Our relations, our defensive relations
with  the Philippines are contained in agreements between us. Those agreements are being loyally 
carried out and will be loyally carried out. Both peoples have learned by bitter experience the 
vital connections between our mutual defense requirements. So far as the military security of other 
areas in the Pacific is concerned, it must be clear that no person can guarantee these areas 
against military attack. But it must also be clear that such a
guarantee is hardly sensible or necessary within the realm of practical relationship. Should such 
an attack occur, one hesitates to say where such an armed attack could come from, the initial 
reliance must be on the people attacked to resist it and then upon the commitments of the entire 
civilized world under the Charter of the United Nations, which so far has not proved a weak reed to 
lean ona€!. A new daya€! has dawned in Asia. It is a
day   in which the Asian peoples are on their own, and know it, and intend to continue on their 
own. It is a day in which the old relationships between east and west are gone, relationships which 
at their worst were exploitation and at their best were paternalism. That relationship is over, and 
the relationship of east and west must now be in the Far East one of mutual respect and mutual 
helpfulnessa€!

Do note that it may not be feudal structure so much as that sultans controlled more civilized lands 
with greater trade, and so could tax the resources to maintain a professional army. For, after all, 
it did not have to be slaves. Once the kings of Spain had enough revenue flowing in from the West 
Indies, they, too, raised a professional army and so stopped listening to the notables and the 
legislative assemblies:

Christian West & the Muslim World before 1500 CE: a€~While leadership tenures in the two regions 
were similar in the 8th century, Christian kings became increasingly long lived compared to Muslim 
sultans. We argue that forms of executive constraint that emerged under feudal institutions in 
Western Europe were associated with
increased political stability and find empirical support for this argumenta€!. Feudal institutions 
served as the basis for military recruitment by European monarchs, Muslim sultans relied ona€! 
military slavesa€!. Dependence on mamluk armies limited the bargaining strength of local notables 
vis-a'-vis the sultan, hindering the development of a productively adversarial relationship between 
ruler and local elites. We argue that Muslim
societiesa€™ reliance on mamluks, rather than local elites, as the basis for military leadership, 
may explain why the Glorious Revolution occurred in England, not Egypta€!

I dona€™ t think that they have nailed it. But looking at the interactions is very important:
