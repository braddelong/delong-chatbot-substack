Bradford DeLong</strong> (Sep. 6, 2022): <em>Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Long 20th Century, 1870-2010</em> (New York: Basic Books, ) &lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economic-History-Twentieth-Century/dp/0465019595/">https://www.amazon.com/Economic-History-Twentieth-Century/dp/0465019595/</a>&gt;:</p><p><em>Slouching Towards Utopia </em>is a book in the same class as Jared Diamond's&nbsp;<em>Guns, Germs, &amp; Steel</em>&nbsp;or Thomas Piketty's&nbsp;<em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The theme of Diamond’s&nbsp;<em>Guns</em>—a brilliant book, if not without its major flaws (and what things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)—is: Civilizations in different places had access to different plant and animal resources, and for developing bio and other technologies two heads are better than one. Within Eurasia at the last the Atlantic Seaboard led in agricultural wealth and hence first developed the steel and the guns. Plus Eurasians gained immunity to all the germs that jumped from Eurasian animals into humans. And everything else follows from those Atlantic-Seaboard differential advantages with respect to guns, germs, and steel.&nbsp;</p><p>The theme of Piketty’s&nbsp;<em>Capital</em>—a brilliant book, if not without its major flaws (and what things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)—is: Capitalists control enough political levers to keep the profit rate around 5%, faster than economies grow. Only in exceptional eras of wars, revolutions, deep depressions, and the short post-WWII social-democractic age of very rapid growth will wealth at the top fail to outpace wealth in general. Hence in normal times income and wealth inequality is either already very high already or is rising fast. And everything else follows from that tendency toward high inequality.</p><p>The theme of&nbsp;<em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em>—a brilliant book, if not without its major flaws (and what things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)<em>—</em>is this:</p><p>The long 20th century—the first whose history was primarily&nbsp;<em>economic</em>, with the economy not painted scene-backdrop but rather revolutionizing humanity's life every single generation— taught humanity expensive lessons. In 1870 industrial research labs, modern corporations, globalization, and the market economy—which, as that genius Friedrich von Hayek most keen-sightedly observed, is tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutions—proved keys to the lock that had kept humanity in its desperately poor iron cage, with the only comfortable ones being the thugs with spears who took from the near-subsistence farmers, and those with whom they shared their extractions. And previously unimaginable economic growth revolutionized human life over and over, generation by generation.</p><p>We should, thereafter, have straightforwardly turned our technological power and wealth to building something very close to a utopia: a truly human world. From 1870-2010 was 140 years. Few in 1870 would have doubted that humanity more than ten times richer in material terms would build ourselves a utopia.</p><p>So what has gone wrong? Well, that idiot Friedrich von Hayek thought the unleashed market would do the whole job: “the market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the market”. But, as that genius Karl Polanyi put it: people will not stand for being told that there are no rights but property rights. They instead insist that “the market was made for man, not man for the market”. The market’s treating those whom society saw as equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought social explosion after explosion, blocking the road to utopia. They deserved communities, incomes, and stability. They needed their Polanyian rights to those things vindicated too.</p><p>Since 1870 humans—Theodore Roosevelt, John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Vladimir Lenin, Margaret Thatcher, Deng Xiaoping, and others— tried to think up solutions. They dissented from “the market giveth…” constructively and destructively. The demanded that the market do less, or different, and other institutions do more.&nbsp;</p><p>Only with a shotgun marriage of von Hayek’s market to Polanyi’ society, a marriage blessed by Keynes—a marriage that itself has so far failed its own&nbsp; sustainability tests—have we been able to even slouch towards utopia, and bring the El Dorado of a truly human world into view.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether we ever justify the full bill run up over the 140 years from 1870 to 2010 will likely depend on whether we remember and act upon that lesson.</p><p class="button-wrapper"

Where it is a challenge of adapting technology to manufacture at scale, China has excelled. But I do not grok oh, exactly, "science"-based industries are different in a way that matters. The O-ring theory—when you have enough scale you can achieve efficiencies so that you can afford the waste that comes from the lack of sufficient precision, and so win in the relatively simple where you still lose in the very complex—is just not adequate to motivate this large scale pattern:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Dan Wang</strong>: <em>Chinese Manufacturing</em>: ‘My research… is to… think about why China has been fairly good in certain areas, and why it is still pretty behind in some others…. Technologies are much more manufacturing-heavy, rather than science-heavy, China has for the most part figured that out. But wherever there is a lot of difficulty with the fundamental science, well there China is fairly weak…. solar photovoltaic, something like large-scale batteries that go into electric vehicles, and something like consumer electronics components… are things where the manufacturing challenge is considerable, but it’s all execution risk. There isn’t a lot of science involved…. Where China does face a lot of greater challenges are in things like chips, which require the integration of a lot of different areas of science… as well as wide-body aircraft, where the jet engines require things like aerodynamics, material science, and a whole lot of math. So now wherever the challenge is mostly manufacturing, China is pretty good…. I’m thinking about things in terms of manufacturing and science…. The analogy of a bodybuilder is the right one, to spend all of their time working on the biceps instead of working on the core…. The essence of dual circulation… is to make the rest of the world as dependent on China as Beijing can make it… and at the same time, it is to make sure that China is less dependent on the rest of the world…. That is a fairly robust strategy, and it has the benefit of simplicity…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-dan-wang-about-covid-chinese-manufacturing-and-chinas-response-to-ukraine/">https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-dan-wang-about-covid-chinese-manufacturing-and-chinas-response-to-ukraine/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>I would not say that Lael Brainard has been "dovish" in the past: I would say that she has been reality-based. I think she is still being reality-based. And, no, the risk the Fed will overreact and tighten us into a deep and unwarranted recession rather than a "rolling readjustment" is still a minor one:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Robert Armstrong &amp; Ethan Wu</strong>: <em>The Fed Gets Scary</em>: ‘Lael Brainard, who is lined up to be Fed vice-chair and has been dovish on monetary policy in the past, on Tuesday said “rapid” reduction of the Fed balance sheet could start in May. She made various other hawkish noises, as well…. Brainard’s tough words landed in a market that was already plenty worried that the Fed was going to tighten the US economy right into a big ol’ recession…. Do we need to worry even more now?… We don’t really know what the Fed balance sheet part of Brainard’s comments… portends. All we really know is that the Fed wanted to signal, again and more loudly, that they are going to tighten policy, soon, using every tool at hand. And this should make us worry that we will tighten right into a recession….

But it is not, really. It is not Hungary 1956 or Czechoslovakia 1968 or Poland at the end of the 1970s or Grozny either. It marks, rather, the limits of the power of a Muscovy that has 150 rather than 350 million people, spends 6% rather than 40% of national income on the military, faces a NATO willing to ship weapons to those it attacks, and comes at the end rather than in the middle of the development of Eastern-European nationalism.</p><p>The joker, of course, is that it still has lots and lots of nuclear weapons:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Edward Luce</strong>: <em>The World-Changing Meaning of Putin</em>: ‘Milestones are… the point at which history says it can no longer be ignored. February 24 was the date Russia invaded Ukraine…. Geopolitics is now divided between the west and a Chinese-Russian Eurasia…. Putin, whose loathing of the west has become his driving motive, has been the one to bring down the curtain. It is also ironic. Western strategists have tended to write off Russia as a declining power. But Russia’s waning status has put it in more of a hurry than China…. Joe Biden has in recent weeks turned into a Ronald Reagan-style crusader for global freedom…. America’s undeclared goal is for Russian regime change…. The most surprising response to Putin’s aggression has been the intensity of the west’s public reaction. It is an open question whether this will endure…. Trump and Le Pen would present a very different west to the one championed by Biden and Emmanuel Macron. A new era is undoubtedly upon us. But the west’s resolve is not yet a given…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/186659fa-9408-4868-b00c-a7bb5d1704a0">https://www.ft.com/content/186659fa-9408-4868-b00c-a7bb5d1704a0</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>As I see it, even the Kremlin's idea of Muscovy ‘Rus as a “great power” is limited to near hegemony in the "near abroad" and the recognition that interview counts in the Balkans in the Middle East—although, perhaps, not decisively. Also, the periodic American fits of action that it should promote "democracy" are annoying and need to be squelched by a global coalition of autocrats willing to do things like put their thumbs on the scales intervening in US politics to attempt to elect Donald Trump. Also nuclear weapons. But how can Muscovy ‘Rus think it is a great power in today's world on a scale higher than that of Italy? It is puzzling:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Anatol Lieven</strong>: <em>Inside Putin’s Circle: The Real Russian Elite</em>: ’Ruthless, greedy and cynical they may be—but they are not cynical about the idea of Russian greatness…. The… “oligarch[s]”… [were] broken by Putin…. The force that broke the oligarchs was the former KGB…. This group have remained remarkably stable and homogenous under Putin…. Putin and his immediate circle remain intensely resentful of the way in which the Soviet Union, Russia and their own service collapsed in the 1990s…. Five of Putin’s inner circle: Sergei Lavrov, 71, foreign minister; Sergei Naryshkin, 67, foreign intelligence chief; Nikolai Patrushev, 70, secretary of Russia’s security council; Igor Sechin, 61, chief executive of Rosneft; Sergei Shoigu, 66, defence minister. In his first years in power, Putin… could be regarded as “first among equals”…. No longer. Increasingly, even the siloviki have been publicly reduced to servants of the autocrat…. Insofar as top economic officials with “patriotic liberal” leanings were ever part of this inner core, they have long since been excluded…. These men are known in Russia as the “siloviki”… in the Irish phrase, “hard men”…. Putin and the siloviki have the sympathy of very large parts of the Russian population…. Above all, for deep historical, cultural, professional and personal reasons, the siloviki and the Russian official elite in general are utterly, irrevocably committed to the idea of Russia as a great power and one pole of a multipolar world. If you do not believe in that, you are not part of the Russian establishment, just as if you do not believe in US global primacy you are not part of the US foreign and security establishment…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/503fb110-f91e-4bed-b6dc-0d09582dd007">https://www.ft.com/content/503fb110-f91e-4bed-b6dc-0d09582dd007</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>My view of Lenin’s <em>State and Revolutio</em>n is that it is Lenin-as-utopian-dreamer. But even before the coup, he had never let his utopian dreams interfere with his political maneuverings either within the socialist movement or with respect to propaganda and action outside it. The utopian-dreamer had no influence on the power-wielder—save that the utopian dreams kept him from recognizing very important parts of the reality he was dealing with, and that was one of the principal factors leading to the Bolshevik disaster:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Robert Service</strong>: <em>Lenin: A Biography</em>: ’So why has Lenin been charged with monumental insincerity in relation to the book [<em>State and Revolution]</em>? The main reason lies in the contrast between the predictions made in <em>The State and Revolution</em> and the reality of Bolshevism in power. The State and Revolution described an imminent future when the working class would become the ruling class and ordinary workers themselves take the crucial decisions of state and society. Things turned out very differently after October 1917, when the Soviet state quickly became a one-party dictatorship that used force against industrial strikes and political protests by workers.

It’s a sort of fundamental attribution error by which our decisions and mistakes are based on context and circumstance, whereas theirs are based on their unchangeable character….

Rider Haggard Was Somewhat More Sophisticated than the Stereotype Suggests…</h2><p>His <em>King Solomon’s Mines</em> &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/kingsolomonsmine0000hagg_q8s2/page/n3/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/kingsolomonsmine0000hagg_q8s2/page/n3/mode/2up</a>&gt;… Consider the character of Umbopa-Ignosi. He starts out as the stereotype of the clever servant—and one who is uppity, and does not accept his subordinate place in the racial hierarchy, calling the narrator and his companions “white men” rather than “chiefs”. He ends the book the equivalent of the Roman Emperor Trajan, while the narrator is terrified at what he has gotten himself into. Yet it is not Umbopa-Ignosi who has changed.</p><p>At the start of the book:</p><blockquote><p>The evening before the day we had fixed for our departure the Zulu Khiva informed me that a Kafir was waiting to see me… a “Keshla” or ringed man; that is, he wore on his head the black ring, made of a species of gum polished with fat and worked up in the hair, which is usually assumed by Zulus on attaining a certain age or dignity. Also it struck me that his face was familiar to me. “Well,” I said at last, “What is your name?”</p><p>“Umbopa,” answered the man in a slow, deep voice.</p><p>“I have seen your face before.”</p><p>“Yes; the Inkoosi, the chief, my father, saw my face at the place of the Little Hand”—that is, Isandhlwana—“on the day before the battle.”</p><p>Then I remembered. I was one of Lord Chelmsford’s guides in that unlucky Zulu War, and had the good fortune to leave the camp in charge of some wagons on the day before the battle. While I was waiting for the cattle to be inspanned I fell into conversation with this man, who held some small command among the native auxiliaries, and he had expressed to me his doubts as to the safety of the camp. At the time I told him to hold his tongue, and leave such matters to wiser heads; but afterwards I thought of his words.</p><p>“I remember,” I said; “what is it you want?”</p><p>“It is this, ‘Macumazahn.’” That is my Kafir name, and means the man who gets up in the middle of the night, or, in vulgar English, he who keeps his eyes open. “I hear that you go on a great expedition far into the North with the white chiefs from over the water. Is it a true word?”</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>“I hear that you go even to the Lukanga River, a moon’s journey beyond the Manica country. Is this so also, ‘Macumazahn?’”</p><p>“Why do you ask whither we go? What is it to you?” I answered suspiciously, for the objects of our journey had been kept a dead secret.</p><p>“It is this, O white men, that if indeed you travel so far I would travel with you.”</p><p>There was a certain assumption of dignity in the man’s mode of speech, and especially in his use of the words “O white men,” instead of “O Inkosis,” or chiefs, which struck me. “You forget yourself a little,” I said. “Your words run out unawares. That is not the way to speak. What is your name, and where is your kraal? Tell us, that we may know with whom we have to deal.”</p></blockquote><p>And at the end;</p><blockquote><p>“Behold your king!… Go fight and fall for him, as is the duty of brave men, and cursed and shameful for ever be the name of him who shrinks from death for his king, or who turns his back to the foe. Behold your king, chiefs, captains, and soldiers! Now do your homage to the sacred Snake, and then follow on, that Incubu and I may show you a road to the heart of Twala’s host.” There was a moment’s pause, then suddenly a murmur arose from the serried phalanxes before us, a sound like the distant whisper of the sea, caused by the gentle tapping of the handles of six thousand spears against their holders’ shields. Slowly it swelled, till its growing volume deepened and widened into a roar of rolling noise, that echoed like thunder against the mountains, and filled the air with heavy waves of sound. Then it decreased, and by faint degrees died away into nothing, and suddenly out crashed the royal salute.</p><p>Ignosi, I thought to myself, might well be a proud man that day, for no Roman emperor ever had such a salutation from gladiators “about to die.”</p><p>Ignosi acknowledged this magnificent act of homage by lifting his battle-axe, and then the Greys filed off in a triple-line formation, each line containing about one thousand fighting men, exclusive of officers. When the last companies had advanced some five hundred yards, Ignosi put himself at the head of the Buffaloes, which regiment was drawn up in a similar three-fold formation, and gave the word to march, and off we went, I, needless to say, uttering the most heartfelt prayers that I might emerge from that entertainment with a whole skin.</p></blockquote>
