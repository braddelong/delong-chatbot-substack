First: A Platonic Dialogue:

Polemarkhos: Look at this! Is this still true?

Does a county’s vaccination rate depend more on its political leanings or its median household
income?

30% of the difference in vaccination rates between counties can be explained by the two-party vote 
share for Biden, while 21% can be
explained by median household income

support the bipartisan mini-bill were no longer going to support ita€!. Buta€! this has always been 
and remains an issue in Democratsa€™ handsa€’’especially Joe Manchina€™ s hands. Republicans are 
just players on a chess board in which Democrats
are making the moves. And Joe Manchin made this pretty clear this morning. Republicans have been 
trying to take control of the debate, suggesting they need to be convinced by Joe Biden that 
therea€™ s absolutely positively no a€celinkagea€D or that hea€™ 11 agree not to pass any more 
infrastructure, hard or soft, with only Democratic votes. But Manchin seems clear. We have our 
mini-bill deal. Leta€™ s take the win and move on. Of course wea€™ re
also going to do soft infrastructure through reconciliation^!. Wea€™rea€! going to have a lot more 
dramaa€I. But [Manchin] is pretty clear that train isna€™t stopping just because Republicans are

technology from a supporting role to a central role. It isna€™t just that messaging became more
