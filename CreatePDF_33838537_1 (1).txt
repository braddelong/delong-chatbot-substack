Figuring out how to do antitrust in the age of the attention economy is really, really hard:

Ben Thompson: The FTCa€™ s Google Documents, the Staff Memo, the Economists Memo'. a€~The 
fundamental premise of the Politico article, along
with much of the antitrust chatter in Washington, misses the point: Google is dominant because 
consumers like it. That doesna€™ t mean the company
didna€™ t act anticompetitively, or that we shouldna€™ t think seriously about acquisitions or 
contracts or advertising. Such thinking, though, has to start
with   a certain degree of humility about the fundamentally different nature of the Internet and 
how it is leading to these Aggregator-type outcomes. It really
might be different this time.a€!

a reality, and Gorbachev understood the need for at least $100

Six Paragraphs:

Martin Sandbu: US Stimulus Package Leaves Europe Standing in the Dust: a€~Europe and the US will 
loom less large in the global economy as emerging countries outperform
their growth. That is inevitable. What we do not know is how fast that US and European dominance 
will be whittled awaya€!. US president Joe Biden has delayed his countrya€™ s
relative decline. EU leaders, however, look set to accelerate theirs. Bidena€™ s $1.9tn fiscal 
stimulus package, passed last week, may not be literally visible from space, but it is
certainly  of planetary scale. In the OECDa€™ s March update to its forecasts, the organisation 
estimated that the US stimulus will add one whole percentage point to projected
global growth. It more than doubled its 2021 growth forecast for the US itself, from 3.3 to 6.5 per 
cent. Bidena€™ s own administration foresees US output returning to its potential
three to four years faster because of the stimulusa€l

Neil Irwin: Move Over, Nerds. Ita€™ s the Politiciansa€™ Economy Now: a€~a€oeThis legislation has 
everything to do with restoring the confidence of the American people in
democracy and in their government, and if we cana€™ t respond to the pain of working families 
today, we dona€™ t deserve to be here,a€D said Senator Bernie Sanders of the
Biden bill, known as the American Rescue Plan Act. Republicans unanimously opposed the Biden 
legislation, but it has not been quite the scorched-earth opposition to deficit­
widening action seen during the Obama administration^!. f the concerns described by Mr. Summers and 
Mr. Blanchard about the size of the new relief bill materialize, and the
result is excessive inflation or some type of crisis, Democrats will pay a price for their 
actionsa€!

Duncan Black: Ia€™m Gonna Tell You How Ita€™ s Gonna Be: a€~Yes hea€™ 11 fade away: 
a€oeEx-president Donald Trump finds himself adrift while in political exile. And
Republicans, and even some allies, say he is disorganized, torn between playing the role of 
antagonist and party leader. a€~There is no apparatus, no structure and part of that is due
to     a lack of political understanding on Trumpa€™ s behalfa€™ , said a person close to the 
former president, noting that Trump has struggled to learn the ropes of post-presidential
politicking .a€D Hea€™ s lazy, stupid, and a micromanager, and at least somewhat radioactive at the 
moment. Also it isna€™ t a secret that he stiffs everybody. Not a magnet for
the   best peoplea€l LINK:

John Paul Koning: Hacksilver: a€~The first coins were invented in Lydiaa€! in the 7th Century 
B.C.Ea€!. Belief among some archaeologists that a form of proto-coinage had been
invented prior to the Lydians and their electrum coins. This proto-coinage came in the form of 
sealed and regulated bags of hacksilvera€!. Morris Silver, an economist who
researches ancient economies, describes Mesopotamian texts of the middle of the second half of the 
third millennium that show silver being used by street vendors, to pay rent,
purchase dates, oil, barley, animals, slaves, and real estatea€!. Assyrian economic texts from the 
7th C B.C. show that the majority of all types of payments were already being
made    in silver, including those for tribute, craftsmen obligations, and for conscription and 
labor commutationsa€!. 6 minas (c. 3 kg) of silver are owed by two men to the merchant
Ashur-idi. One third of the loan must be paid by the next harvest and the rest at a later date. If 
it is not repaid by that time it will accrue interest charged at a monthly ratea€!.

Hacksilvera€! silver ingots, hacked pieces of ingot, silver scrap, and cut up bits of silver 
jewellerya€!. One reason for the hacking or cutting-up of silver may have been to make
small changea€!. Another less obvious reason for hackinga€! is that it may have been a way for 
merchants to check for qualitya€!. For over a thousand years, silver circulated as a
medium of exchange, in hacked form. The big innovation with coins is the stamp. Because we trust 
the issuera€™ s brand, we needna€™ t weigh out or assay (i.e. smash/hack)
silver prior to engaging in trade. So trade was much more fluida€!. Proto-coinersa€! suggest that 
bagged and sealed hacksilver was already circulating in a way similar to coins.
Some authority, perhaps a government administrator or a merchant, pre-weighed a certain amount of 
good hacksilver, bagged it, and affixed their seala€!. If the proto-coiners are
right, thata€! pushes the effective date of coinage technology back by 500 or so yearsa€!.


One of the key hoards around which the debate revolves is the Tel Dor hoarda€! north of Haifaa€! 
excavated in the 1990s by Ephraim Sterna€!. The Tel Dor hoard dates to
somewhere between 1000 B.C.E and 900 B.C.E. The hoard consists of a jug containing 17 bundles of 
hacksilver wrapped up by linen cloth (see photo of one of the bundles
below)a€!.  The silver weighs 8.5 kilogramsa€! the equivalent of forty-six years of laboura€!. The 
bundles were closed with bullae, or clay seals. But these seals do not contain a
name,  just a patterna€!. One of these bundlesa€! registered at 490.5 gramsa€!. The Babylonian 
shekela€! each shekel weighed 8.3g, and 60 shekels was worth 1 mina. Thus a mina
would have weighed 500 gramsa€! as if the bundle was a very large denomination mina coina€!

Michael R. Gordon & Dustin Volz: Russian Disinformation Campaign Aims to Undermine Confidence in 
Pfizer, Other Covida€“19 Vaccines, U.S. Officials Say: a€~Russian
intelligence agencies have mounted a campaign to undermine confidence in Pfizer Inc.a€™ s and other 
Western vaccines, using online publications that in recent months have
questioned  the vaccinesa€™ development and safety, U.S. officials saida€!. Websites played up the 
vaccinesa€™ risk of side effects, questioned their efficacy, and said the U.S.
had  rushed the Pfizer vaccine through the approval process, among other false or misleading 
claimsa€!. a€oeWe can say these outlets are directly linked to Russian intelligence
services,a€D the Global Engagement Center official said of the sites behind the disinformation 
campaign. a€oeTheya€™re all foreign-owned, based outside of the United States.
They   vary a lot in their reach, their tone, their audience, but theya€™ re all part of the 
Russian propaganda and disinformation ecosy stem.a€D In addition, Russian state media and
Russian government Twitter accounts have made overt efforts to raise concerns about the cost and 
safety of the Pfizer vaccine in what experts outside the U.S. government say is an
effort to promote the sale of Russiaa€™ s rival Sputnik V vaccinea€!

Holman Christian Standard Bible: Leviticus 16: a€~The LORD spoke to Mosesa€!. a€oe Aaron will 
present the bull for his sin offering and make atonement for himself and his
household. Next he will take the two goats and place them before the LORD at the entrance to the 
tent of meeting. After Aaron casts lotsm for the two goats, one lot for the LORD
and   the other for azazel, he is to present the goat chosen by lot for the LORD and sacrifice it 
as a sin offering .p lOBut the goat chosen by lot for azazel is to be presented alive before
the LORD to make purification with it by sending it into the wilderness for azazela€!. When he has 
finished purifying the most holy place, the tent of meeting, and the altar, he is to
present the live male goat. Aaron will lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess 
over it all the Israelitesa€™ wrongdoings and rebellious actsa€”all their sins. He

is to put them on the goata€™ s head and send it away into the wildernessa by the man appointed for 
the task.ah The goat will carry on it all their wrongdoings into a desolate land,
and he will release it therea€L The man who released the goat for azazel is to wash his clothes and 
bathe his body with water; afterward he may reenter the campa€!
