Goldstone</strong> (2002): <em>Efflorescences &amp; Economic Growth in World History: Rethinking the “Rise of the West” &amp; the Industrial Revolution</em> (<em>Journal of World History</em> 13:2 (Fall 2002), pp. 323-389) &lt;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078976">https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078976</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1E8indGK9E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1E8indGK9E</a>&gt;:</p><p>Before the Industrial and French revolutions, European societies and economies departed from the ideal-typical view of "feudal" economically and technologically stagnant agrarian societies dominated by a predatory elite that wasted all surpluses. Rather, as early as the eleventh century A.D., northern European agriculture was improved by the adoption of wind and water power, heavy plows and rigid horse-collars; from at least the twelfth century onward the urban trade centers of Venice, Genoa, the Rhenish imperial cities, and the Hanse blossomed into a trans-European set of urban networks that combined management of urban and rural market-oriented craft production ("proto-industrialization") with a flourishing intra-European and extra-European global trade; and from at least the sixteenth century national rulers brought their unruly agrarian elites to heel by building bureaucratized central ("absolutist") governments that provided a rule of law and framework for the protection and accumulation of private property and capital…’</p><p>Every one of the above trends that are observed in Europe and labeled as proof of "early modern" character—technical improvements in agriculture and production providing rising total output and per capita productivity (including aggressive transformation of the natural landscape); vast urban-based regional and global trade networks supporting wealthy merchant classes; and increasingly centralized and bureaucratized political regimes that created ordered territories and subordinated elites—are also widely evident outside of Europe prior to the eighteenth century, in China, Japan, Southeast Asia, India, and the Ottoman Empire, and often earlier and in a higher state of development…. Historians of these regions have become quite comfortable in referring to the years from perhaps a.D. 1000 or 1300 to 1800, as also "early modern.”… The major agrarian bureaucratic societies of Asia shared in basically similar dynamics regarding population growth, inflation, social mobility, state finances, elite competition, and popular unrest, lasting at least from the sixteenth through the mid-nineteenth centuries…. Thus scholars now speak of multiple "early modernities”…</p><p>There is no necessary or sufficient connection between such widespread phenomena as urbanization, widespread domestic and international trade, and the growth of centralized and bureaucratized territorial states, and the sub sequent emergence of industrialization and constitutional government. The latter must therefore be what I have called the outcome of a "peculiar path" (Goldstone 2002), or an unusual conjuncture, rather than of a general pathway that leads from "early" to "full" modernity. As Joel Mokyr points out, the lack of a transition to industrialization in the Netherlands and other advanced pre-industrial states "was not the exception. Britain was" (1999b, 18). The pattern of change in Britain was not simply an accelerated version of a more general and widespread trend to modern economic and political organization…’</p><p>The unity of the global social processes from 1300 to 1800 can be more accurately embraced under the label "late pre-industrial" or, if one wishes to avoid privileging industrialization, as simply "late premodern." Indeed, a sensible periodization of world history might run from "ancient" (3500-500 b.c.) to "classical" or "axial" (500 b.c.-a.d. 500) to medieval (a.D. 500-1350), to late premodern (1350-1900) to modern (1900- )…’</p><p>Let me propose… "efflorescence”… as the opposite of "crisis.”… An "efflorescence" is a relatively sharp, often unexpected upturn in significant demographic and economic indices, usually accompanied by political expansion and institution building and cultural synthesis and consol idation. Such "efflorescences" typically involve both Smithian and Schumpeterian growth, in a mutually reinforcing fashion. They are often seen by contemporaries or successors as "golden ages" of creativity and accomplishments. Moreover, they often set new patterns for thought, political organization, and economic life that last for many generations. The role of "efflorescences" in understanding world history is to replace the dichotomy between "stagnation" (seen as typically pre modern) and "growth" (seen as typically modern). Rather, I shall argue that throughout history, all societies have experienced periods of efflorescence… distinct from Kuznetzian "modern" eco nomic growth founded on the continual and conscious application of scientific and technological progress to economic activity…’</p><p>Pointing to Golden Age Holland and Tokugawa Japan, as well as Song China… intensive orientation of households to the market, and specialization and division of labor, can unleash substantial growth. And they acknowledge that this is not merely "Smithian" growth, but cannot be disentangled from "Schumpeterian growth," since market growth and specialization also encourage innovation and reward new technologies. Thus Golden Age Holland innovated in shipping; warehousing; finance; and glass, beer, and textile production, and greatly expanded the use of wind power (de Vries and van der Woude 1997). Tokugawa Japan innovated in agricultural techniques and tools, and expanded its silk production to replace Chinese imports (Hunter 2000); Song China developed extensive water power and iron works and shipping (Hartwell 1966, Jones 1988). One could add that similar innovations in power and agriculture marked the high Middle Ages in Europe. One could further note that eighteenth-century England's advances in tex tile spinning machinery and metallurgy were also wonderful preindustrial inventions, similar to those already mentioned in their impact, but not unprecedented in world history (Elvin 1973, 1988; Hartwell 1962). Were these episodes, and others like them, truly an onset of "modern" economic growth? As we noted above, every single one of these episodes—Golden Age Holland, Tokugawa Japan, Song China, the High Middle Ages in Europe, and eighteenth-century England—have advocates who claim that they were "early modern" in character, and marked an onset of "modern" patterns of growth…’</p><p>Efflorescences, or periods of limited but exceptional innovation, productivity increase, and acceleration of economic growth are not uncommon in world history….. Their two key characteristics: the period of growth is limited and followed by absolute stagnation or decline, and even during the "golden age" total GDP growth is never sustained at over one percent per year…. The reasons for the emergence of such efflorescences… international trade and sustained contact lead to a mixing of cultures and ideas… in places… in which people, goods, and techniques are focused on meeting multiple commercial demands…. Such efflorescences also seem more likely during periods of reconstruction following a collapse or massive challenge or change in government or society that unleashes new energies or social groups or provides integration and order over larger territories…’</p><p>Maxine Berg (1994, 207)… noted, it was not the spinning machinery itself (in operation since 1770) that made England supreme, but rather the application of steam power to spinning, to water and surface transport, to brick-making, grain-thresh ing, iron-making, shoveling, construction, and all sorts of manufacturing processes that transformed Britain's economy…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/publish/post/40103689?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/publish/post/40103689?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p></blockquote><blockquote><div id="youtube2-J1E8indGK9E" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;J1E8indGK9E&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J1E8indGK9E?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/publish/post/40103689&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/publish/post/40103689"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>(Remember: You can subscribe to this… weblog-like newsletter… here:&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>There’s a free email list.
