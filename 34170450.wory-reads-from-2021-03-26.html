The Washington Center for Equitable Growth commends Congress and the president for passing a federal rescue package that meets the scale of the problem and for taking steps to put our nation on a path to recovery that is strong, stable, and broadly shared. In particular, the plan provides a third round of critical relief checks in response to the coronavirus recession and extends enhanced Unemployment Insurance, ensuring workers who have lost their jobs or had their hours cut will continue receiving the supplemental $300 per week through September 6. Research supported by Equitable Growth shows that robust UI benefits and direct stimulus, scaled to meet economic needs, can help mitigate hardship for individuals and families while also boosting the wider economy, preventing a more severe downturn. Also notable is the law’s commitment to invest so that our nation emerges from the coronavirus recession stronger, more resilient, and more equitable. Key investments include: Nearly $100 billion to combat the public health crisis… $350 billion in funding for state and local governments… More than $100 billion to expand and improve the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit… $130 billion to help schools reopen safely and $45 billion for child care relief… $12 billion for nutritional assistance… But while the investments made in the American Rescue Plan are at an appropriate scale given current conditions, a growing body of research highlights the ongoing structural reforms that are necessary to address the underlying racial, climate, and economic crises laid all the more bare by the coronavirus pandemic… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/press/equitable-growth-responds-to-passage-of-american-rescue-plan/">https://equitablegrowth.org/press/equitable-growth-responds-to-passage-of-american-rescue-plan/</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/publish/post/34170450?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/publish/post/34170450?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Worthy Reads from Elsewhere:</h3><p>1) <strong>Zeynep Tufekci</strong>: <em>Aerosols</em>: ‘Incredible New Zealand study on a mystery transmission in a quarantine hotel. For a while, a garbage can was suspected—one of the very, very few known suspected cases of fomite transmission. Turns out… it’s aerosols. What a Kuhnian year this has been…. This year will clearly force an updating of our understanding of role of aerosol transmission for respiratory pathogens. PLUS it’s almost text-book Kuhnian in how it’s happening: resistance, “epicycling” and then paradigm shift. Yes, feels like cold-comfort now as we are and have been late, but we’re here. The new CDC director has already cited importance of aerosols as one of things that most surprised her—along with a good chunk of people…. Nothing wrong with a (sensible) amount of hand-washing but the issue is that our mitigations need a hierarchy of energy and resources. Deep cleaning is still a big thing, parks/beaches are still shut down. Clearly—very clearly—our stack was wrong-ordered…. It’s places like Japan and South Korea and Hong Kong etc., whose scientists knew from day one that airborne transmission was a key route—disregarding global official guidance essentially—that managed to beat back outbreaks to get back to near normalcy…. Many had been through SARS and they have top-notch infectious disease specialists and epidemiologist. Reading their documents from February/March of 2020 is mind-blowing. They went their own way. It’s all there. I’m still not sure why the global orgs were so wrong on this. Did these countries have special institutional knowledge (e.g. from previous outbreaks) that just wasn’t considered by the rest of the world? What happened?… Sometimes people say “wait, doesn’t everybody know airborne transmission is important?” If you follow the right experts on Twitter, I guess? Meanwhile, a library in one of the highest-educated US counties is “quarantining” returned books for seven days…</p><p>LINK: &lt;</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1373825780384432130&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;This is what I’ve heard from all over the US and most if the world, nonstop, for a year now—exceptions are countries that went their own way from very early on, on airborne transmission risks, like Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, etc. &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;zeynep&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;zeynep tufekci&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Mon Mar 22 02:36:05 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;@zeynep I have jury duty in Boston in May.

The law of the sea requires such vessels to carry gps-based automatic identification systems (ais) that broadcast where they are, and to keep those systems switched on. Some boats, however, failed to comply. There were more than 550 instances of vessels not transmitting their locations for over a day. This regular radio silence stoked fears that the boats concerned were sneaking into Ecuador’s waters to plunder its fish. Both local officials and China’s ambassador to Ecuador denied this, and said all the boats were sticking to the rules. In October, however, HawkEye 360, a satellite operator based in Virginia, announced it had detected vessels inside Ecuador’s eez on 14 occasions when the boats in question were not transmitting ais (see map). HawkEye’s satellites could pinpoint these renegades by listening for faint signals emanating from their navigation radars and radio communications. HawkEye’s satellites are so-called smallsats, about the size of a large microwave oven. They are therefore cheap to build and launch. HawkEye deployed its first cluster, of three of them, in 2018. They are now in an orbit that takes them over both of Earth’s poles. This means that, as the planet revolves beneath them, every point on its surface can be monitored at regular intervals… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/03/18/small-cheap-spy-satellites-mean-theres-no-hiding-place">https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/03/18/small-cheap-spy-satellites-mean-theres-no-hiding-place</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>6) <strong>Heather Cox Richardson</strong>: <em>March 19, 2021</em>: ‘Asked about what happened at the Capitol on January 6, 87% percent of Americans say it is either “very important” (69%) or “somewhat important” (18%) for law enforcement officials to find and prosecute the insurrectionists. Where those numbers fall apart is among Republicans who believe that former president Trump won the 2020 election…. 66% of people who believe that Trump won the election say that the riot at the Capitol is getting too much attention. Eighty-two percent of them said Trump’s conduct leading up to the insurrection was not wrong and that the House should not have voted to impeach him. The danger of the Big Lie—the false idea that Trump actually won the 2020 election—was always that it would convince Trump supporters to fight for him not because they thought they would be fighting to overturn the U.S. government, but because they thought they would be defending it…. The lawyer for Schaffer, the Indiana man, is trying to get leniency for his client by arguing that the man was encouraged by Trump. “People have the right to believe the highest elected official…. My client is not responsible for what happened on January 6”… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/march-19-2021">https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/march-19-2021</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p></p><p>7) <strong>Sergei Guriev &amp; Elias Papaioannou</strong>: <em>The Enduring Populist Threat</em>: ‘The “them” versus “us” populist narrative does not capture merely a conflict between haves and have-nots…. With so many populists still firmly in power, the notion that the trend will simply dissipate following Trump’s defeat seems like wishful thinking. In fact, even in the US, Trump’s brand of right-wing populism has not been definitively repudiated….. Economists often used “populism” as shorthand for a particular brand of inefficient macroeconomic policy…. Latin American-style left-wing populism… has largely been superseded by a right-wing variant with little fondness for redistributive economic policies… xenophobic nationalism and religious conservatism… identity and morality, not class…. Populists subscribe to a “thin-centered ideology” that divides society into two “homogenous and antagonistic” groups: the pure people and the corrupt elite… a template into which one can force a worldview or discourse. And it brooks no nuance…. The same groups that have lost their jobs in industries like manufacturing have been among the most likely to vote for populist leaders and causes, not only in the US, but also in the UK and Western Europe. Nor is it a coincidence that support for populists surged after the 2008 global economic crisis…. Post-crisis austerity only intensified voters’ resentment…. The coronavirus pandemic… could well fan the populist flame…. The “them” versus “us” populist narrative does not capture merely a conflict between haves and have-nots. If it did, a cartoon plutocrat like Trump would not have been able to campaign as the voice of the people…. Populism reflects the rejection of… freedom of expression, environmental protection, gender equality, racial and cultural diversity, and tolerance…. Economic insecurity likely compounds… feelings of uncertainty and isolation…. The link between cultural and economic insecurity… may explain why immigration is so central to the modern populist platform…. As for Trump, early evidence suggests that his policies did not have a profound economic impact. But, like many populists, he did mount attacks on institutions, undermining confidence… significantly undermined civility and trust, with its associated impact on productivity and well-being…. Finally, there are the excess deaths caused by Trump’s utter mishandling of the pandemic – a failure so great that some accuse him of “pandemicide”… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/the-enduring-populist-threat-by-sergei-guriev-and-elias-papaioannou-2021-03">https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/the-enduring-populist-threat-by-sergei-guriev-and-elias-papaioannou-2021-03</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>8) <strong>Matt Yglesias</strong>: <em>Weekend Update, March 20</em>: ‘Along the way Jude Doyle named me as one of several “people who actively hate trans people and women, argue ceaselessly against our civil rights, and in many cases, have a public history of directly, viciously abusing trans people and/or cis women in their industry.” I objected on Twitter that I do not in fact hate trans people or women, nor do I argue against their civil rights even sporadically, much less ceaselessly. Many people agreed with me, which was nice to see since it’s clearly true. Unfortunately, several other people argued that it was fine to write in a public forum that I “argue ceaselessly” against civil rights for women and trans people on the grounds that they find some other thing I did objectionable, or that some other parts of Doyle’s article are true. I reject this. People should write true things rather than false things… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/weekend-update-march-20">https://www.slowboring.com/p/weekend-update-march-20</a>&gt;</p>
