Growth and Decay Processes

Economics gives us numbers we can count that change over time:
prices and quantities

Economics studies emergent macro outcomes that are not
designed or intended by the micro-level actors

Simplest micro-level processes

• Transmission (or increase)

• Decay

Proportional growth—compound interest

• The time over which some growth process takes place

• The rate at which growth (or shrinkage) takes place

• The amount that the variable grows to

•   T, g, y... with little t standing in for any potential moment

Don't get snowed I Accurately assess how important or
consequential things are!

Growth and Decay Processes

Transmission and increase gives us proportional or
exponential growth—compound interest

• The time over which some growth process takes
place

• The rate at which growth (or shrinkage) takes
place

• The amount that the variable grows to

• X g, y... with little t standing in for any
potential moment

important or consequential things are!

Decay gives us exponential convergence

The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics...

•  Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (c.
780-850)

• By name: answer to: "OK. But which
Muhammad ibn Musa wandering around
Baghdad under al-Mamun are we talking
about?"

• Author of: Al-Kitab al-MukhtasarfiHisab al-
Jabr wa'I-Mukabala—The Compendious Book
on Calculation by Completion and Balancing

•  Worked in Baghdad at the House of Wisdom
established by the Kalif Al-Mamun


Mathematics as a Series of What-If? Machines...

A way of doing a huge number of
calculations about what might be
happening at once

Seeing which of these calculations satisfy
whatever the consistency and coherence
conditions are

And then summarizing the results of all of
them in a very small space

But the technique rapidly becomes


Listen to Richard Feynman

"An analogy.... The Maya Indians were interested in... Venus....
To make calculations, the Maya had invented a system of bars
and dots to represent numbers... and had rules by which to
calculate and predict not only the risings and settings of [the
War-Star] Venus, but other celestial phenomena....

"Only a few Maya priests could do such elaborate
calculations....

"Suppose we were to ask one of them how to do just one
step in the process of predicting when Venus will next rise as
a  morning  star—subtracting  two  numbers  How  would  the
priest explain?....


Listen to Richard Feynman

"He could either teach us the... bars and dots and the rule... or he
could tell us what he was really doing:

"'Suppose we want to subtract 236 from 584. First, count out 584
beans and put them in a pot. Then take out 236 beans and put them
to   one side. Finally, count the beans left in the pot. That number is the
result.  '

"You might say, 'My Quetzalcoatl! What tedium... what a job!'

"To which the priest would reply, 'That's why we have the rules   The

rules are tricky, but they are a much more efficient way of getting the
answer.... We can predict the appearance of Venus by counting beans
(which is slow, but easy to understand) or by using the tricky rules
(which is much faster, but you must spend years in school to learn
them)."'


The Uses of Math: Isaac Newton

• Isaac Newton (1642-1727):

•  Philosophise Naturalis Principia Mathematica

—Mathematical Principles of Natural
Philosophy

• Worked in Cambridge at the university there

•  These people did their work to make your lives
easier:

• Arithmetic and accounting

• Algebra and calculus

•  What-if machines—ways of doing a huge
number of potential calculations all at once...



dy/dt = g(y - a)

Exponential Growth

start at t = -500 with y = a + 0.006
g = 0.01; a = 10

• starts very near 10                       ³⁰

• does nothing for a long time—stays very
near 10—then explodes

• y = 10 + exp(.01(t-10))                    20

• y = a + c[exp(g(t-a))]

it EXP J J // E"

•  It's a function: we feed it a number x, and get out exp(x) (or EAx)

• We can calculate it:

• exp(x) = l+x+(xA2)/2+(xA3)/6+(xA4)/24+...

• exp(O)=l

• exp(l)=2.71828182846...

•  But we don't have to...

•  Over 1618-1731, Napier, Oughtred, Bernoulli, Leibnitz, and Euler did it
for us...


Exponential Convergence

• Convergence

• dy/dt =-g(y - k)

•  start at t = 0 with y = 0

•  g = 0.01; k = 100

•  heads rapidly for k

• and then stays there

•  (y - k) halves in absolute value
in... guess what? 0.693/g

•  (y - k) shrinks to a thousandth
of its initial absolute value

in (Tiiacc       £ QI /a


Combine the Two: Logistic Growth

• dy/dt = g(y-a)(k-y)/k

• y = a + (k-a)[exp(gx)]/(k-a+exp(gx)-l)

• a is the initial population

•  k is the carrying capacity

•  g is the unimpeded growth rate (you'll see this called "r")

•  Pierre-Francois Verhulst in 1838, building a mathematical model of
Thomas Malthus' Essay on the Principal of Population

•  Rediscovered by McKendrick, by Pearl and Reed, and by Lotka


Logistic Growth


-10                         -5                           0                           5              
            10

Things to Remember

• Asymptote: a (in the negative x-axis direction, for growth and logistic)

• Asymptote: k (in the positive x-axis direction, for convergence and logistic)

•  Rule of 72: 72 divided by the growth rate gives you the doubling (for
growth) or halving (for convergence) time

•  Rule of 720: Multiply the doubling time by 10 to get the thousand-fold time

• Why 72? Why not 0.693?

• 72 is easier to do in your head

•  72 = 36x2 = 24x3 = 18x4 = 12x6 = 9x8

• 72 can be better if things come in steps...
