KeyBanc’s Justin Patterson… sector weight from overweigh…. Since the start of the year, Meta… down… 61%…. TikTok… slowdown in online ad spending… <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/">Apple’s</a>&nbsp;iOS privacy…</p></blockquote><p>The perspective:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Barry Ritholtz: </strong><a href="https://ritholtz.com/2022/10/meta-four/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Meta-Four</a>: ‘We discussed how ephemeral and short-lived great success can be yesterday…. I had no idea it was a metaphor for what would happen a few hours later… [to] Facebook…. FB does not have all that durable of a grip on its user base…. [Thus] META’s moat is far shallower and narrower than that of other FAANGM firms…. META… had already fallen 50%… [by] mid-March…. <a href="https://twitter.com/awealthofcs/status/1585668489842401283">Ben Carlson</a> points out that “Facebook’s market cap has declined by ~$800 billion since then… greater than the current market cap of every company in the S&amp;P 500 save for Apple, Microsoft, Google &amp; Amazon…. </p><p>Musk, he is not someone you want to be competing with… disruptive, innovative, and capable of thinking way, way outside the box…. Tesla shareholders… [fear a] shiny object distracting Elon…. Facebook shareholders… realizing… in addition to TikTok… they have another social media competitor fighting them. </p><p>Zuck’s sketchy respect for its user data or privacy that was once the firm’s greatest source of profits…. Facebook’s business model was t-boned by Apple… [not] fatal… but nobody walks away… when a vehicle that large plows into you. TikTok stealing users, Apple breaking their magic data source for advertisers, and now… an unpredictable but brilliant competitor…</p></blockquote><p>And the rant:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ed Citron:</strong> <a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/mark-zuckerberg-is-going-to-kill">Mark Zuckerberg Is Going To Kill His Company</a>: ‘In the most charitable interpretation… [Zuckerberg’s] company [has] grow[n] from “catch up with what your friends are up to!” t… discordant… algorithms… trick[ing] you into doing stuff…. Instagram and Facebook… use their users… your feed… sifting through cat litter for… nuggets…. You increase active users yet decrease revenue… by turning your previously-beloved social networks into social engineering traps. Meta has… taken two products… people liked… and, in their desperation, tried to wring more money out of them by annoying their users into submission….</p><p>Zuckerberg’s metaverse, one of the stupidest things I have ever seen a company pursue…. As funny as it is that Zuckerberg responded to “don’t spend as much money on the metaverse” with “I will now spend more on the metaverse,” anybody with half a brain can see that he is burning his company to the ground… peak founder-brain…. $15 billion… <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-lost-15-billion-building-the-metaverse-reality-labs-money-2022-10">without it being immediately obvious where that money went or why it went there</a>. We do know where <em>some</em> of it went, though - into Horizon Worlds, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/meta-metaverse-horizon-worlds-zuckerberg-facebook-internal-documents-11665778961">a subpar virtual reality platform that barely anybody uses or likes</a>…. No excuse… awkward, bad and ugly…. [The] company… [has] an abundance of resources… “great minds”… the ability to hire almost any engineer…. </p><p>A mismanaged corporate behemoth run by a clueless goon that has been running on empty…. Profitable metaverses… are… video games. Had Zuckerberg, say, acquired Second Life, and then used billions of dollars to turn it into a rich, customizable world run either in a browser or on a computer, that would have made a great deal more sense. Except… Zuckerberg… [lacks] the humility, awareness or experience of the world he’s creating products for to reliably know what people want, or might want, or will ever want…. [A] likely… slow decline… as people flee these platforms, with investors… calling for Zuckerberg’s head as he burns $15+ billion a year trying to prove that the world wants to chat to Wii avatars…</p></blockquote><p>There is one thing I would want to stress: </p><p>There is a <em><strong>HHHUUUGGGEEE</strong></em> difference between a company as a <em><strong>profit-making</strong></em> entity on the one hand, a company as a <em><strong>productive</strong></em> entity on the other hand, and a company as an <em><strong>influencer</strong></em> entity—as something that changes our lives and our society—on the third. </p><p>To date Elon Musk’s enterprises have been unsuccessful as profit-makers, pathfinders as producers, and are highly likely to change the world for all of our great good on the third—and, yes, I do think he is an unpredictable and highly erratic chaos monkey. But he has not thrown away his shots. And people have willingly given him enough ammunition that a number of them have been world-benefitting bullseyes.</p><p>By contrast, Zuckerberg’s enterprises have been unbelievably and extravagantly successful as <em><strong>profit-makers</strong></em>, valuable at start but increasingly annoying as <em><strong>producers</strong></em>, and as <em><strong>influencers</strong></em>—well, some people just want to <s>watch</s> <strong>make</strong> the world burn.</p><p>Perhaps Facebook is almost over as a profit-making entity. That is what Ms. Market fears, as she assesses the danger that it may get caught between Tim Cook and Elon Musk and ground into dust, But Facebook on its way to irrelevance still could spread a lot of accelerants and throw off a lot of sparks with respect to its effects on society.</p><p>And do not forget this: Even though, to date, Elon Musk has been very good for the world (and has been good for his investors only to the extent that they have been able to sell to others who even more completely buy his dreams), there is no guarantee that his Self-Driving Twitter will be an equal boon for humanity.</p><p>It is odd: I have a strong sense that in the First Age of IT all the profits went to IBM, in the Second Age all the profits went to Wintel and thus to Microsoft and Intel, and in the Third Age all the profits went to Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple, Intel, and lately TSMC. I do not have a strong sense about which of these companies’ being there—and other companies—did more to change who we are and how our society works.</p><p>Shouldn’t I have one, this far into the information age?</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/wait-what-what-just-happened-to-facebook/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/wait-what-what-just-happened-to-facebook/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video: On <strong>Claiming That Not Liz Truss But the Bank of England Is the Chaos Monkey Here</strong></h2><p><strong>Gillian Tett</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/Haggis_UK/status/1580281080380211200">Jacob Rees-Mogg is talking bollocks</a>:</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/Haggis_UK/status/1580281080380211200&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Gillian Tett(FT) - Jacob Rees-Mogg is talking bollocks. \n\n<span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>#C4News</span>  &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;Haggis_UK&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Haggis_UK 🇬🇧 🇪🇺&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Wed Oct 12 19:35:44 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/upload/w_1028,c_limit,q_auto:best/l_twitter_play_button_rvaygk,w_88/ipeecdqmbh5gelq3epbe&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/5s9JoX09CY&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:3811,&quot;like_count&quot;:14124,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:&quot;https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1580277608029331464/pu/vid/480x270/hzX_3lUMCHYE1hDi.mp4?tag=12&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/Haggis_UK/status/1580281080380211200" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/Haggis_UK.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @Haggis_UK" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">Haggis_UK 🇬🇧 🇪🇺 </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@Haggis_UK</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">Gillian Tett(FT) - Jacob Rees-Mogg is talking bollocks.

I had one especially aggravating episode a couple of weeks ago, having agreed to speak at a bitcoin conference. After using the verbal filler “like” too much during one particularly combative segment of my panel, I was summarily turned into various memes and video montages that totally clogged up my notifications for about 36 hours. There was the usual name-calling and trolling, but also some nastier than usual tweets and messages calling me the kind of offensive and misogynistic things that I can’t repeat here, and one that suggested I should die by suicide. I was aware that the people attacking me had a huge financial incentive to invalidate my criticisms, so that helped me to not take any of it too seriously. I even found some of the memes funny. But after a while, the sheer weight of negativity began to fill me with gloom about the number of people prepared to be so vile on the internet.… If we want to stop the internet becoming either a desperately bland or perfectly horrible place, we need to start treating it as somewhere we would be happy spending time in real life.

One of the best examinations of the social dynamics of Twitter is an early 2020 blogpost by Venkatesh Rao entitled “<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">The Internet of Beefs</a>.” In the deadpan tone of an anthropologist, Rao describes a sort of feudal society where all interactions are reduced to either displays of solidarity or fights. “Anything that is not an expression of pure, unqualified support for whatever they are doing or saying is received as a mark of disrespect, and a provocation to conflict,” he says of Twitter’s unwritten social code (and, in his argument, that of pretty much the entire public internet). The biggest stars on the platform—e.g., Musk himself—are those who have mastered the art of picking and indefinitely prolonging fights about, well, whatever. The beefing isn’t some unfortunate effect of online life, Rao argues.
