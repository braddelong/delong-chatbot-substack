Robert P Baird: The Invention of Whiteness: The Long History of a Dangerous Idea'. a€~By the time 
The Bell Curve appeared, Du Boisa€™ s assertion that racial categories were
not biologically grounded was widely accepted. In the years since, the scientific evidence for that 
understanding has only become more overwhelming. A 2017 study examined the
DNA of nearly 6,000 people from around the world and found that while that while some genetic 
differences among humans can be traced to various ancestral fineagesa€”for
example, eastern African, southern European or circumpolara€”none of those lineages correspond to 
traditional ideas about racea€!. During the second half of the 20th century a
number  of historians demonstrated thata€! Du Boisa€! was correct that it was only in the modern 
period that people started to think of themselves as belonging to something called
the white race.a€!

Dietz Vollrath: Who Are You Calling Malthusian?: a€~I recently had a student ask me if I was a 
a€oeMalthusiana€na€!. Ita€™ s always asked in a way that implies it is a belief
system, similar to a€oeChristiana€n, a€oeMuslima€D, or aCcePacker Fana€Da€!. Ia€™ m not a 
Malthusian a€oebelievera€D, because that isna€™ t a thing. But I do think that
several of Malthusa€™ assumptions about how economies function, in particular prior to the onset of 
sustained growth during the 1800a€™ s, are well founded. And those
assumptions have implications that help make sense of the worlda€!

W.E.B. Du Bois: The Souls of White Folk: a€~The Middle Age regarded skin color with mild curiosity; 
and even up into the eighteenth century we were hammering our national
manikins into one, great, Universal Man, with fine frenzy which ignored color and race even more 
than birth. Today we have changed all that, and the world in a sudden, emotional
conversion has discovered that it is white and by that token, wonderful! This assumption that of 
all the hues of God whiteness alone is inherently and obviously better than
brownness                                                                                   or tan 
leads to curious acts; even the sweeter souls of the dominant world as they discourse with me on 
weather, weal, and woe are continually playing above their actual
words an obligato of tune and tone, saying a€oeMy poor, un-white thing! Weep not nor rage. I know, 
too well, that the curse of God lies heavy on you. Why? That is not for me to
say, but be brave! Do your work in your lowly sphere, praying the good Lord that into heaven above, 
where all is love, you may, one day, be born-white!a€n I do not laugh. I am
quite straight-faced as I ask soberly: a€oeBut what on earth is whiteness that one should so desire 
it?a€D Then always, somehow, some way, silently but clearly, I am given to
understand that whiteness is the ownership of the earth forever and ever, Amen! Now what is the 
effect on a man or a nation when it comes passionately to believe such an
extraordinary dictum as this?a€!

Economist: The Kremlin Has Isolated Russiaa€™ s Economy: a€~Since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea 
and invaded eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin has commanded the
economy like a fortress under siege, building up reserves, decoupling from the world economy, and 
preparing for the potential impact of Western sanctions or fluctuations in oil
pricesa€!. Russiaa€™ s economy remains highly dependent on hydrocarbons. Despite years of promises, 
no meaningful diversification has taken place. Hydrocarbons still account
for  more than 60% of exportsa€!. Russiaa€™ s covida€“19-related stimulus measures amounted to just 
4% of gdp, according to the World Bank. The pandemic, in Mr Putina€™ s
eyes, is not the proverbial rainy day the nwf was intended fora€!

M.G. Siegler: In(tel) Command: a€~Might Gelsinger pull it offa€!. I finally got around to watching 
the a€oelntel Unleasheda€D presentation from March. While Ia€™m far from
an expert on Intel, like a lot of folks in tech, Ia€™ m fascinateda€!. The good news seems to be 
that new CEO Pat Gelsinger clearly gets this. And perhaps just as importantly, he
clearly cares about this, as someone who worked at Intel for 30 years and has now returned to right 
the ship. And most important still, he seems to have a plan. And to be in
command                                                                                 of the 
situationa€!. GelsingeraC™ sa€! is an actual presentation and not a Q&A. Still, the same thing is 
conveyed: just how in command he is. And perhaps even more so
than Jobs, just how enthusiastic he is about the opportunitya€!

Cosma Shalizi: In Soviet Union, Optimization Problem Solves You: a€~There is a passage in Red 
Plenty which is central to describing both the nightmare from which we are trying
to awake, and vision we are trying to awake into. Henry [Farrell] has quoted it already, but it 
bears repeating:


Marx had drawn a nightmare picture of what happened to human life under capitalism, when everything 
was produced only in order to be exchanged; when

true qualities and uses dropped away, and the human power of making and doing itself became only an 
object to be tradeda€L The motion of society turned
into a kind of zombie dance, a grim cavorting whirl in which objects and people blurred together 
till the objects were half alive and the people were half
dead. Stock-market prices acted back upon the world as if they were independent powers, requiring 
factories to be opened or closed, real human beings to
work or rest, hurry or dawdle; and they, having given the transfusion that made the stock prices 
come alive, felt their flesh go cold and impersonal on them,
mere mechanisms for chunking out the man-hours. Living money and dying humans, metal as tender as 
skin and skin as hard as metal, taking hands, and
dancing round, and round, and round, with no way ever of stopping; the quickened and the deadened, 
whirling on.a€!

And what would be the alternative? The consciously arranged alternative? A dance of another nature, 
Emil presumed. A dance to the music of use, where
every step fulfilled some real need, did some tangible good, and no matter how fast the dancers 
spun, they moved easily, because they moved to a human
measure, intelligible to all, chosen by alla€!

There is a fundamental level at which Marxa€™ s nightmare vision is right: capitalism, the market 
system, whatever you want to call it, is a product of humanity, but each and every
one of us confronts it as an autonomous and deeply alien force. Its ends, to the limited and 
debatable extent that it can even be understood as having them, are simply inhuman. The
ideology of the market tell us that we face not something inhuman but superhuman, tells us to 
embrace our inner zombie cyborg and loose ourselves in the dance. One doesna€™ t
know whether to laugh or cry or running screaming.

But, and this is I think something Marx did not sufficiently appreciate, human beings confront all 
the structures which emerge from our massed interactions in this way. A
bureaucracy, or even a thoroughly democratic polity of which one is a citizen, can feel, can be, 
just as much of a cold monster as the market. We have no choice but to live among
these  alien powers which we create, and to try to direct them to human ends. It is beyond us, it 
is even beyond all of us, to find a€oea human measure, intelligible to all, chosen by
alla€D, which says how everyone should go. What we can do is try to find the specific ways in which 
these powers we have conjured up are hurting us, and use them to check each
other, or deflect them into better paths.

Sometimes this will mean more use of market mechanisms, sometimes it will mean removing some goods 
and services from market allocation, either through public provision or
through other institutional arrangements. Sometimes it will mean expanding the scope of democratic 
decision-making (for instance, into the insides of firms), and sometimes it will
mean narrowing its scope (for instance, not allowing the demos to censor speech it finds 
objectionable). Sometimes it will mean leaving some tasks to experts, deferring to the
internal norms of their professions, and sometimes it will mean recognizing claims of expertise to 
be mere assertions of authority, to be resisted or countered.

These are all going to be complex problems, full of messy compromises. Attaining even second best 
solutions is going to demand a€oebold, persistent experimentation^□,
coupled with a frank recognition that many experiments will just fail, and that even long-settled 
compromises can, with the passage of time, become confining obstacles. We will
not  be able to turn everything over to the wise academicians, or even to their computers, but we 
may, if we are lucky and smart, be able, bit by bit, make a world fit for human
beings to live ina€!

Brad DeLong (1999): An Appalling Article on Graduate Student Unionization by Yale Historian Paul 
Kennedy. I dona€™t know what I find more appalling: The open snobbery
with which Paul Kennedy ridicules the idea that lower-class union leaders and members might have 
something to teach about or some concern over conditions of employment of
graduate studentsa€!. The casual mendacity in his implication that the typical humanities graduate 
student at a private university gets his or her tuition paid and $12,000 a year with
no strings attacheda€!. The sneer at humanities graduate student section leaders at his own 
universitya€’’paid I believe, about $10 an houra€! with little prospects for ever getting a
tenured professorship like Paul Kennedya€™ sa€”for a€oeimagin[ing themselves] as an aggrieved 
member of an exploited academic proletariat.a€Ua€! The claim that the
UAWa€™   s paying its lead organizer at Yale (a more than full-time job) some $10 an hour is an 
extraordinarily generous subsidy that will lead to a a€oenew career track for Ph.D.s
who  find all this campaigning much more exciting than their work on Milton or Freuda€Da€!
