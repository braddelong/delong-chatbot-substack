4.2.3.3. Zoom: Hegemony & Plutocracy :: Econ 135

:: History of Economic Growth

There are, really, two topics this week:

•  The first topic is the phenomenon of hegemony—of a single economy and polity as dominant, at 
least in a
“global leadership” sense, in every age of globalization.

•  We had Spain from 1500 to 1650; we had Britain from 1750 to 1900; we have had America from 1900
(technologically), 1920 (economically and financially) or 1940 (geopolitically) to—how shall I put 
it?—
until           the date certain that is November 8, 2016. And it seems, right now, very likely we 
will have China (or
perhaps India) from 2050 on...

•  The second topic is inequality within societies:

•  The phenomenon of plutocracy, of rule by the extraordinarily wealthy

•  In a way that creates for the extraordinarily wealthy their truly extraordinary wealth, and 
maintains it

•  Plus we want to commence our weekly reviews...

• Spaced repetition...
