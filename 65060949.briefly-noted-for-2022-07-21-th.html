We think that if you raise interest rates, inflation goes down, as it did in the 1980s…. But no, say the Neo-Fisherians, you have to wait for the long term. In the long term, they say, keeping interest rates high will cause inflation at first to dip but then to recover to an even higher level than it was before!… In 2014, I got a call from a reporter in Turkey….

Ronald Reagan… built the neoliberal order; George H. W. Bush extended it; and… Bill Clinton consolidated it…. Sectors of the public called for things… lower property taxes, deregulation, and the privatization of public goods… in a racialized response to the civil rights movement…. Politicians like Reagan mined this discontent to great political effect…. Gobal models… the state-authoritarian capitalist model… neoliberalism retooled… ethno-nationalism….

Did Toba have an effect on human evolution? Somewhere between 100 and 50 thousand years ago, human populations went through a bottleneck: modern humans are descended from just 1,000 to 10,000 breeding pairs from that period. It’s been argued that Toba wiped out the majority of&nbsp;Homo sapiens&nbsp;around at the time, leaving only a small group of survivors. But the evidence that Toba is responsible for the bottleneck is equivocal…. We may not be looking at an external catastrophe wiping out most of humanity, and a few groups of survivors recovering. Instead, we may be looking at a small population of our eventual ancestors expanding and outcompeting other populations, so that it was our ancestors, not a volcano, who made sure that most human beings alive 74,000 years ago didn’t leave descendants…. Human beings typically belong to tribes and ethnic groups defined by distinctive cultures, and cultural boundaries (including language boundaries) often act as barriers to interbreeding.&nbsp;Several authors&nbsp;have&nbsp;suggested that&nbsp;this may make human beings unusually susceptible to population replacement via “cultural group selection” and that this might account for humans having unusually low effective population size, as genes “hitchhike” along with expanding cultures.

They have nothing else to talk about. They must either support themselves in some way independent of their activity as intellectuals, or receive support for their opinions… inherited family wealth, clerking, the learned professions, and teaching. Much of our intellectual heritage has been built by the idle sons of gentlemen, time-serving dynastic bureaucrats, and schoolmasters…. How, though, might intellectuals persuade other people to support them for the sake of their opinions?… “We have in our possession certain books which contain information of the greatest importance…. To order one’s life in accordance with them is certain to bring all good things; flouting them leads to the worst possible misery.” If you believe that, it becomes imperative to have accurate copies of the books around, and somebody who can interpret them and apply them their lessons…. What qualities make for succcess in an Interpreter of Written Authorities?… Literacy… knowledge of the accepted canon… [and] of the tradition of commentary… skill in interpreting writing, particularly knowledge of the exact meanings of words, and sensitivity to their associations, connontations, and subtle shades of import… eloquence… aptitude in applying interpretations to events and situations… and arguing for the correctness of the application… belief: to persuade others, it helps to first persuade yourself…. Such Interpreters naturally tended to organize into more or less formal clerical establishments… at least from the classical eras, about –600 to –200, onwards…. (Incidentally, why a canon?… The inherent implausibility of many books containing the Answers… the limitations of manual book reproduction… network externality.)… This venerable pattern has fallen, comparatively speaking, on hard times…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="http://bactra.org/notebooks/intellectuals.html">http://bactra.org/notebooks/intellectuals.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2022-07-21-th/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2022-07-21-th/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donate Subscriptions&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true"><span>Donate Subscriptions</span></a></p><div class="install-substack-app-embed"><img class="install-substack-app-embed-img" src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png"><div class="install-substack-app-embed-text"><div class="install-substack-app-header">Read Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality in the Substack app</div><div class="install-substack-app-text">Available for iOS and Android</div></div><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_context=author-post-insert" target="_blank" class="install-substack-app-embed-link"><button class="install-substack-app-embed-btn button primary">Get the app</button></a></div><p></p><h6>I greatly enjoy and am, in fact, driven to write Grasping Reality—but its long-term viability and quality do depend on voluntary subscriptions from paying supporters.
