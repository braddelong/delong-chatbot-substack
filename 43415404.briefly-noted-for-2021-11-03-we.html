Buy-and-hold is a good investment strategy for the U.S. stock market. The strategy Hassett and Glassman were pushing—borrow money, leverage up, and go highly long stocks near the peak of a valuation-ratio bubble—led to bankruptcy in 2000 for anyone who acted on the recommendations of <em>Dow 36000</em>. Jason here is much kinder than I would have been:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Jason Zweig</strong>: <em>Dow Crosses 36000—Making a Book’s Prediction Just Two Decades Late</em>: ‘This week, the book “Dow 36,000” by James Glassman and Kevin Hassett turned out to be prophetic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average should hit that mark “very quickly,” “immediately,” even “today,” the book had proclaimed. “The rational time frame is this afternoon,” wrote Messrs. Glassman and Hassett, although they conceded it might take “three to five years.” The book was published Oct. 1, 1999, when the Dow closed at 10273. More than 22 years later, the index very briefly crossed the mark at 9:42 a.m. on Monday, in a moment barely noticed by investors. The book’s prediction finally came true…. On Jan. 17, 2012, with the Dow at 12482 and used copies of “Dow 36,000” selling around that time for as little as one penny, a reviewer using the pseudonym “Annyong Bluth,” a character from the television comedy “Arrested Development,” gave the book a five-star review on Amazon.com. It wasn’t what most people would consider positive, though. “I used the pages of this book to line the base of our two-month-old Rottweiler puppy’s cage,” the reviewer wrote. “I was struck by the moisture and odor-absorbing power of its pages. These super-absorbent sheets really took to canine urine and feces. And, at 1 penny for 294 pages, Dow 36,000 was such a steal! Highly recommended!”… As for “Dow 36,000,” after years of insisting that the book’s thesis was correct, Mr. Glassman finally wrote in an opinion piece in the Journal in February 2011: “I was wrong.” Saying the world had become “a riskier place” since 1999, Mr. Glassman urged investors to scale back their stock holdings. The Dow closed at 12068.50 that day. Since then, the Dow has tripled…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dow-jones-36000-stock-market-predictions-glassman-hassett-11634823650">https://www.wsj.com/articles/dow-jones-36000-stock-market-predictions-glassman-hassett-11634823650</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>What is Kevin Hassett saying today, on Dow 36,000 day? In my inbox:</p><blockquote><p>In a wide-ranging interview with&nbsp;_Washington Post Live_&nbsp;today,&nbsp;author Kevin Hassett&nbsp;discussed his warning that high inflation will drive the U.S. economy into a recession and his new book,&nbsp;<em>The Drift: Stopping America’s Slide Toward Socialism</em>. Hassett is a former senior adviser and chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Donald Trump…. ‘The fact is that socialism doesn’t work’:&nbsp;“The fact is that socialism doesn’t work. And when you pursue strategies other than profit maximization, then you don’t maximize productivity, you don’t maximize wages… Even the Scandinavians when they move to the U.S., their standard of living skyrockets.” Hassett says income inequality ‘dropped sharply’ while President Trump was in office:&nbsp;“Donald Trump comes in and pursues very capitalist policies… and those policies had a massive positive effect on ‘social justice.’ You know, the number of people living in poverty dropped by six million… Income inequality skyrocketed before President Trump came to office, and dropped sharply when he was in office.” Hassett on how to help the middle class:&nbsp;“I think the best way to help the middle class is the way we did it during the Trump administration which is to encourage businesses to expand, to cut corporate taxes so that there’s a big increase in capital formation, that increases productivity, that drives wages up…</p></blockquote><p>Hassett knows that there was no big increase in capital formation after the Trump-Ryan-McConnell corporate income tax cut he helped design. The big increases in capital formation came (a) under Clinton due to smart policies, and (b) under Obama as the economy recovered from the Great Recession that grew out of policies and circumstances that took place on George W. Bush’s watch. The red arrow shows the effect on capital formation of Trump-Ryan-McConnell: none. Hassett knows that. But his Washington Post Live interviewers didn’t know and didn’t care to learn:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4458bed-f949-4d81-bac6-64b0b997cbe0_1962x1368.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4458bed-f949-4d81-bac6-64b0b997cbe0_1962x1368.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4458bed-f949-4d81-bac6-64b0b997cbe0_1962x1368.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4458bed-f949-4d81-bac6-64b0b997cbe0_1962x1368.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4458bed-f949-4d81-bac6-64b0b997cbe0_1962x1368.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b4458bed-f949-4d81-bac6-64b0b997cbe0_1962x1368.png" width="1456" height="1015" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b4458bed-f949-4d81-bac6-64b0b997cbe0_1962x1368.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1015,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:240223,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4458bed-f949-4d81-bac6-64b0b997cbe0_1962x1368.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4458bed-f949-4d81-bac6-64b0b997cbe0_1962x1368.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4458bed-f949-4d81-bac6-64b0b997cbe0_1962x1368.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4458bed-f949-4d81-bac6-64b0b997cbe0_1962x1368.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>It is, admittedly, an accomplishment to give corporations as large a tax cut as the one Hassett helped design without managing to give them incentives to increase capital formation.

They had… very high Hirschman levels…. But after many years of spectacular growth driven by capital deepening (in large part restoring the infrastructure and manufacturing capacity that had been wrecked by war), each of these countries reached that point again, after which their growth rates slowed rapidly. Their actual levels of investment had “caught up” not to the capital frontier set by the United States but rather to the Hirschman levels consistent with their own domestic institutions. The same has been true of China. When the reform era began in the late 1970s, the country had emerged from five decades of anti-Japanese war, civil war, and Maoism that had left it terribly underinvested—relative not to the capital frontier set by the United States, but rather, more meaningfully, to a Hirschman level of investment that its own institutions allowed it to absorb productively…. In China’s case, the fastest way to develop in the 1980s and 1990s was to increase capital deepening as rapidly as possible. But… it was always just a matter of time before it reached its own Hirschman level…. Being further behind economically does not increase the probability of catch-up except in specific cases, usually in cases where, for historical reasons (like war, revolution, political circumstances, or incompetence), a country’s level of investment has fallen far behind its Hirschman level, which is itself determined by the development level of the country’s institutions. The so-called middle income trap is, in my opinion, a recognition of this fact…. What China really needs is a transformation of its institutions in a direction that some might argue is very different from the direction it is currently following…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/82362">https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/82362</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Don Kalb</strong>: <em>HAU Not: For David Graeber &amp; the Anthropological Precariate</em>: ‘I told my students that O[pen ]A[ccess] in academia might perhaps be a possibility, but… more likely… endless exploitation of precarious academics on every level.
