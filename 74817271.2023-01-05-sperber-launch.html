It is a work of massive intelligence and erudition, beautifully rendered in eloquent and moving prose. Sperber really shows how interconnections work, and how apparently unrelated trends or events fit in with each other. A must-read for anyone interested in global order, and in the precarious legacy the twentieth century left for the new millennium." - <strong>Harold James, author </strong><em><strong>The War of Words: A Glossary of Globalization</strong></em></p><p>"A preeminent historian of the nineteenth century has turned his attention to the second half of the twentieth, with spectacular results. Jonathan Sperber tackles the largest and most important themes head-on, with intellectual energy and a remarkable command of telling detail. <em>The Age of Interconnection</em> is bold, original, imaginatively organized, and exceptionally well written. This is a deeply serious book that is also exciting to read, a true <em>tour de force</em>." - <strong>David Blackbourn, author of </strong><em><strong>The Conquest of Nature</strong></em><strong> and the forthcoming </strong><em><strong>Germany in the World, 1500-2000: A Global History</strong></em></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>
