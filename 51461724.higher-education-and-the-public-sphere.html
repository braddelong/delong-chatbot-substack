Bérubé and Ruth were motivated by the Trump years and the George Floyd protests to reconsider their previous views on free speech and academic freedom…. [That] the two things are identical… doesn’t survive contact with the case of James Tracy… who loudly promoted the conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a false flag, and took to harassing the victims’ parents… [claiming] academic freedom has nothing at all to do with free speech… academics should be protected [only] when they are commenting on their area of specific expertise…. doesn’t work either…. </p><p>Bérubé and Ruth argue that the way to think… is by judging comments… by whether they cast doubt on a professor’s fitness to participate in intellectual life. Academic freedom should protect professors’ ability to say controversial things and start hard discussions, but it comes with an equally important responsibility that those statements be grounded in serious thought and research—and in reality…. Ulrich Baer… argues that… “speech that proposes that some humans are innately inferior to others, and thus undermines the baseline assumption of human equality… degenerates into an exercise in domination.”… This… sounds like censorship, and… it is. But… there are dozens of ideas that are de facto banned from the academy: flat earth theory, geocentrism, phlogiston… “the Jews had it coming,” “vaccines cause autism,” “climate change is a hoax,” and “phrenology has much to teach us.”… </p><p>Free speech and free discussion are public goods that require regulation to preserve just like any other kind of public good…. The most widely applicable part of the book is a more general consideration of free speech itself…. It is simply naïve to think that argument will convince people intent on leveraging liberal tolerance to seize power and murder their political opponents…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://prospect.org/culture/books/cure-for-hate-speech-is-not-more-speech-berube-ruth-review/">https://prospect.org/culture/books/cure-for-hate-speech-is-not-more-speech-berube-ruth-review/</a>&gt;<br>LINK: <strong>Michael Bérubé &amp; Jennifer Ruth</strong>: <em>It’s Not Free Speech: Race, Democracy, and the Future of Academic Freedom</em>: ‘When a professor’s intramural or extramural speech calls into question his or her fitness to serve… how to manage the simmering tension between the academic freedom of faculty and the antidiscrimination initiatives of campus offices of diversity, equity, and inclusion… &lt;<a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781421443874">https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781421443874</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Modern societies have, among their most important parts, the <em><strong>fiduciary institution</strong></em> or science, the <em><strong>mercenary institution</strong></em> of the commodity market economy, and the institutions of the public sphere and higher education:</p><p>One excellence of the <em><strong>fiduciary institution</strong></em> of science is that, by assigning judgment to peer review by the community of those who seek to become masters of knowledge, it provides a sieve for distinguishing discovery from error. A second excellence of science is that by assigning priority and hence status to the first discoverer, it incentives both hard work and the creation of knowledge and the most rapid possible dissemination of that knowledge so that others can then build upon it. Thus the <em><strong>fiduciary institution</strong></em> of science solves the societal problem of incentivizing and then disseminating true and valid discovery. This <em><strong>fiduciary institution</strong></em> goes wrong when the peers who are doing the reviewing do not seek above all to become masters of knowledge—do not prioritize the judgments of nature and experiment above all else—and are in an <em><strong>absorbing state</strong></em>, where results that reinforce their prejudices are seized upon and those who generate such results are promoted, and results that contradict their prejudices are dismissed and those who generate such results dismissed as well. But as long as there is a continuous infusion of young who at least start out wanting to become masters of knowledge and believing in listening to nature and experiment, science progresses—if only funeral by funeral.</p><p>One excellence of private property is that by assigning “ownership” it has the potential to push decision-making power out from the ignorance center to the periphery where the information actually is and people understand the situation. One excellence of market exchange is that the prices it produces and disseminates serve as very good signals of the intensity of need for production and transport (or, rather, of the intensity of need times the wealth of those who have the money—for those who do not have the money are invisible to the market). A second excellence is that the act of exchanging a commodity for a price greatly incentivizes the production and transport of commodities the market has judged as valuable. A third excellence is that the market equilibrium coordinates: those whose opportunity-cost to produce or transport is less than the market price do so, those whose willingness-to-pay—that is, their intensity of desire times their wealth—is greater than the market price utilize, and the two are balanced. Thus the <em><strong>mercenary institution</strong></em> of the commodity market—private property and market exchange—solves the societal problems of information, incentivization, and coordination with respect to the production, transport, and distribution of commodities. This <em><strong>mercenary institution</strong></em> goes wrong (a) where there are externalities—where third parties are affected so that market-exchanges are not win-win-win—and (b) where the distribution of wealth is not in accord with the values in the true societal well-being function.</p><p>Suppose one were to attempt a similar analysis of the institutions of the public sphere and of higher education. What would it look like? I am not sure. But I think that Bérubé and Ruth may have just given us a very good starting place.</p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/higher-education-and-the-public-sphere?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/higher-education-and-the-public-sphere?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Brad DeLong</strong>: <em>‘Matthew Yglesias points to the problem of Bob Woodward</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.bradford-delong.com/2006/09/why_oh_why_cant_26.html">https://www.bradford-delong.com/2006/09/why_oh_why_cant_26.html</a>&gt; </p></li><li><p><strong>Ben Thompson</strong>: <em>The Current Thing</em>: ‘A world where the ability for anyone to post any idea has, paradoxically, meant far greater mass adoption of popular ideas and far more effective suppression of “bad” ideas… &lt;<a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/the-current-thing/">https://stratechery.com/2022/the-current-thing/</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Scott M.</strong> (March 16, 2003): <em>Nestor Makhno &amp; Me</em>: ‘Getting rid of Makhno was one of the better things the Bolsheviks did… &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100717144259/http://pedantry.blogspot.com/2003_03_16_pedantry_archive.html#90784783">https://web.archive.org/web/20100717144259/http://pedantry.blogspot.com/2003_03_16_pedantry_archive.html#90784783</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Stephen Broadberry &amp; Mark Harrison</strong>: <em>The Economics of the Second World War: Seventy-Five Years on</em>&lt;<a href="https://voxeu.org/article/economics-second-world-war-seventy-five-years-new-ebook">https://voxeu.org/article/economics-second-world-war-seventy-five-years-new-ebook</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>David Stockman</strong>: <em>Author at Antiwar.com</em>: ‘Pearl Harbor My Eye!: We were already getting sick and tired of this Zelensky clown, but the sheer chutzpah of comparing Ukraine’s predicament with Pearl Harbor or 9/11… &lt;<a href="https://original.antiwar.com/author/David_Stockman/">https://original.antiwar.com/author/David_Stockman/</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Annotations by Molly White &amp; </strong><em><strong>al.</strong></em>: <em>The Edited Latecomer’s Guide to Crypto</em>: ‘On March 20, 2022, the New York Times published a 14,000-word puff piece on cryptocurrencies… [by] Kevin Roose… &lt;<a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/annotations/latecomers-guide-to-crypto">https://www.mollywhite.net/annotations/latecomers-guide-to-crypto</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="https://www.bradford-delong.com/2006/09/why_oh_why_cant_26.html">https://www.bradford-delong.com/2006/09/why_oh_why_cant_26.html</a>&gt;</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>Twitter &amp; ‘Stack:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Aaron Rupar</strong>: <em>I spent all weekend being a punching bag for Trumpers.

For one thing, it is not impossible to hold a position other than the dominant one—for what is the dominant position depends very much on one’s own social network. But it is the case that, for nearly everyone, their internet-enabled social network will have a strongly dominant position, the authority of which is rarely worth resisting, and resisting which can rapidly become very painful. I will have to think much more about this:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ben Thompson</strong>: <em>The Current Thing</em>: ‘Aggregation Theory… the explosion of content on the Internet: the first order implication is… that there are far more categories of thought than ever before! And, if you dig deep enough into the Internet, this is true. Most people, though, don’t dig that deep, just as they don’t dig that deep for content or contacts or commerce: it’s just far easier and more convenient to rely on Google or Facebook or Amazon. Why wouldn’t this same dynamic apply to ideas?… We all outsource our intuition for what events matter, and what our position on those events should be, to the most convenient option, especially if that option has obvious moral valence. Police brutality against people of color is obviously bad; people dying from COVID is obviously bad; Russia invading Ukraine is obviously bad; why wouldn’t each of us snap into opposition to obviously bad things?… Sure, the Internet makes possible a wide range of viewpoints—you can absolutely find critics of Black Lives Matter, COVID policies, or pro-Ukraine policies—but the Internet, thanks to its lack of friction and instant feedback loops, also makes nearly every position but the dominant one untenable. If everyone believes one thing, the costs of believing something else increase dramatically, making the consensus opinion the only viable option; this is the same dynamic in which publishers become dependent on Google or Facebook, or retailers on Amazon, just because that is where money can be made. Again, to be very clear, that does not mean the opinion is wrong…. The more that an entity becomes dependent on an Aggregator, the more perilous the economic outlook for said entity. If you depend on Google or Facebook for traffic, or Amazon for sales, the more liable you are to have your margin consumed by said entities. A truly sustainable business model depends on being able to connect to your customers on your own terms, not an Aggregator’s. A similar critique can be made of ideas…. A world where the ability for anyone to post any idea has, paradoxically, meant far greater mass adoption of popular ideas and far more effective suppression of “bad” ideas…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/the-current-thing/">https://stratechery.com/2022/the-current-thing/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>This is the David Stockman who was once Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s babysitter, and Reagan’s budget director.

At least these are coherent narratives: Antonov Airport, supply convoy, Irpin (urban defense)-Vyshhorod (urban defense)-Makariv (ambush). Troop strength numbers seem to me to be simply guesses:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tomi T. Ahonen</strong>: <em>’The Battle of Kyiv</em> was decisive battle in Ukraine War that Russia launced invading on Feb 24, 2022. Russian assault on Kyiv was catastrophic military failure, overwhelming victory for Ukraine. Because of Social Media, we have a unique ability to reconstruct history in near-real time, to know EXACTLY what happened and WHEN. And sort out the lies, propaganda and ‘fog of war’. Not WHILE it happens, but very shortly thereafter. During the battle we cannot know WHICH of the social media postings is accurate, even to the best honest efforts of those posting (because it could have been misunderstanding or a deliberate military diversion, intended to get attention). But after a battle, we can see what had actually happened, who won, who lost. Where the battle was fought. And we can tell quite well, which parts of the original postings were ACCURATE—and then collect the best TRUE history of what happened.</p><p>This is SIGNIFICANTLY better than reading or viewing the BEST news sources that were CONTEMPORARY because those were always subject to the same current analysis errors. Not knowing the big picture and the full story. Now we know.</p><p>We know NOW that yes, Putin had a 4 hours plan to win the war in Ukraine. And his ‘Plan B’ was a 3 days plan to defeat Kyiv if the 4 hours plan somehow failed. He deployed both of these plans with MASSIVE military force, against Kyiv. We now know how:</p><p>FOUR HOUR PLAN: Yes. There was a plan to defeat Ukraine in ‘four hours’. It could have worked. Russia (=Soviet Union) used this in Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia (1968) and Afghanistan (1979). Seize the capital, take the TV/radio, &amp; declare on TV you won. Putin plan to defeat Ukraine in 4 hours involved an air assault force of 1,000 men taking Antonov Airport at Hostomel, then IL 76 transport planes would land 7,000 men and their armored vehicles, to take the Presidential Palace (&amp; TV stations) in Kyiv. This bold plan to defeat Ukraine in 4 hours might have worked. Russia had done that before when toppling a government. About 30 Mil 17 transport helicopters and their escort helicopters attacked at dawn of Feb 24 &amp; assaulted Antonov Airport.</p><p>BATTLE OF ANTONOV AIRPORT: The first battle of the Ukraine War and first battle in the Battle for Kyiv was the Battle of Antonov Airport, 24–25 Feb 2022. Initial assault force arrived at dawn in about 30 Mil 17 helicopters &amp; their attack helicopters. The assault force had airborne troops from either 11th or 35th Guards Air Assault Brigade. Some of their helicopters were shot down. The remaining force of about 1,000 elite paratroop units faced Ukraine’s 3rd Special Purpose Regiment waiting to defend. While this battle for the airport was under way, the main air assault force (7,000 more men &amp; their armored vehicles) arrived over the airport in giant IL 76 transport cargo jets. They attempted to land. Ukraine shot down two IL 76. Landing was aborted. The IL 76 jets were diverted to nearest Russian-controlled airfield which was on the Belarus side of the border, town of Gomel (Homel).</p><p>Meanwhile Ukraine’s Kyiv defense sent 4th Rapid Reaction Brigade to reinforce the defenders who retook the airport. Antonov Airport, briefly in Russian hands in the morning of Feb 24, was now back in Ukrainian control by afternoon of Feb 24. They knew a large land invasion army was coming South from Belarus, and proceeded to destroy the runways of this airport. The Russian paratroops attacked Antonov Airport in a massive helicopter assault of 200 helicopters and about 5,000 men, taking the airport again, on Feb 25. But Ukraine defenders prevented their breakout encircling the airport.</p><p>The main army attacking Kyiv came overland with tanks and armor, the 35th Combined Arms Army. It fought itself to and through the perimeter of the Antonov airport &amp; afternoon Feb 25 airport was in Russian hands. But now unusable so was pyrrhic victory. If you remember early hysteria that Kyiv might fall, or President Zelensky might be captured or killed, &amp; Western allies begged Zelensky to flee Kyiv. This was all realistic &amp; the threat was real. Russians TRIED an air assault on Kyiv. Putin Plan A was to defeat Ukraine in 4 hours. He launched a massive air assault with 8,000 elite paratroops, their armored vehicles, dozens of helicopters &amp; dozens of giant cargo planes &amp; DID seize the airport suitable for this mission.</p><p>Plan A failed</p><p>PLAN B—ENCIRCLE KYIV: While Plan A was under way, ALSO Russia had prepared for Plan B, just in case. On same morning Feb 24, they launched the full assault on Kyiv, to take the capital city by force. And this plan was modeled on Grozny, Chechen War. In Putin’s first war (then as Prime Minister) the Second Chechen War 1999–2000, Putin encircled capital city of Chechnya, Grozny (pop 450,000). Laid a minefield around it. Bombarded it every day &amp; night until literally every building destroyed. This EXACT same Grozny battle plan is used by Putin today in Ukraine, in siege of Mariupol (pop 450,000). To undestand Plan B for Kyiv, look at Mariupol. That was Putin’s Plan B for Kyiv (pop 3M). Not invade Kyiv but encircle it &amp; then bombard to rubble.</p><p>BATTLE OF KYIV: The Battle plan to take Kyiv was to send Russian 35th Combined Arms Army from Belarus to a staging town outside Kyiv (Hostomel just outside of Irpin) on Day 1. Then refuel. Then encircle Kyiv on Day 2. Start destruction of Kyiv on Day 3. Note, the Russians did not expect that Kyiv would capitulate after 3 days, only that in this battle plan, they would encircle Kyiv in 3 days, essentially guaranteeing Russia’s eventually destruction of Kyiv (six months to two years later) or surrender. The Battle of Kyiv plan needed only one significant element to work. The refueling of their tanks, armored vehicles &amp; self-propelled artillery. The distance from Belarus border to Kyiv is EXACTLY the maximum fuel they could carry. Needed refueling.</p><p>If refueled after one day this 35th Combined Arms Army (that I estimated was roughly 70,000 men, 7,000 armored vehicles incl 2,100 tanks) would have enough fuel to complete the encirclement of Kyiv on Day 2, so to lay siege on Kyiv from 26th of February. Part 1 of this plan worked exactly as planned. The tanks crossed border into Ukraine on 24 February. By 25th February they had reached Hostomel, 13 miles (20km) from Kyiv. But they were out of fuel. They came to their designated refueling area.. Their promised fuel had not yet arrived. So they waited. They called up the convoy where that precious fuel was, and found out, the fuel trucks are less than an hour away. So they waited. And called an hour later. Delay. Four hours later. Still delayed. At some point the commander of 35th Combined Arms Army decided to postpone refueling to next day, told his troops to get some sleep. And called up his fuel trucks. They were still delayed, just 1 hour out, facing local resistance, it is a narrow road.</p><p>The 70,000 men and 7,000 armored vehicles attacked from Belarus border, crossed 70 miles (115km) &amp; reached their Day 1 target on schedule Had the fuel been there this army would have encircled Kyiv on Day 2. Something prevented that. The 40 mile convoy</p><p>BATTLE OF 40 MILE CONVOY: Had Russia figured out, on Feb 25, that this convoy of the fuel they needed, would never arrive, they would have ordered a replacement convoy, &amp; received full fuel (and food and ammo) no later than Feb 28.</p><p>Ukraine tricked them.</p><p>With what would become known as ‘the 40 mile convoy’, the Ukrainian defenders of Kyiv, managed to play a cat-and-mouse game with gullible Russian commanders, to believe for TWO WEEKS that this convoy might reach the starved troops &amp; tanks.</p><p>We now know, that the initial delays to 40 mile convoy were done by a specialist forest combat unit of only 30 commandos, led by Ukrainian Col Yaroslav Honchar. They used quad bikes to move fast in the swampy forest. They had night vision gear &amp; drones. The Ukrainian unit did what any convoy combat needs, they disabled (or destroyed) the first 3 vehicles at a narrow point on the road. It blocked passage forward. Then harassed the convoy as it grew longer and more congested. Fast hit-and-run attacks. At some point (I do not yet know when or where) at least one bridge, possibly several bridges were destroyed preventing the extremely heavy cargo trucks from passing over modest water obstacles. So Russians brought bridging gear, delay delay delay. The convoy that kept growing, to its full length of 40 miles (64 km) had eventually about 1,400 supply trucks jammed on this narrow road. They had a small security detail of about 2,000 Russian soldiers. And were never able to break through Ukrainians.</p><p>The Russian command did not figure out how Ukraine was playing them until about March 11. And Russia sent several smaller replacement convoys on other roads, that reached the Russian 35th Combined Arms Army around 14 March. This delay saved Kyiv.</p><p>BATTLE OF IRPIN: While the armored vehicles were without fuel and could not maneuver, the 35th Combined Arms Army did not sit idly. They would need to move from the planned encirclement inwards in any case, to get good artillery positions to shell Kyiv.</p><p>So just a few miles from Hostomel towards Kyiv, is the next town on the suburbs of Kyiv, named Irpin (pop 30,000). The battle for Irpin would be the turning point in the Battle of Kyiv. It lasted one month. The Russian 35th Combined Arms Army arrived to edge of Irpin on 25th February. The assault on Irpin started on 27th Feb. The Ukrainians were there, ready, &amp; determined to hold. This was test of unstoppable force vs immovable object. One month of combat.</p><p>Irpin is 11 miles (17km) from Kyiv. Russia never took Irpin. This was how close the massive invasion army of Russia got to Kyiv. 11 miles. Here is where Ukraine turned them back. On 28 March, Ukrainians had kicked all Russians out, and liberated Irpin.</p><p>THE SIEGE OF KYIV: The 3 Day War Plan to defeat Ukraine involved encircling Kyiv. Day 1 of that encirclement plan went exactly according to plan &amp; schedule. But the required fuel did not arrive to move forward on Day 2. So the Russian armor had to wait. The mighty 35th Combined Arms Army of Russia, with about 70,000 men, 7,000 armored vehicles, that crossed 70 miles (115km) in 24 hours, would have easily covered the two pincers the next 24 hours to encircle Kyiv, each only 20 miles (32km) of distance. But once the Ukrainians knew where the Russians were, and saw exactly the force there, on satellite photos and drone video, Ukrainians built the required defenses to stop this force from encircling Kyiv. There were only 2 directions to go from Hostomel. Ukrainians knew, that heading West from Hostomel comes the Dnepro (Dnieper) river. Last town before the river is Vyshhorod. And next town East was Makariv. So the Ukrainians knew where Russia would go, once it was refueled.</p><p>The Ukrainians saw on satellite images when the Russians finally figured out their cat-and-mouse game with the 40 mile convoy, when Russia finally sent replacement convoys on other routes. Ukraine shelled those too, but most got through. By March 16 the Russians had finally been able to refuel their armor stuck in Hostomel. And what remained of 70,000 men after 3 weeks of combat, could finally start the total encirclement of Kyiv. This would turn into an utter disaster.</p><p>Towards the West the Ukrainians had urban combat defenses in the suburb of Vyshhorod now as heavily defended as Irpin. The Russians never got even a foothold in Vyshhorod. They had waited too long. But they also attacked East. Because Ukraine knew, the path West was impassable, this 35th Combined Arms Army was forced to go East to encircle Kyiv, they were waiting in ambush near town Makariv.</p><p>While battle in Irpin lasted a month in man-to-man urban combat, the armored units of the Russian 35th Combined Arms Army clashed with Ukrainian armor &amp; anti-tank units in ambush, outside Makariv &amp; lasted only two days. Makariv was liberated on 22 March. In the Battle outside Makariv Ukraine was able to hit the command post of the total 35th Combined Arms Army reportedly wounding the commander of the Northern invasion army (was listed early as one of Generals killed but seems to be alive). With the armor destroyed outside Makariv and much of the infantry wiped out in the urban combat meat grinder attempting to move into Irpin, the 35th Combined Arms Army had probably half in casualties (dead or injured). The assault on Kyiv had now failed.</p><p>The remnants of the Russian 35th Combined Arms Army retreated out of Ukraine, back to Belarus on 31 March. Those that were able to escape did. At least 700 vehicles got out, could be 10,000 men, partly injured. The Battle of Kyiv was now won by Ukraine.</p><p>Putin sent an airborne assault army, the size of one division, 8,000 men to go take an airport (by helicopter assault) and then fly the division in my cargo planes, to take the Presidential Palace &amp; broadcast on Ukrainian TV that Ukraine had surrendered.</p><p>Putin’s backup plan, if the 4 hour war would fail, was the 3 day war to encircle Kyiv. After the air assault was repelled by Ukraine’s brave resistance at Antonov Airport in Hostomel, the massive Russian army arrived to the edge of Kyiv to lay siege. From Feb 25 the Russian army was at the gates of Kyiv, yet Ukrainians turned a huge army into a paper tiger and humiliated the Russians so badly, they turned and ran back to Belarus on 31 March</p><p>The Battle of Kyiv is an enormous victory for Ukraine</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/tomiahonen/status/1510276654945509379&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Battle of Kyiv Thread 12/\n\nWhile this battle for the airport was under way, the main air assault force (7,000 more men &amp;amp; their armored vehicles) arrived over the airport in giant IL 76 transport cargo jets.

I have a few minor objections to it based on what is missing. Ukrainian leadership &amp; Russian corruption thread.</p><p>The 1st missing piece is the Pres. Zelensky statement to the West “I need ammunition, not a ride.” “The moral is to the physical what ten is to one”—Napoléon Bonaparte of France. This political act that set the table for the defeat of the Russian VDV outside Kyiv. It prepared the Ukrainian Army for a fight to the death at Kyiv and in a sentence gave the Ukrainian people a rallying cry.</p><p>The 2nd thing left out was a military decision by Pres. Zelensky that defeated the 3-day plan to encircle Kyiv. Zelensky ordered the approaches to be Kyiv flooded. It was this act that set the table for Ukrainian Aerorozvidka weaponized commercial drones to block the bottlenecked by flooding road supply line to the 70,000 Russian troops sitting out of fuel North West of Kyiv.</p><p>The last objection is explaining how the Ukrainians could “play games” with Russian communications. This involved the failure in by corruption of the Russian Azart digital spread spectrum software defined radio. “Azart proved less capable than expected under combat conditions because there were not enough of them and these radios were unable to remain in contact with higher headquarters. In combat Russian support forces are supposed to erect temporary repeater towers or employ vehicles carrying mobile towers so that Azart users on the front line could stay in touch with other units and the chain of command that went all the way back to the Stavka (Great Staff) in Moscow that controlled all military operations. The repeater towers did not work because armed Ukrainians found and destroyed them.”</p><p>And a little later at the same link: “The Ukrainians know all about Azart because soon after Russian troops began receiving them in 2017, many also showed up on the black market, where anyone could buy one. The Ukrainians did so and, along with NATO, discovered what Azart could do and what its weaknesses were. Ukrainian and NATO tech experts concluded that, with proper countermeasures, the Azart radios would become a major liability for Russian commanders and it was.”</p><p>This “failure by corruption” of the Azart radios enabled Ukraine to counterfeit “The Fuel convoy is coming” messages that took quite some time for the Russian Army HQ to pick up on. This was aided greatly by capturing the Azart radio gear frequency, password &amp; encryption setting documents of the 1st VDV assault on the Antonov facility.</p><p>Zelensky’s leadership &amp; Russian corruption (including tires as well as radios!), plus the blood of Ukrainian Patriots beat all of Putin’s plans…</p><p>LINK: &lt;</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/TrentTelenko/status/1510745445940842500&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;It was this act that set the table for Ukrainian Aerorozvidka weaponized commercial drones to block the bottlenecked by flooding road supply line to the 70,000 Russian troops sitting out of fuel North West of Kyiv.\n\n<a class=\&quot;tweet-url\&quot; href=\&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/elite-ukrainian-drone-unit-on-quad-bikes-ambushed-russian-forces-the-guardian-2022-4\&quot;>businessinsider.com/elite-ukrainia…</a>\n5/&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;TrentTelenko&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Trent Telenko&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sun Apr 03 22:25:57 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:71,&quot;like_count&quot;:597,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/elite-ukrainian-drone-unit-on-quad-bikes-ambushed-russian-forces-the-guardian-2022-4&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f3534409-977a-49e5-a9d3-de1fd6bd7174_1200x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;An elite Ukrainian drone unit on quad bikes ambushed Russian forces, helping to defeat Putin’s plan to capture Kyiv, report says&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Aerorozvidka is an elite drone unit set up by tech-savvy young Ukrainians that used quad bikes under the cover of night to ambush Russian columns.&quot;,&quot;domain&quot;:&quot;businessinsider.com&quot;},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/TrentTelenko/status/1510745445940842500" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/TrentTelenko.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @TrentTelenko" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">Trent Telenko </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@TrentTelenko</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">It was this act that set the table for Ukrainian Aerorozvidka weaponized commercial drones to block the bottlenecked by flooding road supply line to the 70,000 Russian troops sitting out of fuel North West of Kyiv.

Russian air forces at Melitopol are now in AFU long range rocket artillery attack range via BM–30 Smersh &amp; Toshka-U now on the north shore of the Dneiper. The major Ukrainian airbase at Melitopol was the former hub for Ukrainian Il–76MD CANDID operations. It is now used as a FOB for Russian helos &amp; Su–25’s. The AFU is now making public comparisons to the RuAF experience with Smersh &amp; Toshka-U at Chornobaivka AB near Kherson.</p><p>Now the predictions: Right now Ukrainian Aerorozvidka ATV &amp; Drone teams &amp; a lot of ATGM’s are being infiltrated across the Dnieper river at night to besiege Kherson &amp; scout Melitopol with Ukrainian SF stay behind teams &amp; Territorial defense forces. And what I mean by the Aerorozvidka “scouting” is they are flying their DJI drones, landing them on isolated stretches of road the Territorial Defense ‘road watchers’ tell them are frequented by Russian supply trucks, &amp; are then generating digital target reference points for long range rocket artillery &amp; local mortars. The latter are being infiltrated across the Dnieper with the ATGM’s.</p><p>These rocket &amp; mortar TRP will supplement Ukrainian convoy kill teams awaiting big game. The repetition of the RuAF experience at Chornobaivka AB will eventually cause a similar Melitopol AB bug out. The big game the Aerorozvidka are waiting for are the RuAF mechanics, tool &amp; spare parts in the trucks leaving the Melitopol AB. With those gone the RuAF loses the ability to generate enough air interdiction sorties in the South to stop a AFU general offensive by its mobile mechanized brigades crossing the Dnieper. This will force Russian ground forces out of their fortified positions to deal with the Ukrainian mobile formations.</p><p>Then the real trap will be spring.</p><p>You see, the real Ukrainian killing force isn’t their mobile brigades. It is the light infantry ATGM &amp; Drone supported mortar teams who are listening to compromised Russian radios. A lot of these ATGM &amp; Drone “Fire sack” ambushes will be at night to minimize Ukrainian casualties due to the lack of Russian night vision devices &amp; aircraft PGM’s. Given the Ukrainian penetration of Russian Azart radios, Russian mechanized units will be slow, clumsy &amp; brittle in Southern Ukrainian mobile operations. If the Ukrainians play their cards right. This is the recipe for a Russian Army general collapse &amp; rout to Crimea.</p><p>The reason I’m laying this out ahead of time is due to the fact the Russians are helpless to stop it. The only counter to light infantry the way the Ukrainians are using it is more Russian air mobile light infantry in helicopters. The Russian name for that is the VDV. Which was p–sed away trying to take Kyiv. And even if the Russians placed VDV remnants into helicopters in the South, they would still have no reliable radios. While Ukrainian light infantry has Stinger, Starstreak &amp; Aerorozvidka Drones.</p><p>Schadenfreude is a b—h and her stripper name is Karma.</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/TrentTelenko/status/1511108357712719872&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;This is a near term, course of the Ukrainian War, prediction thread🧵\n\nRussian air forces at Melitopol are now in AFU long range rocket artillery attack range via BM-30 Smersh &amp;amp; Toshka-U now on the north shore of the Dneiper.\n1/\n<a class=\&quot;tweet-url\&quot; href=\&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BM-30_Smerch\&quot;>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BM-30_Sme…</a>&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;TrentTelenko&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Trent Telenko&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Mon Apr 04 22:28:02 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:85,&quot;like_count&quot;:273,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BM-30_Smerch&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/19ea7535-26c9-4268-92c9-032df9d1475b_1200x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;BM-30 Smerch - Wikipedia&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:null,&quot;domain&quot;:&quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot;},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/TrentTelenko/status/1511108357712719872" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/TrentTelenko.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @TrentTelenko" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">Trent Telenko </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@TrentTelenko</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">This is a near term, course of the Ukrainian War, prediction thread🧵
