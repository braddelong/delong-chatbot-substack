Finding the best ways to do good.

a€oeThe 140 years from 1870 to 2010 of the long twentieth century were, I strongly believe, the 
most consequential years of all humanitya€™ s centuries.a€D

So argues Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History o f the Twentieth Century, the new magnum 
opus from UC Berkeley professor Brad DeLong. Ita€™ s a bold claim. Homo sapiens has been around for 
at least 300,000 years; the a€oelong twentieth centurya€D represents 0.05 percent of that history.

But to DeLong, who beyond his academic work is known for his widely read blog on economics, 
something incredible happened in that sliver of time that eluded our species for the other 99.95 
percent of our history. Whereas before 1870, technological progress proceeded slowly, if at all, 
after 1870 it accelerated dramatically. And especially for residents of rich countries, this 
technological progress brought a world of unprecedented plenty.
DeLong reports that in 1870, an average unskilled male worker living in London could afford 5,000 
calories for himself and his family on his daily wages. That was more than the 3,000 calories he 
coulda€™ ve afforded in 1600, a 66 percent increase a€” progress, to be sure. But by 2010, the same 
worker could afford 2.4 million calories a day, a nearly five hundred foldincrease.

DeLonga€™ s book is called Slouching Towards Utopia, though, not Achieving Utopia. The 
unprecedentedly fast change in the lives of residents of rich nations brought with it profound 
political instability and conflict. Perhaps the worst off were residents of the Global South, and 
oppressed communities like women and racial minorities in the Global North, who were denied much of 
the benefit of the worlda€™ s economic revolutions while suffering the bulk of
the harm from the ensuing political and social revolutions.

DeLong and I talked last week about the book, the economic significance of the long 20th century, 
what caused technological progress to speed up so dramatically, and whether this kind of explosive 
growth can continue.
A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

You argue that 1870 through 2010 were a€oethe most consequential years of all humanitya€™ s 
centuries.a€n Whata€™ s your case?

Brad DeLong

It really looks that we had as much technological change and progress between 1870 and today as we 
had between 6000 BC and 1870 AD. We packed what had previously been nearly eight millennia of 
changes in the underlying technological hardware of society, which required changes in the running 
sociological code on top of that hardware. To try to pack what had been eight millennia worth of 
changes before in 150 years is going to produce an awful lot of
history.

Before 1870, most of history is how elites run their force-and-fraud, domination-and-extraction 
mechanism against a poor peasantry so that they, at least, can have enough, and so that their 
children are only two inches shorter than we are, rather than five or six as the peasants are. 
Ita€™ s about how the elites elbow each other out of the way as they eat from the trough. And ita€™ 
s about the use they make of their wealth for purposes good and ill, of civilization
and destruction.

But if youa€™re enough of a Marxist, like me, to say that the real motor of history is the forces 
of production, their changes, and how society reacts for good or ill to changing forces of 
production, then yes, [1870 to 2010] has to be as consequential because therea€™ s as much 
technological change-driven history as there is in entire millennia before.

Dylan Matthews

You seem on solid ground in arguing that something radical changed that enabled humans to become 
dramatically richer over the last 300 years; almost every economic historian would agree with that. 
But many people start the story in the 18th century, with the development of the steam engine and 
the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain. You start it in 1870, well after that 
process was underway.
Why does the story start later for you?

Brad DeLong

When do we start? Leta€™ s start 300 million years ago in the Permian period, when plants die and 
they get pushed underground and turn into coal. And then we flash forward to 25,000 years ago, when 
the last glacier episode scrapes all the rock on top of the coal deposits off of the British Isles 
and then retreats, leaving Britain with an ungodly amount of surface coal at sea level. Since ita€™ 
s a wet island, ita€™ s thereupon very easy to move by water.
You need a steam engine if you want to dig even 10 feet down in order to get out the coal, and then 
around 1770, the steam engine and textile machinery attained critical mass and the Industrial 
Revolution begins, which is usually taken as the hinge of economic history, although some people 
push it back further.

However, you look worldwide and you take my index of technological progress, and it [grows by] less 
than half a percent per year from 1770 to 1870. Thata€™ s based on exploitation of really cheap 
coal and also on the productivity benefits of falling transport costs that gather all of the 
manufacturing in the world into the place [the United Kingdom] where ita€™ s most productive and 
most efficient, because ita€™ s the place where coal is cheapest.

I was struck by a line I came across from the 1871 version of John Stuart Milla€™ s Principles of 
Political Economy: d^erHitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have 
lightened the daya€™ s toll of any human being ,a€D


the harm from the ensuing political and social revolutions.

Say you have some slowdown in global technological progress after 1870 because the cheapest coal 
has already been mined and the deeper coal is hard to find, and say that you have some other 
slowdown because you dona€™ t get the boost from gathering manufacturing in places where ita€™ s 
productive. We might well have wound up right with a steampunk world after 1870: a world with about 
the population of today, but the living standards of 1870 on
average.

Thata€™ s what the pace of progress was, except that we got the industrial research lab, the modern 
corporation, and then full globalization around 1870. The industrial research lab rationalized and 
routinized the discovery and development of technologies; the corporation rationalized and 
routinized the development and deployment of technologies; and globalization diffused them 
everywhere.

For most of human history since the advent of agriculture, we were ruled by Malthusian dynamics: If 
we gained the ability to grow more food, we would simply have more children, meaning no onea€™ s 
quality of life could improve too much. And this, of course, put tremendous pressure on women, who 
were expected to have many children and do almost all the biological and practical work of 
gestating and raising them.
You cite a very striking statistic in the book: the average number of years of a womana€™ s life 
spent either pregnant or breastfeeding. That has gone down dramatically, from 20 years of a typical 
womana€™ s life in 1870 to four years today. Explain that number to me, and what it means.

Brad DeLong

Ita€™ s from a book called Womena€™s Work: The First 20,000 Years by Elizabeth Wayland Barber. We 
really do not know much about what human life was really like in the hunter-gatherer age. Once we 
have agriculture, productivity goes way up. Life becomes somewhat boring because our brains are 
probably built to be hunter-gatherers. Population grows, and living standards fall.
You have this biological situation in which one in seven women appears to die in childbirth; in 
which [to expect] one son surviving, you need to have two kids survive, which means three reach 
early adulthood, which means four reach the age of 5, which means seven or so babies born, which 
means nine advanced pregnancies.

Once you become an undernourished, agrarian Malthusian being, all of a sudden you are biometrically 
close to being effed completely.

Your childrena€™ s immune systems are too compromised to fight off the common cold. Maybe youa€™ re 
too skinny to ovulate. If you arena€™ t, maybe you lose two teeth and break an arm as the baby 
leeches calcium out of your body into itself. Then you add on to that the fact that patriarchy 
means that if you are female, your only durable source of social power is to have surviving sons. 
And so any temptation to do much of anything other than have
surviving sons, and then have more as insurance, is very hard to resist. Those are the biological, 
ecological, economic forces tending toward patriarchy, of which men as a group then took absolutely 
horrible advantage.

And yet once technological progress starts to hit 2 percent per year, then some people begin to 
have incomes above subsistence and infant mortality falls. But those changes came remarkably 
quickly.

Dylan Matthews

The highlight of the 140 years you study are the Thirty Glorious Years: roughly from 1945 to 1975, 
as the US and Europe recovered from World War II. They managed to build economies and welfare 
states that directed substantial benefits to working-class people while sustaining really fast 
productivity growth. After the 1970s, that regime broke down.
I finished the book thinking, a€oeHow can we get back to those 30 years? How do we get fast growth 
and equitable growth like that again?a€D But at the same time, many people you might think 
sympathetic to that vision are instead questioning the value of economic growth or calling for 
a€oedegrowtha€D as a way to manage global warming.

Is it possible to go back to the Thirty Glorious Years? Or do we need degrowth instead?

Brad DeLong

We definitely need to decarbonize. But go back to the steampunk world a€” suppose that we hadna€™ t 
had the last acceleration and wea€™ re at the 1900 level of technology. Wea€™ d be pumping out only 
about a third or a quarter as much carbon dioxide as we are now, but wea€™ d be pumping out many, 
many tonloads of other pollutants.
Think of the amount of farmers and farmland that we would have needed in order to support 8 billion 
people on 1900 technology. Those were days when wea€™ d send people with pickaxes to islands off of 
the South Atlantic to knock tons of bird shit off to try to boost agricultural yields by a little 
bit.

Degrowth is a mistake because we still have our bottom 500 million [people in global poverty], who 
certainly deserve much better. We certainly need much better technologies to deal with global 
warming. But do we indeed have to worry more about how to utilize our wealth, and less about how to 
produce much more wealth? I would say probably so. The best minds of a generation moving to South 
of Market in San Francisco to figure out how to scare the shit
out of people and glue their eyeballs to screens a€” thata€™ s not a terribly good use of human 
brainpower.
