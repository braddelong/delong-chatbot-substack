Opening Statement

Will there be inflation?

There will be inflation. Right now we are attempting to rejoin traffic at speed. Here in the United 
States we are convincing 10 million workers to rejoin the labor force. Here in the United States we 
are convincing 500,000 employers to employ them. Furthermore, we need to move 4% of the labor force 
across sectors because we are going to have a much more online and more last-mile 
distribution-heavy economy in the future than we had in the past. Significant
relative wage differentials in favor of expanding sectors will be needed to pull workers in. 
Because of the psychological impossibility of cutting nominal wages in modern economiesa€”this has 
been the case for a century or soa€”higher real wages in growing sectors means rising wages 
overall. Moreover, there are lots of reopening supply bottlenecks. Most of those bottlenecks will 
kind of show up as supply shortages and much longer delivery times: the world
auto companies are not paying other chip customers for their places in line for the chips coming 
out of TSMC, Samsung, and company, but are waiting their turn, yelling for political help, and 
smiling because the chip supply shortage with available chips parceled out in proportion to demand 
has accidentally allowed them to collude and raise prices. Not all of the reopening bottlenecks are 
showing up as delays and shortages. Some will show up in higher prices.

And that will produce inflation.

How much inflation? We do not know. We have never tried to do anything like this beforea€”so much, 
so fast, perhaps five times the scale of the largest previous structural adjustment. Assuming that 
relationships are linear is an extremely bad thing to assume when we are so far out of previous 
experience. There will be inflation for the next year and a half.

How persistent will the inflation be? Will it continue into 2023 and beyond? My guess, and it is 
just a guess, is that it will not. It took many repeated substantial shocks to de-anchor inflation 
expectations over 1965-75 to create the inflation we saw in the late 1970s. We are unlikely to have 
such a series of shocks. And in the absence of such a series that de-anchors expectations, the 
Phillips curve is and has been relatively flat.

Economists have been going back over the experience of the 1960s and the 1970s. The most impressive 
piece I have seen is by Emi Nakamura and John Steinsson, both of whom Berkeley stole from Columbia 
three years ago. They took a look at whether the Phillips curve was flat or steep in the United 
States in the 1970s and early 1980s. They came up with the somewhat paradoxical conclusion that 
while the Phillips curve was quite steep at the macro level,
with relatively small changes in employment and unemployment leading to substantial changes in 
inflation, it was very flat at the micro state and the city level, with an excess supply or an 
excess demand for labor in a particular city or a particular state having very little impact on the 
prices of non-tradables and the wages of people in those states and cities.

This points strongly to the nationwide formation of expectations and the impact of expectations of 
inflation on inflation outcomes as the dominant factors. People mark up their demands for wages and 
their plans for prices according to what they think the average rate of inflation is going to be. 
And actual supply-and-demand pressure cause only small deviations from those plans. At the moment 
it looks like inflation expectations have for a generation been very
stablea€’’highly anchored. People see year-to-year movements in inflation, but they do not 
incorporate those movements into their expectations. Rather, they expect inflation to revert to its 
past mean value. Thus people have strong confidence in central banks. As long as that confidence in 
central banks lasts, the inflation we will see over the next year and a half will not lead to 
higher inflation in 2023 and beyond.

We will be burning rubber, leaving skid marks on the road as we enter traffic at speed. We will not 
boil over and melt our economic engine.

Can the Fed stop inflation? It definitely can. And I think it will: it has ever since 1979. Before 
then, it required a very strange concatenation of events for the Fed not to stop inflation from 
1969 to 1979.1 have been powerfully influenced by Arthur Burns's late-1950s presidential address to 
the American Economic Association. He contrasted the old business cycle in which governments did 
not take strong action to boost the economy out of a recession with the
new one. In the old business cycle, labor union demands for wage increases were always greatly 
curbed by the fact that having high wages would make its members' jobs an obvious target when the 
inevitable big recession came. But, Burns said, we live in this new business cycle in which people 
expect the government to prevent large downturns, Thus there are no curbs on labor union wage 
demands. Inflation is then not a problem that can be solved by
economic means. It has to be solved by political meansa€’’congress has to do it.

Moreover Arthur Burns thought, the independence of the Fed is a very important thing. It will not 
survive if Congress believes that the Fed deliberately triggered a deep recession. These all are 
the reasons that led Arthur Burns to make his 180-degree turn at the start of the 1970s, to oppose 
his long-time patron, the guy who had appointed him, President Richard Nixon, and begin calling for 
wage and price controls. That was a very surprising thing for a central
banker to do.

But you needed more than Burns to get the inflation of the 1970s. You also needed Richard Nixon and 
John Connally, who broke the Bretton Woods system because, as their then-underling Paul Volcker 
said, they were both strongly in favor of bold action but had no preferences as to what or in which 
direction the action should be bold. You had to add a strong union movement both in the United 
States and Britaina€”less so in the rest of Europea€”that did really
not understand the stakes and did not realize that the continuation of a labor-relations system 
quite congenial to them depended on their willingness to exercise wage restraint and so assist 
governments keep inflation from rising.

Add in the 2.5%-point/year slowdown in productivity growth in the early 1970s.
Add in King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran.

All of those things had to be working against the normal culture of central banks and inflation 
control for 1969-1979 to happen. I do not see the very same, a similar, very strange concatenation 
of events coming in the next decade. I think in the medium run of three to four years, Fed 
culturea€’’which Jay Powell is pushing the limits ofa€”will reassert itself inside the Eccles 
building. The Federal Reserve will do what it takes to keep inflation from continually
overshooting its targeta€”2%/year for the PCE deflator, which means something like 2.5%/year for 
the core CPI.

Rough Reconstruction of Other Things I Said:

Let me offer a very brief precis of what I understood Professor Goodhart to be saying. He focused 
on the structural factors driving inflationary pressures. Times of hyperglobalization, in which the 
world's international division of labor changes and deepens, are times in which there are 
deflationary pressuresa€”so many opportunities to lower costs are being grabbed. Times in which the 
world economy's global division of labor is more or lessstatic tend to be
times of inflationary pressures. Times in which demands on governments are relatively stable are 
times of neutrality. But times in which demands on governments undergo structural 
increasesa€’’inflation and seigniorage are ways of raising money, and inevitably as governments try 
to meet the commitments that their electorates demand they resort to them at some point at some 
time to some degree.

For example, during the Second Hundred Years, from the coup of William of Orange in 1688 on up 
through the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, the British government faced the extraordinary 
demands from the financing required for the British Imperial fiscal-military state. And in the 
years after World War II you had the expansion of the social-insurance state. Those were both 
sources of structuralinflationary pressure. From 1980 on upto very recently,
Goodhart is saying, hyperglobalization has been putting deflationary pressure on the world economy. 
That is now coming to an end. And the aging of society is going to put enormous 
structural-inflationary pressures on global-north governments. I agree with all of this.

Buta€”even though it is always very intellectually hazardous to disagree with Charles Goodhart: 
people who do so usually wind up embarrassed and apologizing three years latera€”I find myself 
thinking that while these structural pressures on inflation are there, they are second-order. The 
first-order factors for the next generation are much more the monetary and the macro and the 
expectational. Why? Because in our age the inflation rate is an explicit target of
central banks and governments in a way that it was not up until, say, 1980 or so. That makes a 
difference: central banks focus on neutralizing the structural factors, and are able to do so.

Even earlier, structural factors could be overwhelmed by substantial changes in monetary affairs. 
The discovery of massive amounts of extremely low-quality gold in the Witwatersrand made a huge 
difference, once that had triggered the construction of both a modern railroad from the Natal coast 
to transport it and a world-class frontier organic chemistry industry in Johannesberg to process 
it. The deflationary pressures of the late 1800s came to a sudden end,
and from 1896 on the world economy shifted into an inflationary boom

We economists are stuck now where we have been since the late 1930s, when Ragnar Nurkse looked back 
over the preceding 50 years, and the concluded that much depended on whether expectations were 
mean-reverting or extrapolative. Countries in which people thought that exchange rates and 
inflation rates and price levels would return to normal had enormous freedom of action in their 
policies, and could conduct extraordinary successful economic
stabilization campaigns. Countries in which expectations became extrapolativea€”ones in which a 
decline in the value of the currency now led people to think it is likely to decline further and we 
need to sell, in which people think that inflation now means not just inflation but higher 
inflation next yeara€”had no good options. I think Nurkse's insight is true. Our problem is that we 
have nothing good coming from either psychology or economics as to when such
expectational shift of rA©gime takes place. We can point to individual historical examples: 
Franklin Roosevelt's inauguration, the Volcker disinflation, Francois Mitteranda€™ s declarations 
that he was going to reflate the French economy which led to an outburst of inflation even before 
he was elected, and left him with no good policy options in the late 1970s.

One thought: we look at our financial markets, and we see that right now participation and 
engagement appears to be, to put it politely, highly elastic. The comments of Elon Musk on Saturday 
Night Live and of participants in Reddit forums can cause massive and immediate divergences between 
prices and fundamental valuesa€’’divergences that shock investors and traders who Iwould 
havethought were very well-informed and cautiousin their hedging. A
market as "frothy" as the financial markets we seem to be building today on top of social 
mediaa€”those are ones in which extrapolative expectations, and thus loss of the ability to 
successfully stabilize, are more likely.

It took a decade, starting with Lyndon Johnson's calling William McChesney Martin into the Oval 
Office in 1966 to ask him not to raise interest rates just then, and ending with the very 
overoptimistic decisions of the Ford Treasury and of the Burns Federal Reserve after the 1975 
recession that expectations were normal and that reflation was appropriate. I feel as though things 
areaboutas well anchored now as they were in 1965. That means that if weget
through this wave by 2024, things are likely to go back to normala€’’except for all the structural 
factors that Professor Goodhart emphasized.

I would point out that there is an awful lot of inertia in nominal long rates. If there is a single 
regularity in the long bond market over the United States over the past 70 years, it is that it is 
very difficult to get bond traders as a group to very quickly revise their anchor points as to what 
these things should be selling for. During the run-up of inflation from 1965 to 1981, bond traders 
appear to have been at least half-oblivious to what was happening. After the
Volcker disinflation, anchor points in bond markets kept long-term real interest rates at 
extraordinarily high levels for a full generation. I think Professor Goodhart is right: tapering is 
likely to be the first thing that centra. But even so, the nominal long bond rate is likely to 
remain substantially anchored for a decadea€’’which would then lead one to expect a decade or so of 
even lower real long rates than we have now, hard as that may be to believe.

Yes, being a central banker is going to be very difficult over the next 10 years. But when has it 
not been very difficult? In the 1990s, when Alan Greenspan and company had only either good options 
or better options, because the world economy was stable and they had considerable help from the 
U.S. administration headed by Bill Clinton which was aggressively interested in long-run fiscal 
stabilization and solvency. Lloyd Bentsen and Robert Rubin were
Secretaries of the Treasury, and were eager to make the Fed's job much easier, and worked hard and 
spend political capital to accomplish that. That was about the only decade in which being a central 
banker was a fun and a happy experience.

Yes, debt levels area€”I won't say unprecedented, certainly Britain after the Napoleonic Wars had a 
much larger debt overhang in proportion to GDPa€”. But counterbalancing that is the extraordinary 
willingness of and in fact eager demand by investors around the world for safe assets, which they 
define as the liabilities of governments that possess exorbitant privilege on a large 
scalea€’’issuing their own debt to add to the world stock of reserves, and then
rolling over that stock at interest rates less than the growth rate of the economy as a whole. It 
is very close to being a free lunch for Britain, for the European Union, for Japan, for the United 
Statesa€”and possibly soon for Chinaa€”to issue debt.

Normally, when you borrow or when you accept deposits, you have to pay people interest for the use 
of their money. But Britain, the EU, Japan and the US are instead, effectively charging their 
lenders fees for keeping their money and wealth safe and liquid.That is and has been the situation 
for the past 15 years. How long will this last? No one can tell. But as long as it lasts, the 
market economy is telling us that, worldwide, investors regard the debts of the
countries with exorbitant privilege as extraordinarily valuable assets. In a market economy you 
have very strong incentives if you cana€”you become healthy and wealthy, and people think you wise 
if you doa€”create incredibly valuable assets.

What worries me is the extremely short duration of all of these governments' debts. I really wish 
that the treasuries were testing the market by attempting substantial increases in average debt 
maturity. I still do not understand why Janet Yellen isn't issuing both a nominal and a 
inflation-indexed consol right now, and seeing what the market for those things are. That would 
bring us a great deal of valuable information about what the available space for fiscal
management is that we do not now have.
