Key Insights:

1. We may well face a generation of right-wing culture war-fueled minority rule in this country.

2. American Progressives have proven bad at making alliances with moderate conservatives^’’and at 
giving conservative voters reasons to vote for moderates.

3. Worry most about American national declinea€’’which is happening anyway.

4. American exceptionalism and America as a a€cecity upon a hilla€D for the worlda€”that is gone. 
We are no longer a model to emulate, but a horrible warning of a society gone wrong.

5. The things that are real to progressives are fake: democracy is not going to be destroyed by the 
failure to pass the John Lewis voting rights act, but by state legislature-level nullification

6. The thngs that are real to Republicans are fake: what is being taught to students is not 
a€oecritical race theorya€D but simply a€cehistorya€D, vaccines are not a plot to control us, and 
the 2020 election was not stolen.

7. The Republican bullshit is more egregious, but progressive bullshit is still bullshit. The 
saying both sides have bullshit does not mean they are equivalent.

8. The best we can hope for is simple exhaustion on both sides.

9. But every time we try to get out, they pull us back in.

10. Hexapodia!
