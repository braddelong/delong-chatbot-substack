With the coming of the industrial research lab, the modern corporation, and truly cheap ocean and land transport and communication, we went from a world in which economic patterns formed a semi-stable backdrop of grinding mass poverty into one where the economy was constantly revolutionizing itself.” J Bradford DeLong, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, tells this remarkable story with verve. Alas, it is also, in his opinion, now over.</p></blockquote><p>&amp; Andrew Kelly says that it is not only “an important book built on many years of research and thinking”. It is “also a terrific read—a model for economics books.” </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/pandaemoniumnow/status/1595329609641361408&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Delighted to see <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@delong</span>’s book as one of the economics books of the year in the FT.

Enormous productivity growth and real wage increases.... [Yes,] inflationary and... productivity slowdown speed bump[s]… people… angry at bureaucracy… at unions that they saw as having... monop[sony]... power… [But that] shouldn’t have led to the... collapse within less than a decade of the most successful political economic system and order that the world had ever seen...</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong>&nbsp;The bad neoliberalism... is: the market giveth,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the market taketh away, blessed be the name of the market.... The belief that if property rights are cut at the joints, the market… crowdsources the problem of increasing production… mobilizes human brain power to making a richer world in a way  no other system can. But... at a horrible price. A market system cannot provide any form of social justice, and if you demand that it be tweaked and managed to do so, that would wreck the market’s ability to do what it could.... This is Margaret Thatcher’s TINA... “there is no alternative”...</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong>&nbsp;There was a left neoliberalism as well... the post–World War II system had become overbureaucratized... encrusted with rent-seeking… politically strong clients... [with] ]weak claims…p Aroperly constructed market economy crowdsources… solution[s]... [better than] bureaucrat[s]... or some central planner.... [as] people on the spot with the information are empowered to act and to act for the common good.... Left neoliberalism, of which I was once a card-carrying member... [saw itself as] a huge improvement over... the post–World War II generation [system]...</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong>&nbsp;Left and...&nbsp; right neoliberals alternated, but... whenever we left neoliberals did something like balance the budget in the interest of faster economic growth, the right… promptly… fund[s] many more bigger tax cuts for the rich...</p><p><strong>Brad: </strong>The neoliberal order persisted.... Its three promises... restore productivity growth... right the distribution of income by getting rid of various intermediar[ies with]... market and regulatory power... restore the moral center of life by making people realize that they could not [always] rely on the government… [if] they didn’t make good decisions…. It did absolutely none of those things. All it did was greatly widen income and wealth inequality…. And yet, it went… putting along… survived… the 1980s… the 1990s… comes roaring back in the 2000s, and no matter what you want to say about the end of the neoliberal order in the ashes of the fires caused by the Great Recession, I look around and it’s still there...</p><p class="button-wrapper"

href="https://prospect.org/power/congressmembers-tried-to-stop-secs-inquiry-into-ftx/">Congressmembers Tried to Stop the SEC’s Inquiry Into FTX</a>: ‘The ‘Blockchain Eight’ wrote a bipartisan letter in March attempting to chill the SEC’s information requests to crypto firms. FTX was one of those firms: Tom Emmer (R-MN), whom the Republican caucus just elected as majority whip, the number three position in the House GOP leadership, led the letter....&nbsp; “My office has received numerous tips from crypto and blockchain firms that SEC Chair Gary Gensler's nformation reporting ‘requests’ to the crypto community are overburdensome, don’t feel particularly … voluntary … and are stifling innovation.”... Byron Donalds (R-FL) said through a spokesperson that the congressman was not attempting to influence ongoing investigations at the SEC.... Jake Auchincloss (D-MA), another of the signatories, told the <em>Prospect</em>, “The congressman has been clear from day one that crypto needs strong and clear laws from Congress. The SEC will need to explain to Congress why, despite claiming that it didn’t need new laws for exchanges, it failed to foresee this meltdown.”... []Also] Warren Davidson (R-OH), Ted Budd (R-NC), Darren Soto (D-FL), Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), and Ritchie Torres (D-NY).
