A very nice piece from Rafael Guthmann. But I do have a quibble:

Rafael R. Guthmann: The Malthusian Trap Never Existed'. a€~Froma€! Buringh (2021), and Bairoch and 
Goertz (1986), I estimated Europea€™ s urban populationa€! and dividing by the estimated population 
of Europe over the past 3,000 years we get the foliowinga€! a much more nuanced and interesting 
trajectory of macroeconomic performance for Europe than the Malthusian-trap modela€!. It also shows 
that there was slow progress upwards
from the 8th century to the 18th century, roughly at 10% of the urbanization growth rate in the 
19th and 20th centuries. The decline and fall of the Roman Empire from the 2nd century to the 7th 
century is also cleara€! the greatest sustained process of economic regression in human historya€L 
The economic flourishing of Classical Greece and other parts of the European Mediterranean from the 
9tha€! century BC appear to have constituted the

fastest period of economic growth in Europe until the latea€“18th centurya€!.

European urbanization rates over three millennia

50.0%

45.0%

35.0%

30.0%

25.0%

15.0%


10.0%

0.0%

The urbanization rate suggests that over the last three millennia of the history of Europe, there 
were long and sustained periods of economic progress and regression and that modern economic growth 
has been a dramatic acceleration compared to the pre-modern trend, instead of a complete break from 
ita€!

Rafaela€™ s Commentary

The Malthusian Trap Never Existed

Economists often assume that there was no economic growth before the late 18th-century takeoff of 
modern economic growth. For example, this graph is typically used as a quick description of world 
economic history. This conceptualization is boring if one is interested in pre-modern history as it 
suggests that nothing very interesting in economic terms haa€!

My quibble: I think it unwise to call these pre-1750 rA©gimes a€cenon-Malthusiana€D in any profound 
sense.

Let us build a Solow-Malthus model. Let us start by saying there is technologya€”the discovered, 
developed, deployed, and diffused set of useful ideas about manipulating nature and organizing 
humans to make us more productive. Let us call the level of technology H. Let's also say that there 
is a population/labor force La€”no real reason to distinguish between them. And let us also say 
that there is an efficiency of labor E, conceptually different from technology because
of the impact of resource abundance or scarcity on labor efficiency. And let us use h, n, and g for 
the proportional growth rates of H, L, and E:

dHIdt = hH dLldt = nL dEldt = gE

Let us then say that the level of output per worker or per capitaa€”again, no great reason to 
distinguish sharply between thema€”y is determined by the economya€™ s capital-intensity dDoe..., 
the salience of capital in production I*, and labor efficiency E. And let us remember that in Bob 
Solowa€™ s standard model the equilibrium (for which we will use *) level of capital intensity 
dDoe... is equal to the economya€™ s savings-investment rate s divided by its investment
requirements, which are the sum of the labor-efficiency growth rate g, the labor-force growth rate 
n, and the depreciation rate I'. (Yes, I know, I know: it makes no conceptual sense to assume that 
peoplea€™ s gross savings is a constant share of gross production because they never take any 
account of the changing relative wedge between gross and net production. I asked Bob Solow about 
this once. He shrugged and said: referees. We use the consensus models we have.)

y = KeE K* = s/(n + g + S)

Now let us make the model Malthusian. Let us say that the growth rate of labor efficiency g is 
equal to the growth rate of the useful-ideas stock h minus the labor-force growth rate n divided by 
the salience E£ of ideas in labor efficiency. Why? Because a higher labor force induces resource 
scarcity which is a drag on labor efficiency. And let us now compare the level of output per capita 
y to some a€cesubsistencea€D level of necessities consumption yAsub times some
allowance for a€oeluxuriesa€n It. When production per capita is such that after allowing for 
luxuries necessities consumption is greater than subsistence, the population grows, with I2 
capturing how much extra population growth is induced by a given wedge between necessities 
consumption and subsistence:

g = h — n/y

This is a thoroughly Malthusian model. We can see immediately that it has an equilibrium balanced 
growth path at which capital intensity and productivity are at their equilibrium values and the 
population and labor force are growing at the rate warranted by the rate of ideas growth and the 
salience of ideas in generating labor efficiency:

dy*mal!dt = 0 when n"mal = yh


If we crank through the algebra, we can see that this modela€™ s equilibrium is rather rich. Along 
the equilibrium balanced-growth path, we have equilibrium income per capita:

In this model, the most important determinants of the equilibrium level of income per capita are 
the societya€™ s taste for luxuries multiplied by its level of a€oesubsistence^□ necessities 
consumption. Both of these are profoundly socio-economic factors, potentially different for 
different societies and potentially changing over time. How much of its productivity society 
diverts from making commodities directly useful for boosting nutrition and reproductive fitness and,
instead, devotes to conveniences and luxuriesa€’’including the "luxuries" of having an upper class, 
and the a€cesuper-luxurya€D of living in cities and gaining all the conveniences and benefits of 
urban life at the cost of making itself more vulnerable to plague and diseasea€”are not biological 
factors fixed in stone but are instead the result of a societya€™ s sociology, economic structure, 
and politics. What a societya€™ s level of a€cesubsistencea€D necessities
consumption happens to be is itself as much a sociological as a biological fact. At what age do 
women become sexually active? Is female infanticide a thing, and if so how much of a thing? Does 
the societya€™ sa€”or do the societiesa€™ a€”social practice of war involve mass sacrifice of 
captives to gods, or routinely carving the blood eagle, or chevauchA©^,

In this model, the most important determinants of the equilibrium level of population relative to 
resources are (a) the current level of the value of the ideas stock H divided by subsistence 
necessities consumption, the economya€™ s savings-investment share s divided by the depreciation 
rate I', (c) the salience Z, of capital in generating production, (d) the (inverse of the) taste 
for a€oeluxuriesa€n It, all raised to the power E£ that is the salience of ideas vis-A -vis 
resources
in generating labor efficiency. As known above, the a€cetastea€D for a€celuxuriesa€O is in no wise 
a matter of biology, and the level of a€oesubsistencea€n necessities consumption only partially so. 
In the equilibrium-population equation, moreover, the economya€™ s savings-investment share of 
production is also a key important variable. A functioning imperial peace, institutions supporting 
commerce and property that make it worthwhile to create and invest heavily in
a sophisticated and productive division of labor, habits of mind and culture that reward 
cooperation and productivity instead of or even as well as dominationa€”all of these can and do 
have profound influences on a societya€™ s equilibrium capital intensity. In the Malthusian 
equilibrium of this model these factors affect population and population density, but surely there 
is feedback from capital intensity and population density to the economya€™ s tastes for luxuries as
well.

Is this model I have set out a very powerful intuition pump? Is it merely a useful filing system? 
Is it a pointless scholastic exercise, leading to conclusions that any thinking human could have 
arrived at much more easily by other means? Is it a way of excluding people who do not have a 
certain particular familiarity with some kind of math from the discourse? Yes.

But I at least find it useful for making my major point: Our economic growth since 1870, and to 
some degree over 1770 to 1870, comes from breaking the Malthusian link between prosperity and 
population growth, first partially and now completelya€’’the demographic transition and the rise of 
modern feminism, and the creation of a society in which durable female social power does not rely 
near-completely upon being the mother of surviving sonsa€”and from the
extraordinary waves of technological development. But previous a€oeefflorescencesa€D, in Jack 
Goldstonea€™ s word, up to 1750 (and their inverse: collapses and dark ages) rely not on shifts in 
the technology growth rate h and feminist social revolutions, but instead on sociology, economics, 
and politics that produce durable alterations in 'a€oesubsistencea€n necessities consumption yAsub, 
the 'a€oetastea€n for a€oeluxuriesa€n It, and the creation and maintenance of
imperial peace and other a€ceinclusivea€D institutions that drive large shifts in s. Plus we then 
have the dynamics of convergence to a society a€™ s Malthusian equilibrium from an initial state 
off of the equilibrium path.

I think a great deal is gained by calling such a€ceefflorescencesa€D and dark ages Malthusian, for 
I think they are, and that some insight is lost by rejecting the label.
