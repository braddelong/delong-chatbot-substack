Thus the first sign we see of the disease is a&nbsp;<strong>huge</strong>&nbsp;cluster among lab workers. Did we see such a cluster? No. We see no antibodies in lab workers. We see three lab workers catching what look to be bad cases of the flu in November 2019, and then no radiation until we get the superspreader event at the market:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Aylin Woodward</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Lab Leak vs. Animal Spillover: Evidence for Coronavirus Origin Theories</em>: ‘The WIV staff said they found no evidence that samples of the new coronavirus had been stored at the institute…. Records reviewed by WHO did not indicate that any viruses closely related to the new coronavirus were kept in any Chinese lab…. [But] the WHO team spent just hours at the institute—which isn’t enough time to pore over files, databases, or freezer inventories. The institute’s staff also did not share all of its records or safety logs…. Shi Zhengli… “is absolutely positive that she had never identified this virus prior to the outbreak happening,” Mazet told Insider…. Three WIV staff members got sick and went to a hospital more than a month before experts identified the first COVID–19 cases in Wuhan… [with] symptoms… “consistent with both COVID–19 and common seasonal illness”… blood samples taken from WIV staff in the months ahead of the pandemic all tested negative for coronavirus antibodies…. Fauci said… it’s more likely that the coronavirus got good at jumping between people while spreading “below the radar” in China in late 2019… spreading for several weeks, if not months, before the first cases were reported. That allowed the virus “to be pretty well adapted when first recognized,” Fauci said… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-lab-leak-animal-spillover-coronavirus-origin-questions-2021-5">https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-lab-leak-animal-spillover-coronavirus-origin-questions-2021-5</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>And remember:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Soonergrunt</strong>: ‘<em>Just because China isn’t being forthright with information</em>, it doesn’t mean Eli Lake isn’t a mendacious s—bird.
