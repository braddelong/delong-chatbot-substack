Matt Levine: Will WallStreetBets Face SEC Scrutiny After GameStop Rally?'. a€~Of course the chart 
of GameStop Corp.a€™ s stock price from yesterday is nuts. It closed on
Friday at $65.01, opened yesterday at $96.73, got as high as $159.18 and as low as $61.13, and 
closed at $76.79. Almost 178 million shares traded, worth almost $17 billion.

GameStopa€™ s 10-day realized volatility is 308%. I am typing these words before the market opens 
on Tuesday, but by the time I send them the stock will have been trading for
hours, and I am sure that it will have touched $4 and $4,000 and every number in between. It seems 
meaningless to talk about the price of GameStop stock, as though a single
number could represent such an elusive concept. GameStop stock has all the prices at once. Maybe 
the craziest thing in the chart is not the wild spikes up and down, but the flat lulls
when no one was trading because the stock exchange wouldna€™ t let them. a€oeThe stock surged as 
much as 145% to $159.18 on Monday,a€D reports Bloomberg

Michael Hiltzik: Trade the GameStop short squeeze if you wish, but ita€™ s very stupid'. a€~The 
online traders have decided to stage a massive assault on short sellers by driving
up the share price of a money-losing retailer of video games and consoles named GameStopa€!. 
GameStop shares were trading in the $2-to-$4 range as recently as April. As I write,
theya€™re at $132 and change, up more than 60% on the day. Theya€™re up about 505% this year 
already. This action has produced massive losses among short sellers, who
thought GameStop was an OK stock to short a year ago. Among the biggest losers is the hedge fund 
Melvin Capital Management, which is headed by a very well-known Wall
Street  star. Melvina€™ s reported losses on GameStop and other misplayed short bets forced it to 
seek a nearly $3-billion bailout from two other hedge funds this week. On the
Reddit forum WallStreetBets and among other small investors posting online, the glee is palpablea€!

Katherine Burton & Hema Parmar: _How Reddit r/wallstreetbets Traders Squeezed Gamestop (GME) Short 
Melvin Capital: a€™ An online crowd targets a hedge fund star and
inflicts losses. But Steve Cohen and Ken Griffin are betting he will prevail. The first sign of 
trouble for hedge fund wunderkind Gabe Plotkin came in late October: A poster on
Reddita€™ s popular wallstreetbets forum was taking aim at his wildly successful investment firm. 
a€oeGME Squeeze and the demise of Melvin Capital,a€D wrote the user,
Stonksflyingup, referring to stock ticker of GameStop Corp, and Plotkina€™ s $12.5 billion firm. 
Before long, veryforestgreen weighed in: a€oeMelvin Capital New Short
Attack.a€D    Then, greekgodl990: a€oeMelvin vs WSB! And GME to the moon.a€D So it was thata€! a 
hedge fund star suddenly found himself at the mercy of the day-trading
Reddit                                                                                   bros who 
have become one of the most powerful, if improbable, forces in the stock market today. The attack 
on Plotkina€™ s six-year-old Melvin Capital shifted the balance
of power in ways that would have seemed unimaginable only months ago. By Wednesday, the firm had 
capitulated to the amateurs and covered the GameStop short. The explosive
growth in retail day-trading, powered by platforms like the Robinhood trading app and forums like 
wallstreetbets, has turned the old order on its head. Melvin Capitala€™ s
mistake, if it can be called that, was leaving footprints behind in the marketplace. Reddit users 
were able to identify stocks that Melvin was wagering against and then buy those en
masse, unleashing a violent run-up in prices that turned Melvina€™ s winning bet into a losera€!. A 
classic $50 short can lose multiples that amount if the stock soars. And while
using options may limit losses, investors can get wiped out quickly if the stock rises. The shorts 
that were listed in Melvina€™ s regulatory filing from the third quarter all rocketed
in recent weeks. Names include Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., iRobot Corp, and GSX Techedu Inc. GameStop, 
the stock that seemed to set off the short squeeze, soared 634% in the
month through Tuesday and an additional 31% in post-market trading after Elon Musk tweeted a link 
to the Reddit thread with the caption a€oeGamestonk! !a€da€l Until this year,
Plotkin, 42, had one of the best track records among hedge fund stock pickers. Hea€™ d worked for 
Cohen for eight years and had been one of his biggest money makers before
leaving to form Melvina€’’named after his grandfathera€”in December 2014a€!. Why they singled out 
Melvin remains a mystery. As far as hedge fund managers go, Plotkin is
considered low keya€L Investors have been expressing faith that Plotkin will climb out of this 
hole. Griffin said Monday that he and his partners a€oehave great confidence in Gabe
and his team.a€D Cohen called him a€oean exceptional investor and leader.a€D A person familiar with 
the thinking inside Plotkina€™ s firm said one lesson is clear: Dona€™ t
leave a trace and only buy put options over the counter. a€oeThis phenomenon of retail investors 
jumping on a bandwagon to dominate trading activity is a new kind of portfolio
risk,a€D said Jay Raffaldini, global head of sales and distribution at UBS Oa€™ Connora€!
