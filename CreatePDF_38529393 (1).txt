On Racial Justice, Individual Guilt, and Institutional Responsibility

Paragraphs:

Stephen S. Roach: Chinaa€™ s Animal Spirits Deficit'. a€~A longtime China optimist fears the recent 
tech crackdowns represent a tipping point: When it comes to the Chinese economy, I have been a 
congenital optimist for
over 25 years. But now I have serious doubts. The Chinese government has taken dead aim at its 
dynamic technology sector, the engine of Chinaa€™ s New Economy. Its recent actions are symptomatic 
of a deeper problem:
the statea€™ s efforts to control the energy of animal spirits. The Chinese Dream, President Xi 
Jinpinga€™ s aspirational vision of a a€oegreat modern socialist countrya€D by 2049, could now be 
at risk. At first, it seemed
as if the authorities were concerned about a one-off personnel problem when they sent a stern 
message to the irreverent Jack Maa€!

ProvincetownaC™ s Covid Outbreak Shows a€~Ita€™ s Nowhere Near Overa€™: a€~From the 965 cases that 
scientists have traced to gatherings in Provincetown, among them 238 residents, scientists have 
drawn important
conclusions about the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has helped drive a rise in 
hospitalizations across the country, mostly among the unvaccinated. The good news is that people 
infected in Provincetown, about three-
quarters                                                                                            
  of whom were fully vaccinated, were, for the most part, not seriously ill; no deaths were 
reported, and only seven people were hospitalizeda€!

Corbin Bolies: West Virginia Guv Wanted to a€~Pee and Throw Upa€™ After Getting Briefing on Delta 
Variant'. a€~Republican Governor Jim Justicea€! made the remark Thursday during a COVID briefing, 
which he has
upped to three per week as the virus spikes once again. a€oel think I can see the enemy coming, and 
I really am hesitant to shoot or not. But I know for sure I can see the enemy coming,a€D Justice 
said. a€oeThe enemy is
this Delta variant.a€D He said he wouldna€™t impose a mask mandate or state shutdown, but, in the 
same breath, said the government should be doing more. a€oelta€™ s not time to be running through 
the streets in a
panic. This thing the next couple of weeks is probably going to get worsea€Da€!

Bob Wachter: a€™ [The] internal CDC documents^. We knew much of whata€™ s in here, but therea€™ s 
some new information & analysisa€!. The new stuffa€™ s a bit worse than I expecteda€!. 1) Delta is 
much more
infectious than the original: they estimate an Ro of 5a€“9, vs. the 2a€“3 for the original, which 
makes Delta a€oeas transmissible as chicken pox.a€Da€l. 2) They believe the period of infectivity 
is longer (high levels of
viral shedding for 18, rather than 13 days)a€!. 3) As we learned in the CDC announcement 2 days 
ago, theya€™re finding equal viral loads in noses/mouths of people with breakthrough infections as 
in infected unvaxxed
peoplea€l. 4) Vaccine efficacya€! estimatesa€! tend to show ~80% efficacy vs. Delta (vs. the prior 
95%). Thankfully vax IS still ~95% effective vs. serious infectionsa€!. 5) Lower efficacy in 
selected populations:
significantly lower efficacy (~70%) in nursing home elderly (Fig L) and in immunocompromised (Fig 
R) patientsa€!. 6) Waning of immunitya€! protection from prior infection wanes after 6 monthsa€!. 
7) Seriousness of
Delta infectionsa€!.. This document supports the a€oemore seriousa€D stance. Thata€™ s concerning. 
8) Notwithstanding all the noise about breakthrough infections, the case for vaccination remains 
enormously strong:
they show an 8-fold reduction in cases, and a 25-fold reduction in hospitalizations and deathsa€!. 
Universal masking is critical to block spread of Deltaa€“a more infectious, and possibly more 
serious virusa€“particularly if
ita€™ s true that vaccinated folks can be part of the chain of spread. Document also makes clear 
that we need a new & far more aggressive vaccination strategy (w/ everyone masking indoors until 
wea€™re there) if
wea€™re  to get ourselves out of this new & unsettling stage. The foe has gotten better at its job, 
and so the war has indeed changed.

3) As we learned in the CDC announcement 2 days ago, they're finding equal viral loads in 
noses/mouths of people with breakthrough infections as in infected unvaxxed people. Likely means 
that breakthrough cases can
spread the virus more readily than we previously thought.(5/13)

Delta variant vaccine breakthrough cases may be as
transmissible as unvaccinated cases

■ Breakthrough cases reported to national passive surveillance have lower Ct
values by 3 cycles (~10-fold increase in viral load) for Delta (Ct=18, n=19)
compared with Alpha (Ct=21, n=207) and other lineages (Ct=21, n=251)

■ Barnstable County, MA, outbreak: No difference in mean Ct values in
vaccinated and unvaccinated cases [median among vaccinated (n=80): 21.9;
unvaccinated (n=65): 21.5]

Paul Krugman: The Year & a Half When Liberty Died’. d~Id™ m wondering how Id™ 11 manage to give my 
potted version of political philosophy with a straight face. I usually teach this stuff as a 
dispute between John
Rawls and Robert Nozickd!. [For] the conservative positiond! invoke Nozickd™ s Anarchy, State, and 
Utopia which centers on the concept of freedom of choiced!. People should have the right to act as 
they like, so

long as it doesnd™ t hurt others, and this principle of freedom should prevail even if you might 
prefer that some people have more and others lessd! call[s] for a government as limited as 
possible, certainly much smaller
than the big welfare states all advanced countries currently operated!. Butd! my usual effort to 
offer maximum sympathy to the conservative position falls apart completely when one tries to make 
sense of the U.S.
rightd™ s response to Covidd“19d!. While sheer self-preservation should be a good enough reason to 
get vaccinated, refusing the shots for whatever reason is also putting other peoplesd™ lives at 
risk by keeping the

pandemic going. It has also been amazing to watch many conservatives do a complete 180 on the 
rights of business ownersd! conservative politicians trying to prohibit stores from requiring that 
their customers wear masks,
trying to prohibit cruise ships from requiring that passengers be vaccinated, and so on. All that 
rhetoric of freedom suddenly didnd™ t apply when it came to protecting public health. OK, Id™ m not 
naA“ve: Id™ ve long
argued that there are very few true libertarians in American politics, that the language of freedom 
is largely used to defend privileged!. But for all my cynicism, I didnd™ t think it would get this 
rawd!. It has been quite an
educationd!
