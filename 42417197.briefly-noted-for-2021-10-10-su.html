In the 1980s and 1990s, growing debt was a massive fear, leading people to believe that government spending and debt were out of control. The Global Financial Crisis led to a “wobble” in beliefs, but they were dismissed as no more than a temporary deviation. Covid–19 led governments around the world to run unprecedented deficits, which begs the questions: are these changes in attitudes justified, and will they last? It is clearly justified, given the extraordinary circumstances…. With the Covid–19 crisis, a war-like response was necessary…. However, the change in attitudes may pre-date the pandemic. There has been growing recognition of the need for the government to provide public goods in education, health care, research, infrastructure, and climate change that markets do not adequately supply. Heavier debts are more sustainable because of the lower interest rates around the world… Today, there are possibilities of crises that would be large enough to warrant a war-like response. Climate change, future pandemics, and unknown crises…. The U.S. is able to borrow at favorable rates, but poor behavior may preclude this in the future if the dollar grows too volatile…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUqpgYf09Vw&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUqpgYf09Vw&amp;t=1s</a>&gt;</p><div id="youtube2-OUqpgYf09Vw" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;OUqpgYf09Vw&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;1s&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OUqpgYf09Vw?start=1s&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-10-10-su?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-10-10-su?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Conor Dougherty</strong>: <em>How a Single Family Home From the 1950s Is a Vision of California’s Future</em>: ‘A single-family home from the 1950s is now a rental complex and a vision of California’s future… &lt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/business/economy/california-housing.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/business/economy/california-housing.html</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jonathan Fisher &amp; </strong><em><strong>al.</strong></em>: <em>Estimating the Marginal Propensity to Consume using the Distributions of Income, Consumption, &amp; Wealth</em>: ‘We examine the conjoint distributions… find that the overall marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.10… 0.15 for the lowest… and 0.06 for the highest quintile… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/marginal-propensity-consume/">https://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/marginal-propensity-consume/</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Wikipedia</strong>: <em>Old Shatterhand</em>: ‘Karl May… &lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Shatterhand">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Shatterhand</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jordan Schneider</strong>: <em>Invisible China: How the Urban-Rural Divide Threatens China’s Rise</em>: ‘It’s a lot easier to solve poverty for 20 million people than it is to solve the low-income problem for 900 million people… </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:35154470,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://chinatalk.substack.com/p/invisible-china-how-the-urban-rural&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:4220,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;ChinaTalk&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b5dde60-871d-48d4-9c21-e4f434b3f3c1_256x256.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Invisible China: How the Urban-Rural Divide Threatens China's Rise&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Welcome to the 37 new people who have joined us since last Monday!

Which does NOT mean there will actually be a real estate collapse in China. MacroPolo analyst Houze Song believes that the government will do what it takes to sustain the property sector, at least for a while longer…. China, unlike America in the 2000s or Japan in the 1990s, has a state-controlled banking system that will not collapse if the government does not allow it to collapse. China can bail out the banks, or simply ignore their solvency and tell them to keep lending. And those loans will sustain the economy…. But that doesn’t change the fact that China is in great danger from a real estate crash…. Here are four of the ways I think China will suffer from a real estate crash—even if there’s no severe recession. Danger #1: A shift toward even less productive assets…. Danger #2: Loss of stabilization policy…. Danger #3: Household wealth destruction…. Danger #4: Local government financing crisis…. The danger… long-term [is] a slow-motion collapse of the growth model…. That model has already undergone significant evolution, with a transition from export-led growth in the 90s and early 00s to domestic investment-led growth in the late 00s and 10s…. To transition from fast growth to slow growth without a devastating recession is quite an accomplishment. But a recession isn’t the only kind of scar that the transition can leave…</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:41804961,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/what-does-china-have-to-lose-from&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:35345,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Noahpinion&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/04281755-2cd6-42e5-a496-e69153abebb2_281x281.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;What does China have to lose from a real estate crash?&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;This is part of an ongoing series about developments in China’s real estate market.

He was very much part of a larger project with many forces at work converging to execute a coup…. The campaign wing made claims they knew to be false; these false claims were spread far and wide by the media wing (led by Tucker Carlson); the legal wing (with which Eastman was most involved) prepared theoretical arguments to justify overturning the election; the congressional wing (notably Senators like Chuck Grassley and Ted Cruz) signalled they would go along with the plan; and the extra-legal wing (the rioters of January 6) provided muscle…. The plan of course, fell apart, largely because counsel other than Eastman convinced Vice President Mike Pence that he had no right to deny certification. But it came perilously close to fruition and could provide a model for future coup attempts…. Letting Eastman get away scot-free is the equivalent of jailing low level mobsters while ignoring the people whispering in the Godfather’s ears. One viable solution is social ostracism…. He currently has ties to… Chapman University… and University of Colorado Boulder…. Although both schools said they cannot fire him without violating policies protecting academic freedom, their leaders vocally denounced his actions. Daniele Struppa, the president of Chapman, said in a&nbsp;statement&nbsp;that “Eastman’s actions are in direct opposition to the values and beliefs of our institution.” He added that he had brought “humiliation” upon the school. A&nbsp;letter&nbsp;signed by 169 Chapman faculty and members of the Board of Trustees called on the university to discipline Eastman for his role in the insurrection. Eastman subsequently resigned from Chapman…. [But] “Eastman is not only a member of the Federalist Society, the network of conservative attorneys that provided the legal scaffolding for Trumpism. He is the chairman of the organization’s Federalism &amp; Separation of Powers Practice Group and a frequent participant in its public events. The Federalist Society’s refusal to expel, condemn, or distance itself from Eastman in any way indicates that the organization is untroubled by the subversion of American democracy.” The release of the memos where Eastman advocated a scheme of anti-democratic sedition hasn’t changed his status in the Federalist Society one whit….
