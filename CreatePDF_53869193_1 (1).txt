J. Bradford DeLong (Sep. 6,2022): Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Long 20th 
Century, 1870-2010 (New York: Basic Books,) 
<https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Historv-Twentieth-Century/dp/0465019595/>:

Slouching Towards Utopia is a book in the same class as Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, & Steel or 
Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century.

The theme of Diamonda€™ s Gimsa€”a brilliant book, if not without its major flaws (and what things 
in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)a€”is: Civilizations in different 
places had access to different plant and animal resources, and for developing bio and other 
technologies two heads are better than one. Within Eurasia atthe last the Atlantic Seaboard led 
inagriculturalwealth and hence first developed the steel and the guns. Plus
Eurasians gained immunity to all the germs that jumped from Eurasian animals into humans. And 
everything else follows from those Atlantic-Seaboard differential advantages with respect to guns, 
germs, and steel.

The theme of Pikettya€™ s Capital^”a brilliant book, if not without its major flaws (and what 
things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)a€”is: Capitalists control 
enough political levers to keep the profit rate around 5%, faster than economies grow.Only  in 
exceptional eras of wars, revolutions, deep depressions, and the short 
post-WWIIsocial-democracticage of very rapid growth will wealthat the top fail to outpace wealth in
general. Hence in normal times income and wealth inequality is either already very high already or 
is rising fast. And everything else follows from that tendency toward high inequality.

The theme of Slouching Towards Utopiaa^'a brilliant book, if not without its major flaws (and what 
things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)a€”’is this:

The long 20th centurya€”the first whose history was primarily economic, with the economy not 
painted scene-backdrop but rather revolutionizing humanity's life every single generationa€” taught 
humanity expensive lessons. In 1870 industrial research labs, modern corporations, globalization, 
and the market economy a€’’which, as that genius Friedrich von Hayek most keen-sightedly observed, 
is tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutionsa€’’proved
keys to the lock that had kept humanity in its desperately poor iron cage, with the only 
comfortable ones being the thugs with spears who took from the near-subsistence farmers, and those 
with whom they shared their extractions. And previously unimaginable economic growth revolutionized 
human life over and over, generation by generation.

We should, thereafter, have straightforwardly turned our technological power and wealth to building 
something very close to a utopia: a truly human world. From 1870-2010 was 140 years. Few in 1870 
would have doubted that humanity more than ten times richer in material terms would build ourselves 
a utopia.

So what has gone wrong? Well, that idiot Friedrich von Hayek thought the unleashed market would do 
the whole job: a€oethe market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the marketa€D. 
But, as that genius Karl Polanyi put it: people will not stand for being told that there are no 
rights but property rights. They instead insist that a€oethe market was madefor man, not man for 
the marketa€D. The marketa€™ s treating those whom society saw
as equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought social explosion after explosion, blocking the 
road to utopia. They deserved communities, incomes, and stability. They needed their Polanyian 
rights to those things vindicated too.

Since 1870 humansa€’’Theodore Roosevelt, John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt, Vladimir Lenin, Margaret Thatcher, Deng Xiaoping, and othersa€” tried to think up 
solutions. They dissented from a€oethe market givetha€!a€D constructively and destructively. The 
demanded that the marketdo less, or different, and other institutions do more.
Only with a shotgun marriage of von Hayeka€™ s market to Polanyia€™ society, a marriage blessed by 
Keynesa€”a marriage that itself has so far failed its own sustainability testsa€”have we been able 
to even slouch towards utopia, and bring the El Dorado of a truly human world into view.

Whether we ever justify the full bill run up over the 140 years from 1870 to 2010 will likely 
depend on whether we remember and act upon that lesson.

Polanyi, Keynes, von Hayek:

The book wound up with a Polanyi-Left Neoliberal grand narrative:

The frozen glacial creep of economic history came to an end in 1870. The ice had been cracking 
beforehand, but as of 1870 it all melted, and the torrent began. Every single generation after 1870 
technological change was so fast that the economy revolutionized itself in a generation, and then 
did so again, every single generation, at least until 2010. (After which, a new story **may** have 
begun.) And the repeated, sequential, Schumpeterian creative-destruction
economic revolutions meant that all was solid melted into aira€”all established patterns and orders 
were steamed awaya€”and while men (and women) were not compelled to face with sober senses their 
real conditions of life and relations with one another, they did have to try to build new 
institutions to manage the problems and opportunities of production, distribution, and utilization 
that the onrushing technological cornucopia brought.

Von Hayek said that the market economy could produce unequal prosperity, but nothing more: trying 
to shape and manage it to produce social justice as well would fail, destroy prosperity, and put us 
on the road to, well, serfdom; and so the watchword had to be "the market giveth, the market taketh 
away, blessed be the name of the market".

Keynes whimpered that if only governments allowed his technocratic students to conduct a sensible 
monetary policy along with a "somewhat comprehensive" socialization of investment, that everyone 
would have a job and technology plus compound interest would wreak marvels and rock-bottom interest 
rates would "euthanize" the rentiersa€”so that they could use their money social power only at the 
cost of spending down their capital, and so relinquishing it.
Thus in the not-very-long-run, Keynesian technocrats could solve the problems of production and 
distribution, leaving humanity to grapple with its real problem: that of utilization of our wealth 
to create a truly human world.

that gave them respect and placea€”plus that you should have some power in society even if you had 
no wealth. Political economists who did not recognize this and tried to bring the stark utopia of 
market society would thus face explosions, and be overwhelmed by social-political movements that 
sought social justicea€”which might be a very inegalitarian kind of social justice, because it 
would give people not equal shares but rather what those making the
rules deserved.

The closest the whole thing came to holding together was the post-WWII era of social democracy, in 
which Keynesian focus on full employment (and low interest rates to make amortizing the WWII-era 
debt easy), Beveridgian equality-through-redistribution (and public provision), plus a little 
Pigovian externality-compensation produced the Thirty Glorious Years. But somehow social democracy 
failed its sustainability test, and was replaced by neoliberalism,
which stubbornly persists in spite of its failure to fulfill any of its promises except that it 
would make the rich much richer with much more social power.

Alternative Grand Narratives:

In the beginning, the book was going to have a number of important threads. It was to be a 
science-and-technology booka€”a Michael Polanyi book. It was going to be an 
engineers-and-entrepreneurs book. It was going to be a Schumpeterian 
creative-destruction-and-finance book. It was going to be a Keynesian macro-and-moral-philosophy 
book. And it was going to be a reacting-to-a€oeRed-Viennaa€n booka€”a Karl Polanyi-and-friends book.
Of all of these Grand Narratives that I had originally hoped to thread throughout the book, only 
the last of thesea€”the Karl Polanyi Grand Narratives’’survived the writing and editing process.

That means that my aspirations for the book have shrunk: my hope now is that my book will do for 
Karl Polanyi something like what Charlie KindlebergerS™ s Manias, Panics, and Crashes did for Hyman 
MinskyS”that is, make him comprehensible, arresting, immediate, and important, by providing lots of 
narrative examples for which the underlying theory can serve as a thematic lens.

Why are not the good people of the global north happier and more satisfied with the techno-utopian 
marvels that have been delivered to them? Why has great wealth in historical perspective produced 
not reduced but increased economic anxiety? And how does that economic anxiety get transformed into 
ethno-nationalist fear and rage? And how is it that the neoliberal ordering of society still 
survives, given that it has fulfilled exactly none of the promises made
by its original salesmen, save for making the rich richer and society more economically unequal?

Start with the metaphor of the economic pie, and with the society-scale problems of baking, slicing 
and tasting. First you have a bake a large-enough pieS”a pie so that there is potentially enough 
for all. Then you have to slice the pieS”so everyone gets their share. Then people have to taste 
the pieS”use their material resources to live a good lifeS”be healthy, safe, secure, and happy.

Before 1870 the human technological level and ability to harvest natural resources was low relative 
to our population. Humanity could not even bake a large-enough pie. After 1870 things changed. 
Advancing science, turned into technology by industrial research labs, deployed at scale by modern 
corporations, and then diffused throughout the world by that magnificent crowdsourcing mechanism 
that is the market economy solved the problem of baking what
every previous era would have seen as enough. AndS”since they saw the baking as the hard 
problemS”they would be very surprised to see that the problems of slicing and tasting have 
flummoxed us. They would expect us to live in utopia, as we manifestly do not.

My Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the 20th Century is about how we solved the 
problem of baking the pieS”and how we fumbled the solution to the problems of slicing and tasting. 
That is its big narrative sweep, with lots of subthreads, digressions, and anecdotes along the way.

What happened? This, I think, my book has nailed. Letting the market economy rip to solve the 
problem of making enough had consequences. You see, the only rights the market economy recognizes 
are property rights; and the only gospel it preaches is "the market giveth; the market taketh away: 
blessed be the name of the market".
People will not, and did not, stand for that. They demand, instead: Seethe market was made for man; 
not man for the marketa€D.

Perhaps humanity, came close to an institutional-societal setup to tackle the problems of slicing 
and tasting. Post-WWII "social democracy" in the rich countries was a good try. But social 
democracy failed its sustainability test: society may not know what "social justice" is, but it 
knows that it manifestly does not consist of giving benefits to and making life easy for those it 
calls "undeserving".
And so the wheel turned. Here we are. Our current situation: in the rich countries there is enough 
by any reasonable standard, and yet we are all unhappy, all earnestly seeking to discover who the 
enemies are who have somehow stolen our rich birthright and fed us unappetizing lentil stew 
instead.

What do we do next? This my book punts. That is for a younger generation than my failed one to 
decide. Global warming, ethno-national terrorism on all scales from the individual AR-15 to the 
Combined Arms Army, revived fascism, technokleptocracya€”I quail.

As John Maynard Keynes wrote back in 1924: a€oe[That] assumes... a plan exists.... [But] we lack 
more than usual a coherent scheme of progress, a tangible ideal. All the political parties alike 
have their origins in past ideas and not in new ideas.... No one has a gospel. The next move is 
with the head...a€D

Before 1870 humanity had thought the big problem was that limited technology and natural resources 
relative to population kept there from being enough. We simply could not bake a large-enough pie. 
Half of the big story of the twentieth century is of overcoming that constraint^”the pie can now be 
bakeda€”but, somehow, that did not bring us to utopia. Slicing and tasting the pie proved much 
harder problems than earlier ages had thought: today, having

enough remains out-of-reach for most of humanity; and those of us with enough have a hard time 
properly tasting it. Look around: many (most?) of us do not look healthy, safe, secure, or happy.

Friedrich von Hayek saw clearly that the market economy, when coupled with industrial research 
labs, modern corporations, and globalization, was the key to unlocking the cage keeping humanity 
desperately poor. He thus preached the gospel: a€oethe market giveth, the market taketh away: 
blessed be the name of the market.a€D But, as Karl Polanyi saw, humans needed more rights than just 
property rights. The marketa€™ s treating those whom society saw
as equals unequally, or those whom it saw as unequals equally, brought social explosion after 
explosion, blocking the road to utopia.

Not a€oeblessed be the name of the marketa€D but a€oethe market was made for man, not man for the 
marketa€D was required But how? During the post-WWII North-Atlantic shotgun marriage of Friedrich 
von Hayek to Karl Polanyi blessed by John Maynard Keynesa€”what we called a€oesocial 
democracya€Da€”was humanity able to even slouch towards utopia. But that marriage failed its own 
sustainability test: it ran into the buzzsaw of the neoliberal
challenge in the 1980s. And the neoliberal order has been stubbornly and persistently resistant to 
erosion in spite of its own many, many failed promises.

Slicing and tasting the pie ought to be problems as solvable as baking the pie turned out to be. 
But not so. The second half of the big story of the twentieth century is that very painful one. And 
is slicing and tasting even possible?

As Richard Easterlin wrote a generation ago, humanitya€™ s is a a€oehollow victorya€Q a€oeln the 
end, the triumph of economic growth is not a triumph of humanity over material wants; rather, it is 
a triumph of material wants over humanitya€!a€D

And as John Maynard Keynes wrote a century ago: a€oeWe lack, more than usual, a coherent scheme of 
progress, a tangible ideal. All the political parties alike have their origins in past ideas and 
not in new ideas.... It is not necessary to debate the subtleties of what justifies a man in 
promoting his gospel by force; for no one has a gospel. The next move is with the head, and fists 
must wait...a€D

2022-06-04:

Before our modern age, human technological knowledge crept forward at only the pace of a glacier. A 
typical century would see technology advance by little. Perhaps the the population at the end of 
the century could have lived 5% better than those at the starta€”if the population had stayed the 
same. But Malthusian forces were dominant. The only way for women to have durable social power was 
to be the mothers of surviving sons, and even with high fertility
more than a quarter saw all their sons die, so better nutrition would lead them to try harder. Thus 
the population grew by 10% in an average century, and so smaller farm sizes offset better 
technology and kept the real income of the typical human much the same. And so human psychology, 
human sociology, and human polities stayed much the same, with substantial changes visible only if 
one took the long-duration viewpoint of millennia.

This frozen glacial creep of economic history came to an end in 1870. The ice had been cracking 
beforehand, over 1500 to 1870. But after 1870 saw the roaring of the cataract. In every single 
generation after 1870 technological change was so fast and the seizing of opportunities by the 
market economy so rapid that the economy revolutionized itself in a generation, and then did so 
again, every single generation. This was the story at least until 2010. (After which,
a new story may have begun.)

Te repeated, sequential, Schumpeterian creative-destruction economic revolutions meant that all was 
solid melted into aira€”all established patterns and orders were steamed awaya€”and while men (and 
women) were not compelled to face with sober senses their real conditions of life and relations 
with one another, they did have to try to build new institutions to manage the problems and 
opportunities of production, distribution, and utilization that the
onrushing technological cornucopia brought.

Friedrich von Hayek said that the market economy could produce unequal prosperity, but nothing 
more: trying to shape and manage it to produce social justice as well would fail, destroy 
prosperity, and put us on the road to, well, serfdom; and so the watchword had to be "the market 
giveth, the market taketh away, blessed be the name of the market".

John Maynard Keynes whimpered that if only governments allowed his technocratic students to conduct 
a sensible monetary policy along with a "somewhat comprehensive" socialization of investment, that 
everyone would have a job and technology plus compound interest would wreak marvels and rock-bottom 
interest rates would "euthanize" the rentiersa€”so that they could use their money social power 
only at the cost of spending down their capital, and so
relinquishing it. Thus in the not-very-long-run, Keynesian technocrats could solve the problems of 
production and distribution, leaving humanity to grapple with its real problem: that of utilization 
of our wealth to create a truly human world.

Karl Polanyi said that the "stark utopia" of von Hayek's market was unsustainable: the only rights 
it recognized were property rights and your own source of social power was your wealth, but people 
thought that they had other, more important, rights that society needed to vindicated ”to economic 
security, to an income level proportional to what they deserved, and that other people should have 
income levels proportional to what they deserved too, in a
connected society that gave them respect and placed’’plus that you should have some power in 
society even if you had no wealth. Political economists who did not recognize this and tried to 
bring the stark utopia of market society would thus face explosions, and be overwhelmed by 
social-political movements that sought social justiced’’which might be a very inegalitarian kind of 
social justice indeed, because it would give people not equal shares but rather
what those making the rules deserved.

The closest the whole thing came to holding together was the post-WWII era of social democracy, in 
which Keynesian focus on full employment (and low interest rates to make amortizing the WWII-era

which stubbornly persists in spite of its failure to fulfill any of its promises except that it 
would make the rich much richer with much more social power.

2022-06-11:

The long 20th century was the first whose history was primarily economic, with the economy not 
painted scene-backdrop but rather revolutionizing humanity's life every single generation with 
massive, creative and destructive, utopian and immiserating upward leaps in technology-driven 
productivity. Before 1870 humanity had thought that the big problem was that it could not bake a 
big enough pie: given limited technology and natural resources relative to
population, human production could not be large enough for everyone to have enough. In the long 
twentieth century that constraint fell away. The pie could be baked. But better technology did not 
help solve the problems of slicing and tasting the pie: as of today, having enough remains 
out-of-reach for most of humanity. And those with enough have a hard time properly tasting it: many 
(most?) of them do not look healthy, safe, secure, and happy.

Only when the political-economic order was the post-WWII North-Atlantic social-democratic shotgun 
marriage of Friedrich von Hayek to Karl Polanyi, a marriage blessed by John Maynard Keynesa€”a 
marriage that itself has failed its own sustainability tests when it ran into the buzzsaw of the 
neoliberal challenge in the 1980sa€”has humanity been able to even slouch towards utopia. The 
explosion of our science and technological competence ought to have
made our birthright. Yet we have, in many aspects, sold it for thin red-lentil stew.

Friedrich von Hayeka€”a genius, in some waysa€”was the one who most keen-sightedly observed that 
the market economy is tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutions. The market economy, plus 
industrial research labs, modern corporations, and globalization, were keys to the cage keeping 
humanity desperately poor. Hayek drew from this the conclusion: a€oethe market giveth, the market 
taketh away: blessed be the name of the market,a€D And he
said that attitude was necessary to grasp as much of utopia as humanity could grasp. But humans 
disagreed. As genius Karl Polanyi saw, humans needed more rights than just property rights. The 
marketa€™ s treating those whom society saw as equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought 
social explosion after explosion, blocking the road to utopia.

Not a€oeblessed be the name of the marketa€D but a€oethe market was made for man, not man for the 
marketa€D was required if humanity was to even slouch towards the utopia that we ought to grasp 
with our technology. But how? Since 1870 humansa€”John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Vladimir 
Lenin, and many othersa€”have tried solutions, demanding that the market do less, or different, and 
other institutions do more, or other. Only
government, tamed government, focusing and rebalancing things to secure more and different rights 
for more citizens, have brought the El Dorado of a truly human world into view. If electorates 
could choose such governments, slicing and tasting the pie ought to be problems as solvable as 
baking the pie turned out to be. But the twentieth century taught usa€’’painfullya€’’that that is 
not easy. And is it even possible?

As John Maynard Keynes wrote way back in 1924:

We lack, more than usual a coherent scheme of progress, a tangible ideal.... It is not necessary to 
debate the subtleties of what justifies a man in promoting his gospel by force; for no one has a 
gospel. The next move is with the head, and fists must wait...

Self-Struggle Session:

The book is only possible because it has a straightforward Grand Narrative at its heart. But that 
means that the book is also inadequate because it has an overly-simplistic Grtand Narrative at its 
heart. The Grand Narrative is a stripped-down pseudo-Polanyiesque obe. That may have been adequate 
for a 1940s understanding of the dynamic of fascism, really-existing socialism, and classical (or, 
rather, pseudo-classical semi-) liberalism then. But it is wholly
inadequate for grasping the political-economy dilemmas of the world today!

At the very least, a satisfactory book would deal:

1. with the role played by the fiduciary institution of modern science (a la Michael Polanyi) and 
the failed attempts to extend that into technocracy;

2. with the fine-grained advance of technology, an engineers-and-entrepreneurs book (a la David 
Landes and his The Unbound Prometheus)',

3. with the interaction of technology and the creation of businesses and industries (and 
destruction of same) (a la Joseph Schumpeter);

4. with the construction of institutions that were truly liberal and democratic as attempts to 
approximate what an open society (a la Karl Popper's hopes) might turn out to be; Michael Polanyi 
book;

Friedrich von Hayek saw clearly that the market economy, when coupled with industrial research 
labs, modern corporations, and globalization, was the key to unlocking the cage keeping humanity 
desperately poor. He thus preached the gospel: a€oethe market giveth, the market taketh away: 
blessed be the name of the market.a€D But, as Karl Polanyi saw, humans needed more rights than just 
property rights. The marketa€™ s treating those whom society saw
as equals unequally, or those whom it saw as unequals equally, brought social explosion after 
explosion, blocking the road to utopia.

Not a€oeblessed be the name of the marketaGD but a€oethe market was made for man, not man for the 
marketa€D was required But how? During the post-WWII North-Atlantic shotgun marriage of Friedrich 
von Hayek to Karl Polanyi blessed by John Maynard Keynesa€”what we called a€oesocial 
democracya€Da€”was humanity able to even slouch towards utopia. But that marriage failed its own 
sustainability test: it ran into the buzzsaw of the neoliberal
challenge in the 1980s. And the neoliberal order has been stubbornly and persistently resistant to 
erosion in spite of its own many, many failed promises.

Slicing and tasting the pie ought to be problems as solvable as baking the pie turned out to be. 
But not so. The second half of the big story of the twentieth century is that very painful one. And 
is slicing and tasting even possible?

As Richard Easterlin wrote a generation ago, humanitya€™ s is a a€oehollow victorya€Q a€oeln the 
end, the triumph of economic growth is not a triumph of humanity over material wants; rather, it is 
a triumph of material wants over humanitya€!a€D

And as John Maynard Keynes wrote a century ago: a€oeWe lack, more than usual, a coherent scheme of 
progress, a tangible ideal. All the political parties alike have their origins in past ideas and 
not in new ideas.... It is not necessary to debate the subtleties of what justifies a man in 
promoting his gospel by force; for no one has a gospel. The next move is with the head, and fists 
must wait...a€D

Before our modern age, human technological knowledge crept forward at only the pace of a glacier. A 
typical century would see technology advance by little. Perhaps the the population at the end of 
the century could have lived 5% better than those at the starta€”if the population had stayed the 
same. But Malthusian forces were dominant. The only way for women to have durable social power was 
to be the mothers of surviving sons, and even with high fertility
more than a quarter saw all their sons die, so better nutrition would lead them to try harder. Thus 
the population grew by 10% in an average century, and so smaller farm sizes offset better 
technology and kept the real income of the typical human much the same. And so human psychology, 
human sociology, and human polities stayed much the same, with substantial changes visible only if 
one took the long-duration viewpoint of millennia.

This frozen glacial creep of economic history came to an end in 1870. The ice had been cracking 
beforehand, over 1500 to 1870. But after 1870 saw the roaring of the cataract. In every single 
generation after 1870 technological change was so fast and the seizing of opportunities by the 
market economy so rapid that the economy revolutionized itself in a generation, and then did so 
again, every single generation. This was the story at least until 2010. (After which,
a new story may have begun.)

Te repeated, sequential, Schumpeterian creative-destruction economic revolutions meant that all was 
solid melted into aira€”all established patterns and orders were steamed awaya€”and while men (and 
women) were not compelled to face with sober senses their real conditions of life and relations 
with one another, they did have to try to build new institutions to manage the problems and 
opportunities of production, distribution, and utilization that the
onrushing technological cornucopia brought.

Friedrich von Hayek said that the market economy could produce unequal prosperity, but nothing 
more: trying to shape and manage it to produce social justice as well would fail, destroy 
prosperity, and put us on the road to, well, serfdom; and so the watchword had to be "the market 
giveth, the market taketh away, blessed be the name of the market".

John Maynard Keynes whimpered that if only governments allowed his technocratic students to conduct 
a sensible monetary policy along with a "somewhat comprehensive" socialization of investment, that 
everyone would have a job and technology plus compound interest would wreak marvels and rock-bottom 
interest rates would "euthanize" the rentiersa€”so that they could use their money social power 
only at the cost of spending down their capital, and so
relinquishing it. Thus in the not-very-long-run, Keynesian technocrats could solve the problems of 
production and distribution, leaving humanity to grapple with its real problem: that of utilization 
of our wealth to create a truly human world.

Karl Polanyi said that the "stark utopia" of von Hayek's market was unsustainable: the only rights 
it recognized were property rights and your own source of social power was your wealth, but people 
thought that they had other, more important, rights that society needed to vindicated ”to economic 
security, to an income level proportional to what they deserved, and that other people should have 
income levels proportional to what they deserved too, in a
connected society that gave them respect and placed’’plus that you should have some power in 
society even if you had no wealth. Political economists who did not recognize this and tried to 
bring the stark utopia of market society would thus face explosions, and be overwhelmed by 
social-political movements that sought social justiced’’which might be a very inegalitarian kind of 
social justice indeed, because it would give people not equal shares but rather
what those making the rules deserved.

The closest the whole thing came to holding together was the post-WWII era of social democracy, in 
which Keynesian focus on full employment (and low interest rates to make amortizing the WWII-era 
debt easy), Beveridgian equality-through-redistribution (and public provision), plus a little 
Pigovian externality-compensation produced the Thirty Glorious Years. But somehow social democracy 
failed its sustainability test, and was replaced by neoliberalism,
which stubbornly persists in spite of its failure to fulfill any of its promises except that it 
would make the rich much richer with much more social power.

2022-06-11:

The long 20th century was the first whose history was primarily economic, with the economy not 
painted scene-backdrop but rather revolutionizing humanity's life every single generation with 
massive, creative and destructive, utopian and immiserating upward leaps in technology-driven 
productivity. Before 1870 humanity had thought that the big problem was that it could not bake a 
big enough pie: given limited technology and natural resources relative to
population, human production could not be large enough for everyone to have enough. In the long 
twentieth century that constraint fell away. The pie could be baked. But better technology did not 
help solve the problems of slicing and tasting the pie: as of today, having enough remains 
out-of-reach for most of humanity. And those with enough have a hard time properly tasting it: many 
(most?) of them do not look healthy, safe, secure, and happy.

Only when the political-economic order was the post-WWII North-Atlantic social-democratic shotgun 
marriage of Friedrich von Hayek to Karl Polanyi, a marriage blessed by John Maynard Keynesa€”a 
marriage that itself has failed its own sustainability tests when it ran into the buzzsaw of the 
neoliberal challenge in the 1980sa€”has humanity been able to even slouch towards utopia. The 
explosion of our science and technological competence ought to have
made our birthright. Yet we have, in many aspects, sold it for thin red-lentil stew.

Friedrich von Hayeka€”a genius, in some waysa€”was the one who most keen-sightedly observed that 
the market economy is tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutions. The market economy, plus 
industrial research labs, modern corporations, and globalization, were keys to the cage keeping 
humanity desperately poor. Hayek drew from this the conclusion: a€oethe market giveth, the market 
taketh away: blessed be the name of the market ,a€D And he
said that attitude was necessary to grasp as much of utopia as humanity could grasp. But humans 
disagreed. As genius Karl Polanyi saw, humans needed more rights than just property rights. The 
marketa€™ s treating those whom society saw as equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought 
social explosion after explosion, blocking the road to utopia.

Not a€oeblessed be the name of the marketaGD but a€oethe market was made for man, not man for the 
marketa€D was required if humanity was to even slouch towards the utopia that we ought to grasp 
with our technology. But how? Since 1870 humansa€”John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Vladimir 
Lenin, and many othersa€”have tried solutions, demanding that the market do less, or different, and 
other institutions do more, or other. Only
government, tamed government, focusing and rebalancing things to secure more and different rights 
for more citizens, have brought the El Dorado of a truly human world into view. If electorates 
could choose such governments, slicing and tasting the pie ought to be problems as solvable as 
baking the pie turned out to be. But the twentieth century taught usa€’’painfully a€’’that that is 
not easy. And is it even possible?

As John Maynard Keynes wrote way back in 1924:

We lack, more than usual a coherent scheme of progress, a tangible ideal.... It is not necessary to 
debate the subtleties of what justifies a man in promoting his gospel by force; for no one has a 
gospel. The next move is with the head, and fists must wait...

Self-Struggle Session:

The book is only possible because it has a straightforward Grand Narrative at its heart. But that 
means that the book is also inadequate because it has an overly-simplistic Grtand Narrative at its 
heart. The Grand Narrative is a stripped-down pseudo-Polanyiesque obe. That may have been adequate 
for a 1940s understanding of the dynamic of fascism, really-existing socialism, and classical (or, 
rather, pseudo-classical semi-) liberalism then. But it is wholly
inadequate for grasping the political-economy dilemmas of the world today!

At the very least, a satisfactory book would deal:

1. with the role played by the fiduciary institution of modern science (a la Michael Polanyi) and 
the failed attempts to extend that into technocracy;

2. with the fine-grained advance of technology, an engineers-and-entrepreneurs book (a la David 
Landes and his The Unbound Prometheus)',

3. with the interaction of technology and the creation of businesses and industries (and 
destruction of same) (a la Joseph Schumpeter);

4. with the construction of institutions that were truly liberal and democratic as attempts to 
approximate what an open society (a la Karl Popper's hopes) might turn out to be; Michael Polanyi 
book;

5. with macroeconomics and moral philosophy in the mode of John Maynard Keynes;

6. with managerialism (a la Peter Drucker but also Alasdair MacIntyre) as an attempt to reconcile 
individual freedom with community purpose;

7. with taming the market via wealth equalization and public provision (a la William Beveridge);

8. with Coasian hopes to make the market sovereign by carving property rights properly at the 
joints;

9. with Pigovian realities that prohibit such carving;

10. with a much deeper dive at the failure of social democracy (under the trinity of Keynesian full 
employment and rentier-euthanasia, Pigovian externality correction, and Beveridgean redistribution) 
to pass its own sustainability test under pressure from the neoliberal challenge;

11. with a much deeper dive into the extraordinary persistence of neoliberalism in spite of its 
failure to keep any of its promises about how it was going to promote the public good';

12. and, last, with a€oeRed Viennaa€D and the reactions to ita€”as monarchy met aristocracy, 
cosmopolitanism met nationalism, reason met irrationality, the avant garde met classicism, 
socialism met the bourgeoisie, all in one industrial-financial-cultural-bureaucratic 
eastern-European capital citya€”a a€oeKarl Polanyi, Sigmund Freud, and friendsa€D book.
That is twelve different grand narrative frames, each of which could underpin an economic history 
of the long 20th century. Plus there are all of the frames that can underpin the history of the 
short 20th centurya€”and have, in books by thinkers from Eric Hobsbawm to John Lukacs.

The "what is to be done?" message of my book is, to the extent that there is one, "double-down on 
social democracy". But that did not work in the 1970s, is unlikely to work now, and yet the book 
cannot suggest a better path because of its inadequate pseudo-Polanyiesque Grand Narrative frame.
