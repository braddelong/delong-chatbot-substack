a€\Cochranea€™ s declaration^ ” made at a time when the share of the U.S. labor force in 
construction was below its long-run average and had been below its long-run average for fifteen 
monthsa€”that: a€oewe should have a recession. People who spend their lives pounding nails in 
Nevada need something else to do.a€EJNo recognition at all that the structural-adjustment 
climb-down from the housing boom had already taken place.
No recognition that structural adjustment takes place by pulling people into high-value jobs, not 
by pushing them out of low-value jobs into zero-value non-jobs. No recognition at all:

John Lippert (2008a€“12a€“23): Bloomberg'. a€~John Cochrane was steaming as word of U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Henry Paulsona€™ s plan to buy $700 billion in troubled mortgage assets rippled across 
the University of Chicago in September. Cochrane had been teaching at the bastion of free-market 
economics for 14 years and this struck at everything that hea€”and the schoola€’’stood for. a€oeWe 
all wandered the hallway thinking,
How could this possibly make sense?a€D says Cochrane, 51, recalling his incredulity at Paulsona€™ s 
attempt to prop up the mortgage industry and the banks that had precipitated the housing marketa€™ 
s boom and bust.

During a lunch held on a balcony with a view of Rockefeller Memorial Chapel, Cochrane, son-in-law 
of Chicago efficient-market theorist Eugene Fama, and some colleagues made their stand. They wrote 
a petition attacking Paulsona€™ s proposal, sent it to economists nationwide and collected 230 
signatures. Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama waved the document as he scorned the 
rescue. When Congress rejected it on Sept.
29, Cochrane fired off congratulatory e-mails. The victory was short-lived. Lawmakers approved the 
plan four days later, swayed by what Cochrane calls a pinata of pork-barrel amendments.

At the University of Chicago, once ascendant free-market acolytes are finding themselves in an 
unusual role: Theya€™re battling a wave of government intervention more sweeping than any since the 
Great Depression as the U.S. struggles with the worst recession in seven decades. By the end of 
November, the government had committed $8.5 trillion, or more than half the value of everything 
produced in the country in 2007, to save the
financial system. The European Union had ponied up more than $3 trillion to guarantee bank loans 
and provide capital to lenders. And China had unveiled a $586 billion stimulus plan and its biggest 
interest-rate cut in 11 years.

The intrusion is anathema to the so-called Chicago School of economics and its patriarch, the late 
Milton Friedman. For half a century, Chicagoa€™ s hands-off principles have permeated financial 
thinking and shaped global markets, earning the university 10 Nobel Memorial Prizes in Economic 
Sciences starting in 1969, more than double the four each won by Columbia University, Harvard 
University, Princeton University and the
University of California, Berkeley. Chicagoa€™ s laissez-faire imprint underpins everything from 
U.S. President Ronald Reagana€™ s 1981 tax cuts and the fall of communism that decade to 
quantitative investment strategies. In 1972, Friedman helped persuade U.S. Treasury Secretary 
George Shultz, former dean of Chicagoa€™ s business school, to approve the first financial futures 
contracts in foreign currencies. Such derivatives grew
more complex after Chicago economists created the mathematical formulas to price them, helping 
spawn a $683 trillion market thata€™ s proved to be a root of today a€™ s financial system 
breakdown. On Dec. 16, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its target lending rate to as low as zero for 
the first time and said it will buy mortgage- backed securities.

Friedman, who died in 2006 at age 94, defined the Chicago School in 1974 as he spoke to a board of 
trustees dinner. a€oea€~Chicagoa€™ stands for a belief in the efficacy of the free market as a 
means of organizing resources, for skepticism about government intervention into economic affairs 
,a€D he said. Friedman was explaining a movement that had taken hold in the U.S. and was 
percolating in Europe and South America. a€oeBy the
mida€“1970s, there was a whole generation in government and academia whoa€™ d trained at Chicago or 
places influenced by it,a€D says Ross Emmett, a Michigan State University professor whoa€™ s 
written three books on the school. Today, 10 percent of Chicago undergraduates study economics. 
Alumni of Chicagoa€™ s graduate business school, now called the Booth School of Business, run 
states and companies. Jon Corzine, the
former chief executive officer of Goldman, Sachs & Co. who earned his MBA in 1973, is governor of 
New Jersey. Peter Peterson, who graduated with an MBA in 1951, co-founded Blackstone Group LP, the 
worlda€™ s largest private equity firm. David Booth, a 1971 MBA graduate for whom the school is now 
named, donated $300 million in November, the largest endowment given to the university.

Alumni of Chicagoa€™ s graduate business school, now called the Booth School of Business, run 
states and companies. Jon Corzine, the
former chief executive officer of Goldman, Sachs & Co. who earned his MBA in 1973, is governor of 
New Jersey. Peter Peterson, who graduated with an MBA in 1951, co-founded Blackstone Group LP, the 
worlda€™ s largest private equity firm. David Booth, a 1971 MBA graduate for whom the school is now 
named, donated $300 million in November, the largest endowment given to the university.

Booth, who founded Dimensional Fund Advisors Inc., bases his funds on Famaa€™ s theory that a 
market digests information affecting prices so well that even professional investors cana€™ t 
outsmart it for long. Even with his U.S. Micro Cap Portfolio fund down 40 percent in 2008 through 
Dec. 22, Booth says quantitative investing is less vulnerable during a slump than stock picking 
that relies on human judgment. a€oeThis supports
our theory in that predicting the market is even more difficult than we expected,a€D he says. 
Unlike Booth, 62, much of the academic world is reassessing Chicago School hallmarks. Thata€™ s 
true even in the limestone buildings on the 211-acre (85-hectare) Hyde Park campus in which 
professors teach Friedmana€™ s theories.

On Oct. 14, about 250 students and professors debated an administration-backed plan for a $200 
million research center to be named for Friedman. The protesters argued that the institute would 
enshrine policies that have brought economies near collapse. a€oeWhen Friedmana€™ s Platonic ideas 
of free-market virtues are put into practice, they have too often generated a systemic orgy of 
competitive greed a€“ whose remedies, ironically,
entail countermeasures of nationalization,a€D Marshall Sahlins, an emeritus professor of 
anthropology, said during the debate, speaking in a room adorned with murals of female students 
parading through the campus in medieval gowns. Sahlins, 77, noted a few weeks later socialist and 
capitalist countries alike are regulating or nationalizing financial institutions in a rebuff to 
Friedman. Off campus, the global meltdown is stirring anti­
Chicago economists, who were voices in the wilderness during decades of lax government oversight of 
markets. Joseph Stiglitz, who won one of Columbiaa€™ s economics Nobels, says the approach of 
Friedman and his followers helped cause todaya€™ s turmoil.

a€oeThe Chicago School bears the blame for providing a seeming intellectual foundation for the idea 
that markets are self- adjusting and the best role for government is to do nothing,a€D says 
Stiglitz, 65, who received his Nobel in 2001. University of Texas economist James Galbraith says 
Friedmana€™ s ideology has run its course. He says hands-off policies were convenient for American 
capitalists after World War II as they vied with
government-favored labor unions at home and Soviet expansion overseas. a€oeThe inability of 
Friedmana€™ s successors to say anything useful about whata€™ s happening in financial markets 
today means their influence is finished,a€D he says. Instead, Galbraith, 56, says policy-makers are 
rediscovering the ideas of his father, Harvard professor John Kenneth Galbraith, and economist John 
Maynard Keynes of the University of
Cambridge. Keynes, who died in 1946, argued that governments should spend to combat the 
unemployment that free markets tolerate. Galbraith, who died in 2006, rejected mathematical models 
and technical analyses as divorced from realitya€I.

Already, some of the universitya€™ s top economists have abandoned hard-line Friedmanism for the 
middle ground. Douglas Diamond, a finance professor at Chicago since 1979, declined to sign 
Cochranea€™ s petition damning Paulsona€™ s bailout. Diamond says he knew the Sept. 29 vote against 
the rescue would spur investors to pull assets from banks. He says governments have no choice but 
to provide safety nets for banks and
tougher oversight. a€oeThe vote was the beginning of people believing crazy stuff, like the U.S. 
might find it politically expedient to let its financial system go,a€D Diamond, 55, says.

Robert Lucas, a Chicago economist who won a Nobel in 1995 for a theory that argued against 
governments trying to fine-tune consumer demand, says deregulation may have gone too far. 
Depression-era laws that separated commercial and investment banks helped depositors decide if they 
wanted secure accounts or riskier investments. Today, without these distinctions, people cana€™ t 
be sure if their investments, or those of their
customers, are safe. a€oela€™ m changing my views on bank regulation every week,a€D Lucas, 71, 
says. a€oelt was an area I saw as under control. Now I dona€™ t believe that.a€D Lucas says he 
voted for Obama, the only Democrat besides Bill Clinton hea€™ d supported in 44 years. He concluded 
the candidate was comfortable talking with professional economists. He describes Goolsbee, whom he 
has met in faculty workshops, as a
serious scholara€l.

The university got its start in 1892 as a haven for researchers, not would-be managers. William 
Rainey Harper, a Bible scholar who taught at Yale, attracted oil magnate John D. Rockefeller as his 
benefactor. Harper broke with then prevailing Ivy League practices by hiring Jews, finance 
professor Fama says. By 1946, Chicago was luring stars such as Enrico Fermi, father of the 
self-sustaining nuclear reaction. Friedmana€™ s parents were
Jews who emigrated from whata€™ s now Ukraine. When he joined the faculty in 1946, he allied with 
Friedrich Hayek, a London School of Economics professor who later transferred to Chicago. They 
sought to discredit Keynes, who argued that deficits in government budgets could revive demand in 
recessions. They viewed rising government power as a step toward left-wing totalitarianism and 
wanted to stop it, says Philip Mirowski, a
University of Notre Dame economista€l.

Fama, 69, who favors casual shirts and chinos on campus, joined the Chicago faculty in 1963. When 
he opened his financial theory class on Sept. 29, the day Congress voted down Paulsona€™ s bailout, 
he placed efficient-market equations from his 1976 textbook on an overhead projector. Fama says he 
never denied the possibility of unexpected events even though hea€™ d spent a lifetime showing that 
markets effectively digest
information. He was stunned that American International Group Inc., once the worlda€™ s largest 
insurer, sold $441 billion in unhedged and undercapitalized insurance on securitized debt, much of 
it tied to mortgage values. a€oeNo one expected a player like AIG to take a long position and not 
hedge themselves,a€D Fama says. He says the government may have been able to stabilize the U.S. 
financial system at a lower cost by letting
AIG collapse.
