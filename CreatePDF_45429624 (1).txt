How should economists be changing what they do?

Diane Coyle: Cogs & Monsters'. d~This book reflects my frustration with the straw men arguments 
[against economists]a€!. They have allowed economists to overlook or deny some things that are 
badly wrong with the disciplined!.

• The extent to which economicsd”specifically financial economics in this cased’’actually shapes 
the world rather than just analysing it.

• How hard it is to analyse the society you are part of, looking particularly at macroeconomicsd!.

•  The need for economists, especially those working in policy roles, to take more account of the 
way their own actions change the economyd! by shaping a climate of ideas that affects norms of 
behaviour.

•  Acceptance thatd! while we should always aim to be impartial and evidence-based, economists are 
themselves powerful, and yet often unaccountable, political actorsd!.

•  Finally, the need to assemble the building blocks available in much existing economic research 
into a benchmark framework appropriate to the digital economy, and to provide suitable policy tools 
reflecting the framework.


It will be apparent that I do not think that this [last] shift is much in evidence, even though 
there are indeed building blocks available, particularly in sub-fields such as industrial 
organisation and market design, information economics, or growth theory. However, although the 
blocks are there, they have not been assembled into a consistent structure and above all do not
address the welfare economics questions. Nor are there the kinds of models, tools, and rules of 
thumb needed to translate these insights into the classroom and the offices of policy analystsa€!.

I am convinced that a changed a€~mainstreama€™ paradigm is needed and will emerge. The reason? 
Events. Digital technologiesa€!. Globalisationa€! technologiesa€!. The dual hit of the 2008 
financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus crisisa€i. It is surprising that so little changed in the 
way the globaleconomy has operated after the shock of 2008a€“2009. It may well
turn out that, like a cartoon character that continues running for a while beyond the edge of the 
cliff, the consequences were yet to come. The two shocks combined cannot fail to have a lasting 
effect, just as the Depression and the Second World War did almost a century agoa€!

I find myself not so sure and not so optimistic as Diane: it took World War I, a failure to restore 
gold-standard stability and growth in the following decade, the Great Depression, and World War 
IIa€”all four of thema€”to knock the world out of the pseudo-classical (because it was, in fact, 
not old but quite new)semi-liberal (because a greatmany people were deprived of their freedom, and a
great deal of social power went not to the lucky and the entrepreneurial who were rewarded by the 
market but remained in the hands of semi-hereditary elites) order that it had been in before World 
War I.

All four were shocks that together prepared the soil for the post-WWII Age of Social Democracy that 
would follow, for the Thirty Glorious Years. Those were four big shocksa€’’bigger than the ones we 
have had.

And then that Age of Social Democracy proved unsustainable: a relatively small (by our standards) 
productivity slowdown, a relatively small (by our standards) episode of high unemployment, and a 
decade of non-hyperinflation knocked the world economy knocked us from the Age of Social Democracy 
into the Age of Neoliberalism.
a€oeThe market giveth; the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the marketa€D as an 
ideological formation buttressing semi-hereditary and status-based elites in the name of economic 
efficiency has proven to be a very strong factor in world history indeed. Keynes argued against it 
in the mid-1920s:

John Maynard Keynes: The End ofLaissez-Faire\ a€~Many elements have contributed to the current 
intellectual biasa€!. To suggest social action for the public good to the City of London is like 
discussing the Origin of Species with a bishop sixty years agoa€!. The lethargic monstera€! has 
ruled over us rather by hereditary right than by personal merita€!. Let us
cleara€!. It is not true that individuals possess a prescriptive 'natural liberty' in their 
economic activities. There is no 'compact' conferring perpetual rights on those who Have or on 
those who Acquire. The world is not so governed from above that private and social interest always 
coincide. It is not so managed here below that in practice they coincide. It is not a correct
deduction from the principles of economics that enlightened self-interest always operates in the 
public interest. Nor is it true that self-interest generally is enlightened; more often individuals 
acting separately to promote their own ends are too ignorant or too weak to attain even these. 
Experience does not show that individuals, when they make up a social unit, are always
less clear-sighted than when they act separatelya€!

Thus I am markedly less optimistic than is Diane, not about economicsa€”the state of economics, at 
least where I sit here in Berkeley, is very, very good. And we are, retirement by retirement, and 
RCT by RCT, gradually winning over economics to our view of how things are. It remains true that we 
do not yet have, as Diane laments, a€oea benchmark framework appropriate to the digital
economy, anda€! suitable policy tools reflecting the frameworka€!a€D, but that behavioral framework 
for the attention economy will come. For example:


Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality

DRAFT: From AMe "Commodity Economy" to AMe "Attention Economy"?

The 2020-2022 COVID-19 plague caused by the coronavirus SARS-COVID-19 is, many today think, going 
to place the world economy in an odd position. For more than a quarter century now the ongoing 
revolution in data processing and data communications technology has been profoundly altering the 
basic underpinnings of property and exchange and valuea€”has been a€!

But I am markedly less optimistic about discourse about the economy outside of the academy. Again, 
John Maynard Keynes back in 1926:

From the time of John Stuart Mill, economists of authority have been in strong reactiona€!. [J.M.] 
Cairnes, in the introductory lecturea€! in 1870a€!. aCceThe maxim of laissez-fairea€\ has no 
scientific basis whatever, but is at best a mere handy rule of practice.a€Da€! This, for fifty 
years past [i.e., since 1876], has been the view of all leading economistsa€!.
Nevertheless, the guarded and undogmatic attitude of the best economists has not prevailed against 
the general opinion that an individualistic laissez-faire is both what they ought to teach and what 
in fact they do teacha€!

a€&Laissez-faire isa€! what [economists] ought to teach, and what in fact they do teach.a€D A great 
deal of money rides on the successful propagation of that doctrine, and those who stand to benefit 
from its propagation have a great deal of money and so a great deal of social power. Thus as an 
economist it is very hard for me to believe that the doctrine will not continue to propagate.

81.   On September 27, 2007, a senior officer of the Wall Street firm (the “senior
officer”) and a group of others comprised of trading, compliance and legal personnel called
Falcone  to discuss the situation with the MAAX zips and its possible resolution. The senior
officer’s principal goal was to find out if there were facts and circumstances that would justify a

price of par, or 100, for the zips (which Harbinger had offered in May). The senior officer did


not want the Wall Street firm in the situation of possibly aiding and abetting a market

manipulation.                                  * *

82.  During the conversation, Falcone insisted that the Wall Street firm buy in the
MAAX zips. Falcone stated that he would be willing to settle with the shorts now at 105.
Falcone attempted to justify this price by explaining MAAX’s debt structure and the
circumstances under winch the subordinated debt might be paid off before the senior and put
back     to the company at par or above.

83.  At some point, the conversation turned to the trading in the MAAX bonds. The
senior officer asked Falcone how the Wall Street firm might satisfy its obligation to Harbinger.
Falcone stated that the Wall Street firm should just keep bidding for the bonds. Falcone
acknowledged that the Wall Street firm would suffer some losses doing so, but told the senior
officer   and the others that sometimes you are just on the wrong side of a trade.

84.  In the course of this discussion, Falcone stated that he knew that the short position
in the MAAX zips had created a “long” position in excess of the issue size. When the senior
officer asked how he could possibly know this, Falcone stated that he was working the position
himself and that he (i.e., Harbinger) had acquired approximately 190 million bonds. The senior
officer and the other the Wall Street firm personnel were stunned.

Paragraphs:

Eric Topol: Omicron Is Getting More Defined'. a€~With Omicron, based on a limited number of UK 
cases, the 2-dose protection dropped down to 34, and boosted up to 75%. That is a big decline from 
Deltaa€! potentially associated with about a 5-fold higher breakthrough infection rate after a 
boostera€!. The rapid growth of Omicron is especially alarming, with a doubling rate between 2a€“3
days in multiple countriesa€!. We have the mitigation tools to defend against its transmission but 
have not been using them. California just re-instituted a state mask mandate which leverages that 
potential, a factor that had lapsed even as we are going through the second US Delta surgea€!. [Do] 
people with confirmed prior Covid need to get vaccinateda€!. For Omicron there is very little
neutralization antibody activity present in people who have had Covid infections from Alpha, Beta 
or Delta variantsa€!. In Denmark, the displacement of Omicron for Delta as dominanta€! is 
expecteda€! this weeka€!. Now let me get to the critical issuea€!. Where Omicron has been gaining 
steam, the proportion of hospitalizations is lower than expected, which is great. However, the main
reason     for thisa€! is nota€! the immunity wall that has been built in people throughout the 2 
years of the pandemica€!. Prior Covid or 2 shotsa€! do not provide much defense against Omicron. 
The 3rd shot helps, but the effectiveness is considerably lower than what we have seen with 
Deltaa€!. a€oelta€™ s the immunity, stupid,a€D is my simplest, reductionist way to convey the
