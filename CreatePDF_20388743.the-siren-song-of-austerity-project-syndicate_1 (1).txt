J. Bradford DeLong: The Siren Song of Austerity 
https://www.project-svndicate.org/commentary/return-of-austerity-in-us-bv-j-bradford-delong-2020-ll:
 a€~ Among the many
lessons of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath in the United States is that there is no 
good reason to start worrying about debt when unemployment remains high and interest
rates low. The hasty embrace of austerity derailed the last recovery, and it must not be allowed to 
do so again: BERKELEYa€“Ten years and ten months ago, US President Barack
Obama announced in his 2010 State of the Union address that it was time for austerity. a€oeFamilies 
across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions ,a€D
he explained. a€oeThe federal government should do the same.a€D Signaling his willingness to freeze 
government spending for three years, Obama argued that, a€oeLike any
cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we 
dona€™ t.a€D So great was the perceived need for austerity that he even
vowed     to a€oeenforce this discipline by veto ,a€D just in case congressional Democrats had 
something else in minda€!
