This is really, really bad. For one thing, for Facebook to say the report is inaccurate, but then 
not dare to say how the report is inaccuratea€”that is the ultimate non-denial denial. If you
can truthfully say anything elsea€”or even if you are confident that your lies will holda€”you will 
say something else, rather than take refuge in a denial that might apply only to the
smallest quibbling smidgen of the story.

There is no way to read this other than like this: There were powerful forces inside Facebook that 
saw selling more ads and getting richer as a cause subject to no moral or, indeed,
contractual (with Apple) limits whatsoever. And Mark Zuckerberg likes, approves of, and keeps such 
people around, permanently. So saw, and see. They are still there, and that is still
how Facebook is trying to conduct its business:

Rene Ritchie: Facebook & Spyware'. a€~NSO Groupa€™ s CEO, he said two Facebook representatives 
approached them back in October 2017 and asked to
purchase the right to use certain capabilities of ther military-grade Pegasus spyware on iPhone 
usera€!. Now, Facebook claimed NSOa€™ s account was
inaccurate and misrepresented the discussion, but offered no alternate account or rational for the 
that discussion, at least that Ia€™ ve ever seena€!

Where Are The Robotic Bricklayers?

When researching construction, you invariably discover that any new or innovative idea has actually 
been tried over and over again, often stretching back decades. One of these new-
but-actually-old ideas is the idea of a mechanical bricklayer, a machine to automate the 
construction of masonry wallsa€!

OlA°fA©mi O. TAjAwA2: Elite Capture & Epistemic Deference'. a€~Deference epistemology marks itself 
as a solution to an epistemic and political problem. But not only does it fail
to solve these problems, it adds new onesa€!. Elites from marginalized groups can benefit from this 
arrangement in ways that are compatible with social progress. But treating group
elitesa€™ interests as necessarily or even presumptively aligned with full group interests involves 
a political naivetA© we cannot afford. Such treatment of elite interests functions as a
racial Reaganomics: a strategy reliant on fantasies about the exchange rate between the attention 
economy and the material economya€!. After we in the chattering class get the clout
we deserve and secure the bag, [will] its contentsa€! trickle down to the workers who clean up 
after our conferences, to slums of the Global Southa€™ s megacities, to its
countryside[?]a€! Probably nota€!

Paul Krugman: a€~Noodling around on recent economic numbers. Ita€™ s really amazing how much recent 
inflation reflects just three things: used cars, hotel rooms, and airfares.
Combined, these three sectors account for less than 5% of the CPI but more than 1/2 of inflation 
over the past three months. Ita€™ s always true that some prices are rising more than
others. But this is really extreme, and does suggest transitory bottlenecks rather than broad-based 
inflation pressurea€!

Paul Krugman: What Covid Vaccine Supply Tells Us About International Trade'. a€~Vaccine ingredients

technological competence^!. So why wasna€™t eacha€! producing the whole ensemble?a€! Herea€™ sa€! 
Bown and Bollykya€!. a€oeThe business modela€! of the pharmaceutical
industrya€! involved fragmentation^!. That trade could play a greater role in distributing 
pharmaceutical products globally meant that companies could operate fewer plants but at a
larger scale.a€D [Emphasis mine." Hey, ita€™ s New Trade Theory in action! And it sure looks as if 
there was a lot of random historical contingency determining national rolesa€!. Is
there a moral?a€! Vaccine production illustrates a positive side of globalizationa€!. These miracle 
vaccines are incredibly complex productsa€!. A global market made it possible to
deliver all the specialized inputs that are saving thousands of lives as you read thisa€!

numbers of young people, including adolescents and kids being hospitalized and
even pediatric ICUs (PICUs) filling up. We need to take stock about whata€™ s happening here: PICUs 
being overwhelmed and schools havena€™t opened yet for in person classes. I
was very blunt. We have to stop screwing around, realize that we might soon face an unprecedented 
surge in childrena€™ s hospital COVID19 admissions. Also wea€™re seeing lots
of RSV even RSV-Covid co-infections. Wea€™re in crisis mode and must do the following now: 1) mask 
mandates for schools, 2) vaccine mandates for schools, 12 and up, and 3)

Jacob T. Levy: Whoa€™ s Afraid of Judith Shklar?: a€~Meet the American philosopher who showed that 
Western politics could only move forward by first taking a step backwarda€!.
a€reThe Liberalism of Feara€Ua€! is fundamentally an essay about the boundaries of liberalism. Over 
the course of the mid- to late 20th century, liberalism became encumbered by
considerable cultural baggagea€!. Shklar tries to recenter liberalism by insisting it is 
essentially a politicals! doctrinea€! freedom, but the substance of freedom is to be determined by
the individuals seeking it for themselvesa€!. She thought the philosophical and juridical 
liberalism of rights and justice associated with Immanuel Kant and Rawls, as well as the
aspirational liberalism of self-development found in John Stuart Milla€™ s work, ultimately went 
astray because it distracted from the most urgent political task associated with
freedom: restraining state violencea€!. Shklar treated peoplea€™ s experience of injustice as 
worthy of moral consideration on its owna€!.. Shklara€™ s was a liberalism motivated not
by   a summum bonum, an ultimate good, but by a summum malum, an ultimate evil, something to be 
avoided: namely, cruelty and the fear it inspires. Liberalising™ s emphasis on
restraint, she argued, should be motivated by the distinctive political evil of living in fear of 
state violence and crueltya€!

Ed Zitron: The Hybrid Office Is Anti-Workera€ ” & a Failure of Management'. a€~Companies such as 
Zillow and Salesforcea€! level the playing fielda€!. Instead of having in-office
employees gather in a conference room while remote employees dial in, if one person is not in the 
physical room, everyone will dial in separately on their laptop, regardless of whether
theya€™re in the office. And just like that, therea€™ s an immediate solution to a€oeleaving people 
outa€D of meetingsa€!. Hybrid worka€! is a stopgap between a reframing of what
an  office actually is, and an attempt to hold back the future of work, which will be primarily 
remote for those who can do their work at the computer. Ita€™ s a frenzied attempt by
executives and managers to keep some form of control other than a€ repaying and treating people 
well enough to keep them working for you,a€D with bizarre attempts to recreate after­
work drinks and social events that nobody at work really neededa€!. We are at a point where people 
are actively coming up with reasons not to go remote, and hybrid work is simply
their way of instituting a compromise, with the (potentially) intended consequence of alienating 
those who dona€™t come into the officea€!

victors of the hybrid debate. It includes every trope Ia€™ ve grown to love - the
