The remarkable thing is that as of 1917 Lenin seems to really have believed all this:

Vladimir Lenin (1917): The State & Revolution'. a€~We are not Utopians, we do not a€cedreama€D of 
dispensing at once with all administration^!. At oncea€! replacea€! state officials bya€! simplea€! 
functionsa€! within the ability of the average town dwellera€! performed for a€oeworkmena€™ s 
wagesa€Da€l. Iron discipline backed up by the state power of the armed workersa€!. Officialsa€! 
simply carrying
out our instructions as responsible, revocable, modestly paid a€oeforemen and accountantsa€Da€!. 
Control and accounting, becoming more and more simplea€! performed by each in turn, willa€! die out 
as the special functions of a special sectiona€!. We shall have a splendidly equipped 
mechanisma€!which can very well be set going by the united workers themselves, who will hire 
technicians, foremen and
accountants, and pay them all, as indeed all a€cestatea€D officials in general, workmena€™ s 
wagesa€!.

Disgusting bourgeois parliamentarism^! mere talking shopsa€! fooling the credulous rustics with 
phrase mongering and resolutionsa€!. Revolutionary democratic phrases to gull the rural Simple 
Simons, and bureaucracy and red tape to a€oegladden the heartsa€D of the capitalistsa€!. 
Substituted! for the venal and rotten parliamentarism of bourgeois society institutions in which 
freedom of opinion and discussion
does not degenerate into deception, for the parliamentarians themselves have to work, have to 
execute their own laws, have themselves to test the results achieved in reality, and to account 
directly to their constituents.a€! We cannot imagine democracy, even proletarian democracy, without 
representative institutions, but we can and must imagine democracy without parliamentarism^!.

We are not Utopians, and do not in the least denya€! excesses or the need to stop sucha€! as simply 
and as readily as any crowda€! put[s] a stop to a scuffle ora€! prevent[s] a woman from being 
assaulteda€!.

The higher phase of the development of communisma€! presupposes not the present ordinary run of 
people, who, like the seminary students in Pomyalovskya€™ s stories, are capable of damaging the 
stocks of public wealth a€oejust for funa€D, and of demanding the impossiblea€!.

Until the a€oehighera€D phasea€! the socialists demand the strictest control by society and by the 
state over the measure of labor and the measure of consumption^! exerciseda€! by a state of armed 
workersa€! the conversion of all citizens into workersa€! [for] one huge a€cesyndicatea€Da€l and 
the complete subordination ofa€! this syndicate to a genuinely democratic statea€!.

Engels here approached the interesting boundary line at which consistent democracya€! is 
transformed into socialism anda€! demands socialisma€!. It must be made impossible for 
a€cehonorablea€D though profitless posts in the Civil Service to be used as a springboard to highly 
lucrative posts in banks or joint stock companies, as constantly happens in all the freest 
capitalist countriesa€!. Democracy for the vast
majority of the people, and suppression by force, i.e., exclusion from democracy, of the exploiters 
and oppressors of the people this is the change democracy undergoes during the transition from 
capitalism to communism. Only in communist society, when the resistance of the capitalists have 
disappeared, when there are no classes.a€! Only then will a truly complete democracy become 
possible and be realizeda€!.
People will [then] gradually become accustomed to observing the elementary rules of social 
intercourse^ I without force, without coercion, without subordination, without the special 
apparatus for coercion called the state. The expression a€oethe state withers awaya€D is very well 
chosen, for it indicates both the gradual and the spontaneous nature of the processa€!. Communism 
alone is capable of providing really
complete democracy, and the more complete it is, the sooner it will become unnecessary and wither 
away of its own accorda€!.

During the transition from capitalism to communism suppression is still necessarya€!. A 
a€cestatea€D is still necessary, but this is now a transitional statea€! for the suppression of the 
minority of exploiters by the majority of the wage slaves of yesterday is comparatively so easy, 
simple and natural a task that it will entail far less bloodshed than the suppression of the 
risings of slaves, serfs or wage laborers, and it
will cost mankind far less. And it is compatible with the extension of democracy to such an 
overwhelming majority of the population^!. The people can suppress the exploiters even with a very 
simple a€oemachinea€Da€! by the simple organization of the armed people (such as the Soviets of 
Workersa€™ and Soldiersa€™ Deputies, we would remark, running ahead)a€!.

The great majority of the functions of the old a€oestate powera€Da€! can be reduced toa€! 
exceedingly simplea€! registration, filing, and checkinga€! can be easily performed by every 
literate persona€!for ordinary a€oeworkmena€™ s wagesa€D, anda€! stripped of every shadow of 
privilege, of every semblance of a€oeofficial grandeura€Da€!.

The economic basis for the complete withering away of the state is such a high state of development 
of communisma€!. Expropriation of the capitalistsa€! will make it possible for the productive 
forces to develop to a tremendous extenta€! transforming labor into a€oelifea€™ s prime wanta€Ua€!. 
The question of the time required fora€! the withering away [is] quite open, because there is no 
material for answering
these questions. The state will be able to wither awav comnletelv when societv adopts the rule: 
a€oeFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needsa€da€l.

Robert Service: Lenin: A Biography. a€™ So why has Lenin been charged with monumental insincerity 
in relation to the book [State and Revolution/? The main reason lies in the contrast between the 
predictions made in The State and Revolution_ and the reality of Bolshevism in power. The State and 
Revolution described an imminent future when the working class would become the ruling class and 
ordinary workers themselves take the
crucial decisions of state and society. Things turned out very differently after October 1917, when 
the Soviet state quickly became a one-party dictatorship that used force against industrial strikes 
and political protests by workers. A long shadow of doubt was cast over his intentions when he 
wrote The State and Revolution^.}

Nadezhda Krupskaya: .Reminiscences of Lenin: Zurich 1916'. a€~There were differences with Rosa 
Luxemburg, Radek, the Dutch, Bukharin, Pyatakov, and to some extent with Kollontai. The sharpest 
differences were with Pyatakova€!. Ilyich sat down at once to write him a replya€!. The role of 
democracy in the struggle for socialism could not be ignored. a€oeSocialism is impossible without 
democracy in two respects,a€D Vladimir
Ilyich wrotea€! a€oel. The proletariat cannot carry out a socialist revolution unless it has 
prepared for it by a struggle for democracy; 2. Victorious socialism cannot maintain its victory 
and bring humanity to the time when the state will wither away, unless democracy is fully 
achieved.a€na€! As far back as October 1915 Ilyich had written a reply to an article by Radek 
(Parabellum)a€!. "The proletariat can win only through democracy, i.e.,
through putting into effect full democracy and linking up every step of its progress with 
democratic demands in their most emphatic wording. It is absurd to offset the socialist revolution 
and the revolutionary struggle against capitalism by one of the questions of democracya€!. We must 
combine the revolutionary struggle against capitalism with a revolutionary programme and tactics in 
respect of all democratic demands, including a republic,
a militia, election of government officials by the people, equal rights for women, 
self-determination of nations, etc. So long as capitalism exists all these demands are capable of 
realization only as an exception, and in incomplete, distorted forma€!. We demand the overthrow of 
capitalism and expropriation of the bourgeoisie as an essential basis both for abolishing the 
poverty of the masses and for fully and thoroughly implementing all
democratic transformations. Somea€! will be started before the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, others 
in the coursea€! and still others after it. The social revolution isa€! an epoch ofa€! of battles 
on all and every problem of economic and democratic transformations^!. It is quite conceivable that 
the workers of a given country may overthrow the bourgeoisie before any single cardinal democratic 
transformation has been fully implemented.

But it is quite inconceivable that the proletariat, as an historical class, will be able to defeat 
the bourgeoisie unless it has been prepared for it by being educated in a spirit of the most 
consistent and determined revolutionary democratism^!
