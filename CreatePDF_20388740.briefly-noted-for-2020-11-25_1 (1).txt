Jeremiah: 22 KJV https://biblehub.com/kjv/jeremiah/22.htm: a€~Thus saith the LORD: "Execute ye 
judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the
oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither 
shed innocent blood in this place. For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there
enter   in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots 
and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. But if ye will not hear these words, I
swear by myself", saith the LORD, "that this house shall become a desolation." For thus saith the 
LORD unto the king's house of Judah: "Thou art Gilead unto me, and the head of
Lebanon: yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited. And I will 
prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut
down   thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire. And many nations shall pass by this city, 
and they shall say every man to his neighbour, 'Wherefore hath the LORD done thus
unto this great city?' Then they shall answer, 'Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD 
their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them'"a€!

Duncan Black: Failed 4th Estate https ://www.eschatonblog .com/2020/11/failed-4th-estate .html: 
a€~I think the very Trump-specific sin of the media (as opposed to their normal
sinning) was confusing an understandable decision to "treat this lunatic freakazoid as we would 
normally treat a president" with "go out of our way to portray this lunatic freakazoid
as normal." I get it. It was difficult to do the first part without doing the second part. If the 
scandal-o-meter goes up to 7 on a tan suit, then anything resembling normal practices
can't cope when Trump makes it hit 11 by 7am most days. And, who knows, maybe they didn't even do 
him any favors. Maybe The People love their lunatic freakazoid president.
But the first draft of history has hardly been an accurate oneaC!

On 2017-12-17, Michael Boskin claimed the TMR tax cut would generate a big boom in equipment 
investment. Perhaps a full percentage point or so. None of the model-builders
agreed with him. And he was wrong: there was none such in 2018 or 2019; spending did not wheel from 
consumption to investment; aCceunlockedaCD foreign earnings were paid
out in dividends, not invested in equipment. He has never explained or analyzed why he was wrong. 
Or why he was confident in the first place: Michael Boskin (29017): Another

macs: a€~The Ml. The new Ml-based MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook

Pro, and Mac Mini are... three different manifestations of the same computer... far faster machines 
than the Intel-based Macs theyaC™ re replacing. But the big win, and clear focus
from Apple, isnaC™ t speed but battery life.... This is the sellable bullet point for the mass 
market consumer. The Ml really is an entire system on a chip. Everything is on the Ml.

The various processors, of course: the CPU cores, the GPU cores, the Neural Engine cores. But 
everything else is on the Ml too: the storage controller, the Secure Enclave, the
memory controller, and, yes, the memory itself. The DRAM for Ml-based Macs is on the package 
(aCoeon the substrateaCD, I believe, is the technical lingo). ThereaC™ s no

separate aCoevideo memoryaCD and aCoesystem memorya€na€”just memory. AppleaC™ s chip team is really 
proud of this UMA system and the integrated GPU on the Ml.

ItaC™ s a design that increases performance and power efficiency. For over a decade, iPhones and 
iPads have had Apple-designed chips the competition could not and still cannot

match. Now the Mac does tooaC!

Sara Gibbs: Everything I Never Wanted to Have to Know About Labour & Antisemitismm 
https://medium,com/@sararoseofficial/everything-i-never-wanted-to-have-to-know-
about-labour-and-antisemitism-649b5bcle576: a€~I want the last four years of my life back.  If 
youa€™re new to this and listening, thank you. I know a lot of my fellow activists

will be annoyed that Ia€™ m taking this tone but at this point I am so exhausted from four years of 
begging people to listen on this subject that I am grateful for any new allies and
support. If you are listening, youa€™re already doing more than most. One of the most devastating 
aspects of LabouraC™ s antisemitism crisis has been seeing the sheer volume of

personal devastation^I

A huge amounta€”an absolutely huge amounta€”was lost when Harry Dexter White overrode John Maynard 
Keynes at Bretton Woods and placed responsibility for closing
"fundamental disequilibria" on deficit countries alone. This policy mistake still haunts us. And 
odds are that it is about to haunt us again. Jeremy Bulow and Company sound the
alarm: Jeremy Bulow & al.: The Debt Pandemic

 a€~The COVID-19
pandemic has greatly lengthened the list of developing and emerging market economies in debt 
distress. For some, a crisis is imminent. For many more, only exceptionally low
global interest rates may be delaying a reckoning. Yet new challenges may hamper debt workouts 
unless governments and multilateral lenders provide better tools to navigate a

wave of restructuringaC!

a€~First, then, governments and markets are co-constituted. Government regulation is not an 
intrusion into the market but rather a prerequisite for a functioning market economy....
Second, real-world political economy hinges on power, both political and market power. Specific 
forms of market governancea€”of the kinds we just sketcheda€”do not arise
naturally                                                                               or 
innocently. They are the product of power struggles between firms, industries, workers, and 
governments within particular markets and in the political arena.  Third,

there is more than one way to organize society to achieve economic growth, equity, and access to 
valued goods and services. The balance of power between government, workers,
and firms differs greatly across countries and timea€!

Alan S. Blinder & Mark W. Watson (2016): Presidents & the US Economy: An Econometric Exploration 
https://pubs .aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.2O 140913: a€~The US
economy has performed better when the president of the United States is a Democrat rather than a 
Republican, almost regard- less of how one measures performance. For many
measures, includ- ing real GDP growth (our focus), the performance gap is large and significant. 
This paper asks why. The answer is not found in technical time series matters nor in
systematically more expansionary mone- tary or fiscal policy under Democrats. Rather, it appears 
that the Democratic edge stems mainly from more benign oil shocks, supe- rior
total factor productivity (TFP) performance, a more favorable international environment, and 
perhaps more optimistic consumer expectations about the near-term futurea€!

https://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-

literature on a€ceeffective protectiona€D. Tariffs on imported inputs

provided negative effective protection to downstream activities. And thata€™ s what seems to have 
happened with the Trump trade war. Tariffs were largely focused on


intermediate rather than final goods. The net effect, then, may actually have been to discourage

unemployment payments... expire today. The main reason for extending them is because there are 
millions of Americans who are out of work and they desperately need the

money.... [Plus] if the payments are cut off it will devastate an already ravaged economy.... So 
why are Republicans hemming and hawing?. From a purely selfish perspective,

Republicans ought to be in favor of doing anything they can to keep the economy in decent shape 
through the election.... The whole thing is a disgrace. Why are Republicans

acting so contemptibly?a€!

most energetic supporters on Wall Street, sought to assuage such
fears,         saying the president was within his rights to challenge election results and 
forecasting that the legal process would take its course. He asked whether other participants did 
not
find it surprising that early votes in Pennsylvania had favoured Mr Trump, only for later counts to 
tip the state in Mr Bidena€™ s favour. Mr Schwarzman said there had been news
reports stating that ballots continued arriving days after the election and that some of them may 
not have been reala€’’issues, he said, that needed to be resolved by the courts, as the
