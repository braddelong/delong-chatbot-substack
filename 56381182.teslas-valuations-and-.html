I found myself looking at Tesla’s stock price: after all, “crypto” today appears highly correlated in its stock market valuation with “tech”, and Tesla is now looking like a tech-factor stock rather than a manufacturing-factor stock. That is, Tesla is trading as if it is constructing a walled garden within which it will then leverage a piece of software written once that runs everywhere and harvests the activity of its users for some chain of actions vague in the middle that ends with “PROFITS LARGE FOREVER!”. It is not trading like a company whose profits depend on large-scale efficient execution of manufacturing processes—a company that makes large things out of metal using technologies for which the knowledge is widely distributed.</p><p>And I ran across a tweet thread by the highly estimable Brianna Wu:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Brianna Wu</strong>: <em>’What gets me about Tesla fanatics.</em> It’s not just the death threats and personal attacks for asking eminently reasonable questions about a stock valued more than every other car company combined. It’s the men who assume questioning it means you’re too stupid to understand. </p><p>Well, I do question why a company with a P/E of 90 is worth so much more that Ford, which has a P/E of less than 4 AND sells more than 4x as many cars, AND has a killer electric truck in market. I DO question why Tesla is worth so much when it currently has 85 percent of the EV market and can barely squeeze a profit without resorting to bitcoin speculation, which by the way has plummeted in value. </p><p>I DO question how many people are going to continue to have faith in a founder that announces some wild new idea every four seconds, and can’t seem to bring any of it to market. Battery swaps, solar charger SuperChargers, Cars moonlighting as autonomous Taxis. </p><p>All these questions are reasonable. Sexist horseshit assuming I don’t know what I’m talking about is not. You can send armies of anonymous accounts to scream at me till the cows come home. I don’t care. But you can’t delay the market from asking these questions forever…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/BriannaWu">https://twitter.com/BriannaWu</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Consider: At its current stock price of $675/share, and with more than a billion shares outstanding, Tesla is “worth” $675,000 for each of the million cars it manufactured in the past year—it is selling, even now, at not just 90 times earnings, but 11 times trailing annual revenue. Think that, as equities, Tesla shares to have a long-run permanent earnings yield of 5%/year in order to support stock valuations. Thus the company’s realistic projected permanent earnings have to be $35 billion/year. Selling all the cars sold in America, and selling each for a profit of $20,000 per car, and getting there very quickly (for money in fifteen years is worth half of money today at standard equity discount rates)—that is what the marginal Tesla shareholder right now is “thinking” about Tesla and its prospects. (If you think it is going to take ten years for Tesla to reach market dominance, you need $30,000 profit per car.)</p><p>Or they could do it with a quarter of the American car market, with profits of $80,000 per car. </p><p>Or they could do it with a quarter of the American car market, with profits of $160,000 per car if it took them 15 years to get there. </p><p>It could happen. But do note that these numbers have your profits calculated after taxes and debt interest: this is not EBIT, let alone EBITDA.</p><p>Or some one of Tesla’s other future businesses could catch fire, at 1/4 of the iPhone scale of profitability—but what incentive does Elon have not to tunnel the valuable intellectual property out of Tesla and into another one of his vehicles as that happens?</p><p>Complicating matters is that Elon Musk is not a prudent fiduciary seeking to maximize the fundamental value of the payouts to shareholders from companies he is involved in. <em><strong>Elon wants to have fun and change the world</strong></em>: payment systems, electric cars, batteries, subways, travel to Mars, satellites! High stock market valuations are useful tools for that: they gave Elon social power in the form of wealth, and he then leverages that into social power in the form of celebrity influence. But if you inownstock in an Elon company, <em><strong>he does not work for you</strong></em>. You are, if anything, his prey—or, at best, a spear-carrier in the background on the stage, not even part of the chorus.</p><p>Tesla is… unlikely to be near its fundamental value today. Five years ago it was valued at 1/10 as much—that would be, if it obtained maturity fifteen years (now ten years out, in 2032), a quarter of the American car market with a profit of $8,000 per car: the equivalent of the old Ford Motor Company in its glory days, in a boom year.</p><p>Let me hasten to add that just because it is unlikely that Tesla shares are valued near their fundamental values, when Tesla is assessed as a profit-making enterprise, does not say much about the true value of Tesla. </p><p>In particular, it does not mean that Tesla is in any sense unworthy as a productive enterprise—on the contrary: it is an extraordinarily valuable enterprise, considered from the appropriate point of view.</p><p>But shareholders are unlikely to receive a great deal of that value. </p><p>We all have learned enormous amounts from Tesla’s attempts to profitably make electric cars at scale. In particular, all of Tesla’s present and future competitors have learned. The world in the future would be a poorer place if Tesla had not taken the plunge. </p><p>But the ultimate valuable product of Tesla is not likely to be cars sold in the future for more than the cost of materials and labor. </p><p>The ultimate valuable product of Tesla is likely to be the public good of all the engineering and social-organizational learning that Tesla-as-an-experiment is generating right now.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/teslas-valuations-and-?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/teslas-valuations-and-?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Asianometry</strong>: <em>(759) MEMS: The Second Silicon Revolution?</em>: ‘MEMS or Microelectromechanical Systems are microsystems with both electric and mechanical functions….

In the past Replacement Theory had 3/8 of the political nation on its side—half of the Republican Party and half of the southern wing of the Democratic Party—and was only able to pass legislation during the temporary 1920s purge of Progressives. Today Replacement Theory has all of the Republican Party in its corner:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Timothy Burke</strong>: <em>The News: A Yet-Unbroken Chain</em>: ‘The public culture that thinks of itself as mainstream sensible American values and viewpoints has had to reckon with just how much of the country thinks otherwise and has thought otherwise for quite some time…. You can still see the archaeological fragments of this complacency in how pundits and politicians scramble to label the concept of “replacement theory”… as an insane, extreme, marginal idea that was only available to the shooter due to the ungoverned and irresponsible character of online media…. This at least is historically wrong…. It’s a rebranding of the kind of nativism that coalesced first around hostility to Irish immigration in the 1840s and then shaped electoral politics and policies aiming to restrict residential and political rights of people already in the United States as well as new immigration throughout the 19th Century and into the 20th, up to the Immigration Act of 1924…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:55470234,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://timothyburke.substack.com/p/the-news-a-yet-unbroken-chain&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:381094,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Eight by Seven&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b2503fa7-8c41-4da3-93ec-44dbee8f498a_256x256.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The News: A Yet-Unbroken Chain&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;For thirty years, Americans have been wrestling with a still-unresolved question about the Internet.

Perhaps there will be thriving "web3” businesses in the future. But what incentive will those starting such future businesses ever have to give a substantial share of what they are doing to current first-generation crypto assets, rather than starting from fresh with third- or fourth- or nth-generation crypto assets which they can newly mint themselves?:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Thomas Stackpole</strong>: <em>Cautionary Tales from Cryptoland</em>: ‘Web3 is off to a rocky start… fraud, hacks, and collapses…. Web3 critic Molly White…. "Late 2021… An enormous number of crypto and Web3 projects going terribly…. Privacy is theoretically provided through pseudonymity…. But… keeping one’s wallet address private can be… a lot of work and is likely to only become more challenging if this future vision of crypto ubiquity is realized…. The ideological argument for Web3 is very compelling, and I personally hold many of the same ideals…. I just don’t think that creating technologies based around cryptocurrencies and blockchains is the solution…. We are… beyond… “ignore it and hope it goes away”….

Note that this is much more than a mere claim that quantum mechanics underpins biology. It is a claim that quantum-computing information transmission effects guide the flow of energy through a plant. But how possible? And how useful? My uninformed guess is that we would need a mature technology of near-room-temperature superconductors before we could start taming unwanted decoherence enough for quantum computing to be a large-scale part of the economy:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Bryan Walsh</strong>: ’I have watched the quantum computing space long enough to know that the work… stands to drive the next great leap in computing… major implications for progress in everything from cybersecurity to artificial intelligence to designing better batteries. Provided, of course, they can actually make these things work…. A quantum computer’s power increases exponentially with the addition of each new reliable qubit… “entanglement”…. Simulate the properties of a theoretical battery… untangle complex logistical problems, discover optimal delivery routes… break cryptography methods…. The race for quantum supremacy is also… international…. But none of that will be possible unless researchers can do the hard engineering work…. Superposition and entanglement?…. The slightest variation in temperature or noise or radiation can cause them to lose…. IBM… a 4,000-plus qubit computer by 2025… could move beyond the experimentation phase, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told reporters…. Plenty of experts are skeptical that IBM or any of its competitors will ever get there…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.vox.com/23132776/quantum-computers-ibm-google-cybersecurity-artificial-intelligence-white-house">https://www.vox.com/23132776/quantum-computers-ibm-google-cybersecurity-artificial-intelligence-white-house</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>The problem is that Boris Johnson’s business model is and always has been half lying, and half promise-breaking. And somehow I don’t think the European Union will listen to Martin Wolf’s plea to be merciful and kind to a Britain that is outside the tent pissing in. It is true that it would be much worse had Boris Johnson not “got Brexit done”. In the counterfactual he is inside the tent pissing in.</p><p>There is logic and reason behind Wolf’s claim that the European Union is better off, because Brexit is “helping it to make far faster progress than it would have done if the UK had remained a member.” But I don’t think that triggers the kind of gratitude that anyone will ever be able to take to the bank:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Martin Wolf</strong>: <em>Johnson Must Embrace the Brexit He Made</em>: ‘Once again [Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson] is planning… to repudiate parts of the UK’s Brexit deal… on which he campaigned. This would destroy the UK’s reputation for keeping its word, invite a parallel EU repudiation of its free trade deal with the UK, enrage the Biden administration and divide the west…. After the referendum, the Brexiters insisted that their narrow victory mandated them to choose the hardest possible Brexit, whatever its cost. They rejected the single market. They also repudiated Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement…. Once in power, Johnson made his deal to “get Brexit done”, the one he now wishes to change unilaterally. Then he said that “Northern Ireland has a great deal. You keep free movement and access to the single market but you also have unfettered access to GB.”… In a recent speech justifying unilateral repudiation, Lord Frost, Johnson’s negotiator, argued that “The detail of the protocol’s provisions was essentially imposed under duress because we had no ‘walk away’ option.” As a matter of fact, we did. But it would have been too costly to exercise…. The EU should also engage, recognising that Brexit has been helping it to make far faster progress than it would have done if the UK had remained a member. Gratitude for removal of this obstacle should encourage it to be conciliatory…. The UK has to keep its promises. This depressing version of Groundhog Day must now end…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1390c053-2740-40c6-9e4e-525f7c4cad71">https://www.ft.com/content/1390c053-2740-40c6-9e4e-525f7c4cad71</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>
