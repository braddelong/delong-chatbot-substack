A typical century would see technology advance by little. Perhaps the population at the end of the century could have lived 5% better than those at the start—if the population had stayed the same. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://bit.ly/3pP3Krk&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Preorder \&quot;Slouching Towards Utopia\&quot;&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://bit.ly/3pP3Krk"><span>Preorder "Slouching Towards Utopia"</span></a></p><p>In this environment, Malthusian forces were dominant. The only way for women to have durable social power was to be the mothers of surviving sons, and even with high fertility more than a quarter saw all their sons die, so better nutrition would lead them to try harder. Thus the population grew by 10% in an average century, and so smaller farm sizes offset better technology and kept the real income of the typical human much the same. </p><p>And so human psychology, human sociology, and human polities stayed much the same, with substantial changes visible only if one took the long-duration viewpoint of millennia.</p><p>This frozen glacial creep of economic history came to an end in 1870. The ice had been cracking beforehand, over 1500 to 1870. But after 1870 saw the roaring of the cataract. In every single generation after 1870 technological change was so fast and the seizing of opportunities by the market economy so rapid that the economy revolutionized itself in a generation, and then did so again, every single generation. This was the story at least until 2010. (After which, a new story <em><strong>may</strong></em> have begun.)</p><p>The repeated, sequential, Schumpeterian creative-destruction economic revolutions meant that all was solid melted into air—all established patterns and orders were steamed away—and while men (and women) were not compelled to face with sober senses their real conditions of life and relations with one another, they did have to try to build new institutions to manage the problems and opportunities of production, distribution, and utilization that the onrushing technological cornucopia brought.</p><p>Friedrich von Hayek said that the market economy could produce unequal prosperity, but nothing more: trying to shape and manage it to produce social justice as well would fail, destroy prosperity, and put us on the road to, well, serfdom; and so the watchword had to be <strong>“the market giveth, the market taketh away, blessed be the name of the market”.</strong></p><p>John Maynard Keynes whimpered that—if only governments allowed his technocratic students to conduct a sensible monetary policy along with a "somewhat comprehensive" socialization of investment—it was within our grasp for everyone to have a job, and technology plus compound interest would wreak marvels and rock-bottom interest rates would “euthanize” the rentiers—so that they could use their money social power only at the cost of spending down their capital, and so relinquishing it. Thus in the not-very-long-run, Keynesian technocrats could solve the problems of production and distribution, leaving humanity to grapple with its real problem: that of utilization of our wealth to create a truly human world.</p><p>Karl Polanyi said that the "stark utopia" of von Hayek's market was unsustainable: the only rights it recognized were property rights and your own source of social power was your wealth, but people thought that they had other, more important, rights that society needed to vindicate—to economic security, to an income level proportional to what they deserved, that other people should have income levels proportional to what <em><strong>they deserved</strong></em> too, in a connected society that gave them respect and place. Plus that you should have some&nbsp;power in society even if you had no wealth. The watchword had to be: <em><strong>“the market was made for man, not man for the market”</strong></em>.</p><p>Political economists who did not recognize this and tried to bring the stark utopia of market society would thus face explosions, and be overwhelmed by social-political movements that sought social justice—which might be a very inegalitarian kind of social justice, because it would give people not equal shares but rather what those making the rules <em><strong>deserved</strong></em>.</p><p>The closest the whole thing came to holding together was the post-WWII era of social democracy, in which Keynesian focus on full employment (and low interest rates to make amortizing the WWII-era debt easy), Beveridgian equality-through-redistribution (and public provision), plus a little Pigovian externality-compensation produced the Thirty Glorious Years. But somehow social democracy failed its sustainability test, and was replaced by neoliberalism, which stubbornly persists in spite of its failure to fulfill any of its promises except that it would make the rich much richer with much more social power.</p><p>Now I am well aware that you will find that <em><strong>inadequate</strong></em> as a Grand Narrative.</p><p>But it is the one that I have.</p><p><em>Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Long 20th Century, 1870-2010</em>, forthcoming September 6 &lt;<a href="https://bit.ly/3pP3Krk">https://bit.ly/3pP3Krk</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/yet-another-attempt-at-a-better-slouching?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/yet-another-attempt-at-a-better-slouching?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Omar Moav</strong>: <em>How Farming Shaped the World</em> &lt;<a href="https:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVCsbDHdus">https:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVCsbDHdus</a>&gt;: </p><div id="youtube2-3DVCsbDHdus" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;3DVCsbDHdus&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3DVCsbDHdus?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay;

And <em><strong>Aufträgstaktik</strong></em> only worked not when individual subcommanders carried out the mission in the way they thought best, but when individual subcommanders carried out the mission <em><strong>in the way that made sense given training that had strongly inculcated in them the traditions of that army</strong></em>—in the Prussian army, move quickly, find what you think is a flank, and attack it immediately and mercilessly; in the British army, take cover and wait for the moment you can stand up and exert maximum firepower; in the Russian army, bring up your artillery and pound and pound and pound.</p><p>But a very nice piece. Now I have to decide whether this evening I am going to do my day job, or reread <strong>Robert Citino</strong>: <em>The German Way of War</em>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Adam Tooze</strong>: <em>Mission Command</em>: ‘Amongst NATO forces the first to adopt the term “mission command” or “mission tactics” were American marines and then the American Army in the 1980s editions of the basic field manual, FM 100–5. As was acknowledged at the time, the phrase is not originally English. “Mission command” is a loose translation of the German concept of Auftragstaktik. Its introduction to US and NATO doctrine was the fruit of the intensified interaction in the 1970s and 1980s between the US Army and the Bundeswehr in West Germany…. <em><strong>Aufträgstaktik</strong></em> was not invented by Hitler’s Wehrmacht…. Helmuth Moltke and his emphasis on the need to adjust war planning to particular circumstances and contingencies. A specifically tactical meaning of the term began to take shape in the later stages of WWI in the “Sturm” tactics…. Figures like Ernst Jünger or Erwin Rommel exemplified the new model of highly motivated, intelligent and independent battlefield leadership…. This convergence between US Army and Bundeswehr thinking was encouraged by Chief of Staff General Abrams, and was eagerly taken up by TRADOC commander and World War II veteran General William DePuy…. He was followed by General Don Starry commander of V Corps in West Germany and later head of TRADOC…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:56601225,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-128-mission-command-natos&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:192845,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Chartbook&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a8e73950-03bb-4589-afaf-d9cdd55ab61b_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Chartbook #128: Mission command - NATO's Strangelove vision of freedom enacted on the Ukraine battlefield &quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Russian forces attempted to cross the Siverskyi Donets river in eastern Ukraine this month using a pontoon bridge, but their tanks and armoured vehicles were picked off by Ukrainian artillery.

Go to Kansas City, and see the Steamboat Arabia Museum, and marvel at the huge amounts of stuff manufactured elsewhere that needed to be brought from the factories of the east around Florida and up the Mississippi-Missouri in order to support the farm-settler fringe:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Paul Krugman</strong>: <em>Elon Musk, Mars &amp; the Modern Economy</em>: ‘One million [for a Mars colony] is actually an absurdly low number of people—far too few to support a modern economy…. Charlie Stross…. “Colonizing Mars might well be practical, but only if we can start out by plonking a hundred million people down there.” I agree….

The focus on the market as the mechanism of international cooperation (rather than the state and its external diplomacy) has proven damaging to the developing world, especially in regions of weak or “failed” states…. The position of the large developing-world democracies—India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey, to name a few—have all declined in salient respects as economic globalization has put their nascent middle classes into competition with the rising Chinese middle class….

There are no “many worlds”. There is only one quantum wave-function world, in which everything happens—everything has a (complex number) amplitude—but we have conceptual access to only a trivial fraction of the wave function that is the universe, just as a radio has at any one minute access to only a trivial fraction of the messages being sent out vis electromagnetic waves:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Chad Orzel</strong>: <em>Many Worlds, but too Much Metaphor</em>: ‘The “Austere Quantum Mechanics” approach…. A collection of quantum things… described by a wavefunction… evolve according to the Schrödinger equation… end up in complicated superpositions of multiple states, superpositions that are entangled with each other… Being lazy humans, we often want to write down descriptions of things, and so we use a bookkeeping trick: we choose to pull out pieces of that one giant wavefunction and treat them as if they exist in isolation…. We bracket everything else off as “the environment” which is a black box in the same way that “Seventh National Bank” is in finance…. When we select out a tiny piece of it as our system of interest, we often see that system only in single states, not a superposition…. If the interaction with the environment is strong and poorly controlled, though, the conditions of your measurement change enough from one repetition to the next that you’re not really doing the same measurement multiple times…. You won’t see a clear dependence on the different evolution of the different states in the superposition, because it’s swamped by the unknown effect of the environment. If you can’t see the interference effect, that system “looks classical,” and you can treat it as having a definite state. That process of interaction with the changing state of an unknown environment gets the name “decoherence,” and it’s what enables the bookkeeping trick that lets us split off pieces of the wavefunction and consider them in isolation. If the piece you’re interested in is big enough and interacts with the environment strongly enough, there’s no hope of doing the interference measurement that would show it’s in a superposition state…. This is just bookkeeping, not a real separation…. Thinking about MWI in this way–as a bookkeeping trick to simplify an otherwise incomprehensibly vast wavefunction–clears up most of the typical objections that arise from taking the “separate worlds” metaphor too literally…. So, that’s my argument for why the way we talk about the Everettian interpretation of quantum mechanics sucks, and should be revisited…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2019/09/17/many-worlds-but-too-much-metaphor/?sh=7e428b4e625d">https://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2019/09/17/many-worlds-but-too-much-metaphor/?sh=7e428b4e625d</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>This, by constrast, I do not understand. </p><p>Had NATO and the EU washed their hands of Ukraine, Putin would now be launching his troops into Moldava, the Baltics, and (perhaps) Poland and Finland. </p><p>Yes. we should be willing to contribute huge amounts of resources to try to create a bargaining range so that Ukraine and Muscovy can end the war—carrots.

I think the evidence is clear that we did not think he was an aggressor before February 22, 2014. This is a story that we invented so that we could blame him. My argument is that the West, especially the United States, is principally responsible for this disaster…. He understands that he cannot conquer Ukraine and integrate it into a greater Russia or into a reincarnation of the former Soviet Union. He can’t do that…. He’s going to take some territory away from Ukraine, in addition to what happened with Crimea, in 2014. Furthermore, he is definitely interested in regime change. Beyond that, it’s hard to say exactly what this will all lead to, except for the fact that he is not going to conquer all of Ukraine…. We invented this story that Putin is highly aggressive and he’s principally responsible for this crisis in Ukraine…. He’s not going to turn to the Baltic states. First of all, the Baltic states are members of NATO and—</strong> Is that a good thing? <strong>No.</strong> You’re saying that he’s not going to invade them in part because they’re part of NATO, but they shouldn’t be part of NATO. <strong>Yes, but those are two very different issues. I’m not sure why you’re connecting them. Whether I think they should be part of NATO is independent of whether they are part of NATO…. We should be pivoting out of Europe to deal with China in a laser-like fashion, number one. And, number two, we should be working overtime to create friendly relations with the Russians.

reign of the Chinese Communist Party. My big problem, I think, is that I do not understand network-and-connections politics. I understand, I think, feudal politics—patrons and clients, and the exchange of resources for support. I understand, I think, electoral politics—factions and votes, and then the losers submit to the winners and become the “loyal opposition” because there will be another election in which they can try to persuade the (s)electorate, especially because there is broad agreement that what divides us is less than what unites us.</p><p>But network-and-connections politics? There is, on the surface, a fiction that the Party is united in agreement and obedience to the “correct line” of analysis and—a “Rousseauist” fiction that there is a general will that has been ascertained and that all are happy with. And there is a fiction that this general will is incarnate in the paramount leader, whom all hasten to obey. But the paramount leader fears that if he moves too fast or in the wrong direction, he will wind up Khrushcheved. There is some sort of balancing-of-factions. And, among the factions, there is some kind of struggle for position-and-power. What divergences of opinion on policy there are “among the people” can very easily and suddenly change as formerly high cadres now become wreckers—“the #1 and #2 persons in authority taking the capitalist road”. Plus, often, “the mountains are high, and the emperor is far”.</p><p>How legitimate authority is gained and held in such a “Rousseauist” bureaucratic system overlaid with patron-client, common-patron, and peer-solidarity bonds is beyond me. What role is played by the 8341 regiment of the People’s Liberation Army is not clear. How the rest of the PLA weighs in, and how much decisions of personnel and policy are shaped by a need or a desire to please the Old Hundred Names is also something I do not understand.</p><p>But Victor Shih has written a very good book!</p><div><hr></div><p>It is: <strong>Victor Shih</strong> (2022):<em> Coalitions of the Weak: Élite Politics in China from Mao’s Strategem to the Rise of Xi</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: 978-1316516959) &lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1316516954">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1316516954</a>&gt;.</p><p>Up above is a spreadsheet of the members of the Political Bureau—the Politburo—of the Chinese Communist Party from 1956-2017, and of its all-important Standing Committee, where members are ranked in order of importance. (Note that Zhou Enlai is never number two, having noted, as his sometime friend CIA analyst Walter Southard, my friend Jon Southard’s father, put it, that the number twos kept getting killed off.) I have added some color coding. Grey are “scribblers”—people who can do work, persuade with arguments, and follow a line laid down by their patron, but who do not have a dense social network of friends or allies, hence nobody who counts would mind if someday they simply disappeared. Pink are “princelings”—children of high cadres who thus have available to them not only their own social network of connections who care about their well-being and promotion, but can draw on their fathers’ networks as well.</p><p>And yellow are soldiers who belonged to the Fourth Front Army during the Long March and post-Long March era. Here is Victor Shih’s most major new insight—certainly I had never heard it before. These soldiers were semi-purged as counterrevolutionaries, demoted in rank, and assigned to the 129th Division where the political commissar was Deng Xiaoping. Their purging made them friendless and networkless (outside of their own circles of 4FA veterans). Deng Xiaoping’s prevention of any further purging and working over the years to rehabilitate them meant that they all became incredibly loyal to him.</p><p>What is the story behind this spreadsheet? In 1965 Mao Zedong had a problem. Chen Yun ran finance. Zhou Enlai ran foreign policy. Zhu De and Lin Biao ran the army. Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping ran the party, and made sure that while Mao was respected and honored, he was not greatly listened to when his ideas differed from those of the people on the ground. The disasters of the Great Leap Forward and the Great Famine that had followed kept most people in authority from wanting Mao’s hands actually on the tiller. Mao wanted to be boss, not a senile and flattered elder.</p><p>Mao still had his Cult of Personality: his ability to mobilize hundreds of thousands to "bombard the headquarters", and also to take 3/4 of some layers of the bureaucracy in ministries and send them out to the countryside to learn from the workers and peasants, with very few taking the road of Xu Shiyou of heading off to Mount Tianzhu and preparing to defend themselves with force, if necessary. So Mao could and did launch the Cultural Revolution. On the ideological level, he called for the demolition of the CCP of bureaucratic careerists and its replacement by a CCP of “Reds”. On the political level, he brought in Chen Boda, secret policeman Kang Sheng, Long-March veteran (and thus Mao supporter) Li Fuchun, and Long-March veteran and Red-Guard leader Tao Zhu into an expanded Politburo Standing Committee, and added two more 4FA veterans to the overall Politburo. </p><p>Mao then, strengthened, attacked and purged Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping (and demoted the newly-promoted Li Fuchun and Tao Zhu when they resisted the “bombard the headquarters” policy), and once again took his place at the head of the government, such as it was. As of 1969 the Politburo Standing Committee consisted of loyal secret policeman Kang Sheng, scribbler Chen Boda, Zhou Enlai, and as number #2 Mao’s designated successor and closest comrade-in-arms, Marshall Lin Biao. And a further three 4FA veterans were brought into the expanded Politburo.</p><p>Mao is thus back in command, Kang Sheng and Regiment 8341 back him. The 4FA faction now in command of the army has no alternative but to back him, regarded—still, after so long—as unsound potential counterrevolutionaries as they are. The obsequious and loyal Zhou Enlai backs him. Chen Boda and the other scribblers back him—again, they have no alternative, as their power rests on his approval. But the rest of the government? He is now not just responsible for the disasters of the Great Leap Forward and the Great Famine that followed, but now of those of the Cultural Revolution. Any half credible administrator-communist with the backings of a major network would be preferable, in the eyes of the Old Hundred Name Cadres. And there is such a person: Lin Biao.</p><p>And so Mao then purged Lin Biao.</p><div><hr></div><p>But great mysteries remain:</p><p>What, exactly, happened to all the friends and clients and allies of the purged high cadres, to all those lower down? A great many cadres and students were sent out to the countryside for years, and a great deal of property and artifacts smashed, and the military took over the running of things (to the extent that things were run, rather than have commune bosses as unsupervised feudal lords), and then as the party structure was rebuilt the military and the party "ran things".&nbsp;</p><p>How things actually ran between 1968 and 1974 is not really clear to me. Did people just get up in the morning, and do what they had done yesterday? And occasionally some PLA or Party representative had showed up at random and said "do this instead"? And how were the more-than-one-million displaced by the Cultural Revolution kept in the rustication places they were put? There weren't that many jails or concentration camps—certainly not on the GULAG scale—were there?</p><p>Usually during such authoritarian elite-replacement episodes—even Stalin's—the purges hit the high officials and all those one and two levels down whom the center suspects, but the bulk of the actual apparatus of governmental officials and economic bosses remains in place, with disorder at the center affecting them only in that they keep their heads down as their patrons fall, and then some of them get promoted. But precisely because of "Bombard the Headquarters", the Cultura Revolution was a different kind of thing, and I still do not understand what kind of thing it was.</p><div><hr></div><p>And what happened, exactly, after Lin Biao was gone, and his first- and second-rank network loyalists had all been sent to the countryside to learn from the peasants and the workers? Yes, all of the now-ruling members of the coalition under Mao are “weak”, without thick network support of their own, and Mao wants to keep them that way. The 4FA faction is brought into the PSC bigtime, with Ye Jianying and Li Desheng. The 87-year-old Long-Marech veteran Dong Biwu joins the PSC. Scribbler Zhang Chunqiao replaces purged scribbler Chen Boda. Zhu De is brought back into the PSC. And Wang Hongwen is promoted from many levels down to be #3 in the hierarchy, behind Zhou Enlai, who finally receives the promotion to #2 he had spent his life trying to avoid.</p><p>But how does such a weak PSC—without individuals with strong networks—govern the country? And even though they are all weak, and none of them (except Zhou Enlai, a puzzle) could have threatened to send Mao back into semi-retirement, surely a skillful and ambitious politician could have used a seat on the PSC to rapidly gain strength. 1975 sees Hua Guofeng also promoted from many layers down, and promoted to #2 as Zhou Enlai approaches the grave. </p><p>And it is at this point that Mao brings back Deng Xiaoping—and then purges him again, when it becomes clear that he (or, rather, him and the memory of Zhou Enlai) has a supernetwork, not just within but without the party, can bring the masses—Old Hundred Names—back onto the stage of history and into Tienanmen for the Qingming Festival. That is too great a power for Mao to tolerate on the PSC. That neither Wong Hongwen nor Hua Guofeng show any signs of being able to bring the masses into Tienanmen for Qingming preserves them. But they then have neither within-party network nor Cult of Personality power.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42d1efa-0205-42b4-b8a4-401e6b6472af_2332x850.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42d1efa-0205-42b4-b8a4-401e6b6472af_2332x850.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42d1efa-0205-42b4-b8a4-401e6b6472af_2332x850.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42d1efa-0205-42b4-b8a4-401e6b6472af_2332x850.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42d1efa-0205-42b4-b8a4-401e6b6472af_2332x850.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c42d1efa-0205-42b4-b8a4-401e6b6472af_2332x850.png" width="1456" height="531" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c42d1efa-0205-42b4-b8a4-401e6b6472af_2332x850.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:531,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2679291,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42d1efa-0205-42b4-b8a4-401e6b6472af_2332x850.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42d1efa-0205-42b4-b8a4-401e6b6472af_2332x850.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42d1efa-0205-42b4-b8a4-401e6b6472af_2332x850.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42d1efa-0205-42b4-b8a4-401e6b6472af_2332x850.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Mao then balances his PSC factions against the Gang of Four. And Mao then dies.</p><p>So what is left? And at the decisive moment, what you really need is to have Marshall G.K. Zhukov—or, rather, 4FA Marshals Ye Jianying and Li Xiannian on your side, plus Wang Dongxing, head of the 9th Bureau and thus commander of the 8341 Regiment.</p><p>And then they have to reknit the government so that it can actually, you know, govern. I think I pick up the threads. Chinese élite politics after Mao’s death is driven by the facts that (1) the 4FA veterans have command of the army, (2) scribblers and young technocrats have no deep networks of support, (3) the Gang of Four has no thick network of party supporters (4) 4FA veterans had to have been very loyal to Mao—they had, after all, no place else to go—but they choose because of their history to be loyal to Deng, and (5) princelings (with the important exceptions of Li Peng, Xi Jinping, Liu Yandong, Li Yuanchao, Yu Zhengsheng, and Bo Xilai) are kept from promotion to the high leadership, out of the fear that their network connection webs will then make them “overmighty subjects”. </p><p>Those facts promote Deng. Those facts then allow Deng to maneuver, with his lieutenants—three in particular: Xi Zhongxun to figure out how to lead opening-up to the world, Zhao Ziyang to figure out agricultural reform, and Hu Yaobang to modernize the CCP and so allow China to stand up—to guide China. Those facts then—when Hu and Zhao are purged for not being solid enough on the power monopoly of the CCP—create the space for the promotion of the “always nice” Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, and then of Hu Jintao and Wu Bangguo.</p><p>Highly recommended. It makes a lot clear that had been cloudy to me. Not, mind you, that I feel I understand it well…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>
