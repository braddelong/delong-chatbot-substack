CONDITION: First Day of School

Over zoom, to a class of students:

Barry [Eichengreen] already cited my line about how when the course goes well you [students] talk, 
and when the course goes badly we [professors] talk. He threatened you with a final exam if you do 
not do the reading beforehand, and participate actively, with the idea of making this class into a 
true discussion dialogue seminar, rather than a lecture. I now threaten you with making you write 
weekly memos on the current weeka€™ s
reading, due before the class begins, as a way to a€ceencouragea€D reading and preparation for 
thoughtful discussion.

But we're going to start by treating everyone, all of us, as adultsa€’’assuming that it's all going 
to work, and it's all going to work well.
Unfortunately, that just does not work on the first day.

It is psychologically and sociologically next to impossible to get people to do serious amounts of 
reading before the first day of class. Thus, almost invariably, first-day discussions about 
readings go over like lead balloons. I would be eager to be proved wrong todaya€”to have this turn 
into a discussion. Right now, however, I'm envisioning that this first class is simply going to 
turn into a lecture. But you all are going to do the reading for
the first week over the course of the next week, right? And if there is interest, we will take time 
next week to include short discussions of the papers on the first week of the reading list.

Note that it is not just that this course goes well in the sense that it is more fun if you 
discuss, and badly if we lecture.

It is also the case that if we lecture, maybe 10% of what we say becomes durably engraved on your 
neuronal patterns, and becomes part of your intellectual panoply on which you can draw in the 
future. And if it becomes a genuine, interactive, broad-based discussion, it becomes a truly 
marvelous and wonderful thing. People remember 90% of it. Afterwards, people speak of it as an 
intellect-changing experience.
But what we are, we are. And if we cannot move heaven and earth, we still do what we can, here in 
this fallen sublunary sphere, here at the start of the third year of the third millenniuma€™ s 
first global plaguea€!
