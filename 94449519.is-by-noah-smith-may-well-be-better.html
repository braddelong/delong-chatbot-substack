The <strong>second magic</strong> is at the small group-collective level: ears and mouths that allow us to talk using <strong>language</strong>, and so the band of fifty of so East African Plains Apes becomes an anthology intelligence: what one knows, soon all know.</p><p>Then comes the <strong>third magic</strong>, which is Noah’s first: the artificial memory and communication device that is <strong>writing</strong>, and all of a sudden it is not just the band of fifty that is an anthology intelligence, but potentially all humanity in the present and the past.</p><p>The <strong>fourth magic</strong> is a magic of coordination: How do you get us all in harness, pulling in the same direction, but each doing our (relatively specialized) part? The fourth magic is <strong>gift-exchange</strong>, that in its hypertrophied form turns into the market economy. Doing favors for one another, in a social context in which there must br approximate balance, is what allows us to, collectively, not just know things but do things.</p><p>After that comes, as Noah correctly notes, the <strong>fifth magic</strong> of <strong>science</strong>: the experimental method, and the exaltation of ideas not because they solidify the band or help some élite run a force-and-fraud exploitation-and-domination game, but because the ideas are true and are a univeral remote control—they enable us to understand and hence control the universe.</p><p>Those five magics have brought us where we are today.</p><p>Now how likely is it that we are now at the cusp of a <strong>sixth magic</strong>: predictive accuracy, generalization, and control without any simple intermediating laws, abstractions, or encapsulations, based simply on the fact that we have a huge amount of data, and can thus classify situations very finely by looking at what the situations’ nearby neighbors are?</p><p>On the one hand, I feel that this must be true—I find it very hard to imagine what our brains, or, say, a dogs’ brains, are doing in wetware other than this. On the other hand, our computers are still a lot less sophisticated than our brains, and it is unclear if Moore’s Law will get us to computers of sufficient complexity, and unclear if we can do as good a job of programming our computers as evolution has done at programming us.</p><p>But you really do need to subscribe to <a href="http://noahpinion.substack.com">Noah Smith</a>…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>MUST-READ:</h2><p>I confess I was disappointed that nobody noticed this little microblog I did.

In this model, the natural rate of unemployment is the rate at which the actual rate of nominal wage increase is equal to the warranted rate, and thus depends on the level of the real wage—with a lower real wage sustainable only with a higher natural rate of unemployment.\n\nYou can understand this as a distributional conflict: total demands for production greater than 100% of supply, and so attaining a feasible equilibrium requires one of:\n\n1. diminishing other groups' claims on income and so pushing real wages up enough that nominal wage increases demanded are at the nominal warranted rate of wage increase.\n2. raising the unemployment rate enough that nominal wage increases demanded are at the nominal warranted rate of wage increase.\n3. accepting an inflation rate higher than the central bank's target, and thus achieving feasibility via the exploitation of workers' short-run money illusion.\n\nIf you take this approach, I think it becomes clear that Blanchard and Glasner are talking past each other, and are not really disagreeing...&quot;,&quot;audience&quot;:&quot;all_subscribers&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;media_assets&quot;:[],&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://uneasymoney.com/2023/01/01/you-say-potato-i-say-potahto-you-say-tomato-i-say-tomahto-you-say-distribution-i-say-expectation/?utm_source=post_embed&quot;},&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:16879,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Brad DeLong&quot;,&quot;previous_name&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ea5ae644-9822-4ca5-ac6b-e18c017d8fbc_1189x1208.png&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Author of Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the 20th Century (forthcoming Sep 06), sometime Deputy Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, old-school weblogger, UC Berkeley economic historian&quot;,&quot;profile_set_up_at&quot;:&quot;2021-04-22T17:45:51.845Z&quot;}}"></div><p>There is an interesting debate between <strong>David Glasner &lt;</strong><a href="https://uneasymoney.com/2023/01/01/you-say-potato-i-say-potahto-you-say-tomato-i-say-tomahto-you-say-distribution-i-say-expectation/">https://uneasymoney.com/2023/01/01/you-say-potato-i-say-potahto-you-say-tomato-i-say-tomahto-you-say-distribution-i-say-expectation/</a>&gt; and <strong>Olivier Blanchard </strong>going on:</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/ojblanchard1/status/1608967176232525824&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;1/8.
