James Tobin was right in 1970: to the extent that there was a correlation between monetary aggregates and GDP (there hasn't been much of one in recent decades), Friedman had the causation reversed &lt;<a href="https://t.co/eNwlXAyLu8?amp=1">https://jstor.org/stable/1883016</a>&gt;.</p><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/delong">Brad DeLong: 'Live long, &amp; prosper!'</a>: </strong>The consumption function work was good—albeit overstated. "Incomes from Professional Practice" on the role played by the AMA and the state bar associations in boosting doctors' and lawyers' incomes and keeping them high is very good. "Roofs or Ceilings?" is at least half right: markets ration the available supply by (ability to pay) x (relative intensity of demand); price controls ration available supply some other way, and send a signal to profit-seeking capital to shift investment resources elsewhere. I don't think F&amp;S have it right but their principal targets have it very wrong indeed. Cf. the "grain supply" debate in France in the late 1700s, which is actually more sophisticated in elements than F&amp;S.</p><p>It's the "Keynes was wrong: you don't need a 'somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment" to balance the macroeconomy; all you need is a k% growth rule for M2" is where he went really wrong—he was smart enough to have thought up Goodhart's Law all by himself, but never did. And the political-economy rent-seeking society posturing was much more embarrassing than insightful.  In my view, Milton Friedman has the defect of a hedgehog whose one big trick is not, in reality, a very good one. And there are grave dangers in trying to do research when you know what the conclusions are, and the task is only how are you going to. manage to get there. </p><p>His work is best approached best the way I always approached Martin Feldstein's: we know what the conclusion will be, and he has done us the useful service of laying out the strongest argument you can make for that conclusion. But as a mode of training Friedman's way of proceeding turned a lot of people who could have been second-rate economists into fourth-rate ones.   Remember Jagdish Bhagwati (no left-winger—rather, a man who, appallingly, claimed TCJA would pay for itself!) on life at Friedman's Chicago...</p><p>We have not mentioned that the “night watchman” state is itself a very powerful enterprise, able to make and enforce its own judgments about who “owns” what against not just against roving bandits, but local notables and even its own functionaries. Friedman’s minimal state is not so minimal, after all: It rips the economy out of society, and gives each individual control over their economic resources rather than finding themselves tied down like Gulliver in what they can do with their "property" and so subject to the sociological network of domination and hierarchy. Friedman’s minimal state is not so minimal, after all.</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/2021-06-29-twitter-milton-friedman-threadeader.pdf">https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/2021-06-29-twitter-milton-friedman-threadeader.pdf</a>&gt; </p><p></p><p></p><p>2021–05–13 U.S. Inflation Outlook&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/kr/podcast/0514-in-focus-2-inflation-concerns-in-us-following/id1038822609?i=1000521665790&amp;l=en">https://podcasts.apple.com/kr/podcast/0514-in-focus-2-inflation-concerns-in-us-following/id1038822609?i=1000521665790&amp;l=en</a></p><p><strong>Per Krusell &amp; Tony Smith</strong>&nbsp;(2014):&nbsp;_Is Piketty’s “Second Law of Capitalism” Fundamental?_&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529012920/http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/piketty1.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20150529012920/http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/piketty1.pdf</a></p><p><strong>Per Krusell</strong>&nbsp;(2014):&nbsp;<em>Krusell och Smith: Därför köper vi inte Pikettys prognos</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://ekonomistas.se/2014/05/29/krusell-och-smith-darfor-koper-vi-inte-pikettys-prognos/#comments">https://ekonomistas.se/2014/05/29/krusell-och-smith-darfor-koper-vi-inte-pikettys-prognos/#comments</a>&gt;</p><p>====</p><p>====</p><p>VIDEO</p><h1>====</h1><p>====</p><p><strong>Author</strong>:&nbsp;<em>public-files/lecture-notes-marx.pdf at master · braddelong/public-files</em>: ‘… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/lecture-notes-marx.pdf">https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/lecture-notes-marx.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Paul Krugman</strong>:&nbsp;<em>‘Urp. I don’t think economics is failing;</em>&nbsp;in many ways I think it’s better than ever. But that aside, this gets the history of communication in the field all wrong. Tyler conveys the impression that we went straight from The General Theory to Twitter. I was there for a lot of the transition, and that’s not how it went. The truth is that not much economic discussion has taken place through books for a very long time. In fact, even journal articles have long been tombstones—things you had to publish for tenure, but lagging far behind the discussion. Even pre-internet communication mainly took place via working papers, which had completely taken over all the fields I worked in by the 1980s. No peer review, and obvious privileging of people with known names and connections, but still an effective dissemination system. Econoblogging in its heyday was also an effective system for disseminating ideas; it has been largely crowded out by Twitter, which is unfortunate, but many have found workarounds. In particular, a lot of econ Twitter is summaries of and links to working papers. So it isn’t actually casual and sloppy; more like abstracts for serious work. And the work is indeed serious, with tough questions and debate, informed by data, taking place in real time. Traditional peer review has fallen on hard times. But the quick back and forth among people who know their field serves a similar purpose, and maybe better. Think of the 2010–13 debate over fiscal policy; I’d stack that against any great econ debates of the past. And how anyone can look at the current arguments over fiscal policy, or minimum wages, or unemployment benefits and say that economists have become too cautious and polite baffles me… LINK: &lt;</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1396857404789243905&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;And how anyone can look at the current arguments over fiscal policy, or minimum wages, or unemployment benefits and say that economists have become too cautious and polite baffles me. 8/&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;paulkrugman&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Paul Krugman&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Mon May 24 15:55:32 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:26,&quot;like_count&quot;:183,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1396857404789243905" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/paulkrugman.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @paulkrugman" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">Paul Krugman </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@paulkrugman</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">And how anyone can look at the current arguments over fiscal policy, or minimum wages, or unemployment benefits and say that economists have become too cautious and polite baffles me. 8/</div></a><a class="tweet-link-bottom" href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1396857404789243905" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><span class="tweet-date">3:55 PM ∙ May 24, 2021</span><hr><div class="tweet-ufi"><span href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1396857404789243905/likes" class="likes"><span class="like-count">183</span>Likes</span><span href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1396857404789243905/retweets" class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">26</span>Retweets</span></div></div></a></div><p>&gt;</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman</strong>:&nbsp;<em>’As I read it,</em>&nbsp;there are two propositions being suggested. 1.

And as good to live 15 degrees south of the Huai River as to live 10 degrees north? The feel (and I could well be wrong) as that at some point somebody said: “This is very important, but it won’t get published without a statistically significant headline finding.
