The-Fed-Has-Got-This? (e) Who is on Team Hit-the-Economy-on-the-Head-with-a-Brick? (f) What 
inflation rate do we want to support economic reopening? (g) What inflation rate do we want to 
support the sectoral rebalancinga€”towards goods production, &
towards the deliverator economy? (h) How would expected inflation get embedded in the labor market

Larry Summersa€™ s arguments very carefully.

7. Noah Smith finds that he is much more in accord with Larry Summers than he thought he would be.
