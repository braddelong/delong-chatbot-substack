supports for the discussion I hope the class will have, rather than the skeleton of and an aide

• Today a NAND gate is 100 nm3

• We could fit 5 x IO16 NAND gates inside one of
these

• Bottom Line:

• We produce commodities much more cheaply

• But we also produce very different commodities

• Commodities that could not have been produced
at any price in 1960 are incredibly cheap today

him...

• Interested in everything—except economic
growth

• Scroll I of his Politics

• “household management" = oiko-nomos =
economics

• In order: bossing slaves, raising children,
directing your wife, knowing market
conditions

And This Is the Lot of Humanity

Unless...

A household... [needs] property as instruments for
living. And... a slave is living property.... If every
tool could accomplish its own work, obeying or
anticipating the will of others, like the statues of
Daidalos,                                  or the tripods of Hephaistos, which, says
the poet Homer, “of their own accord entered the
assembly of the Gods;” if, in like manner, the
shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the
lyre without a hand to guide them, chief workmen
would not want servants, nor masters slaves...

These were us far finished, but the elaborate ear
