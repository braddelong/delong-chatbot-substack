But they always do discharge it. Nothing anybody who is a manager does is private, in the sense that one can say: ‘This is my own affair. It does not concern anybody else. What I do is, therefore, of no real interest to anybody.” Managers are on the stage, with the spotlight on them…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/peter-f-drucker/9781647820275/10394/OEBPS/xhtml">https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/peter-f-drucker/9781647820275/10394/OEBPS/xhtml</a>&gt;</p><p>The young Peter F. Drucker was one of the more more interesting young moral philosophers in early 1900s Vienna all of whom brushed up against one another. Peter F. Drucker, however, then when came to the United States followed a very different trajectory (after getting Karl Polanyi his job at Bennington College) than any of the others. He became the U.S.’s BOSS management consultant and managerial theorist. But he remained someone who always hunted the same game as the Polanyis, von Hayek, Schumpeter and company. Pinned between Schumpeter, von Hayek, Karl Polanyi, and the shadow of Karl Marx, Peter F. Drucker sought his reconciliation of the antinomies of modern industrial society in the figure of the manager, whose social role was precisely to arrange things so that society could be an “association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all”.</p><p>Note that Drucker's manager is in many ways the polar opposite of Alasdair Macintyre's. Macintyre's is the pursuer of instrumental rationality on behalf of his principals, whatever their values and interests may be. Drucker's manager is the trustee of civilization, a member of a Michael Polanyian-type priestly profession in which one works not so much for one's principals as for the smooth, efficient operation of the system as a whole in a way that makes sense to and reconciles the interests of all stakeholders: freedom and community, efficiency and equity, order and disruption are then reconciled through the judgments and values of this particular honorable professional castes of managers.</p><p><strong>Alasdair Macintyre</strong>, <em>After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory, </em>South Bend: University of Notre Dame Press, 1981 &lt;<a href="https://books.google.com/?id=9sQcnQAACAAJ">https://books.google.com/?id=9sQcnQAACAAJ</a>&gt;.</p><div><hr></div><p>4) A very good introduction to this idea as applied to science and technology is chapter 5 of Partha Dasgupta, <em>Economics: A Very Short Introduction,</em> Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007, pp. 90-99 &lt;https://books.google.com/?id=9nsRDAAAQBAJ&gt;.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>…public interest and public liberties as well…</em>: Suppose I wanted to drop a footnote: ’If my editors would let me, here I would also trace the current of 20th-century thought and action for which Michael Polanyi, born in 1891 in Budapest, is a convenient marker: how society needs not just the decentralized mercenary institution of the market and definitely does not need comprehensive central planning (which can never be more than a fiction), but needs as well decentralized fiduciary institutions, focused on advancing knowledge about theory and practice, in which status is gained by teaching and learning from others—institutions like modern science, communities of engineering practice, communities of legal interpretation, honorable journalism, evidence-based politics, and others—and in which people follow rules that have been half-constructed and have half-emerged to advance not just the private interest and liberties of the participants but to advance the broader public interest and public liberties as well. And at the end of that I would drop a reference to where people should go to read further. What would the single best reference to drop be?</p><p>An answer from Nicholas Gruen:</p><p><strong>NIcholas Gruen</strong>:&nbsp;<em>‘It’s a tricky question</em>&nbsp;because Michael Polanyi was a chemist, then an economist and then a philosopher. His only important publications in economics proper are are his first, which was the first to show how little the Soviet economic expansion was funding improved living standards, and&nbsp;<em>Full Employment and Free Trade</em>, which outlines a neoliberal (i.e. minimally interventionist) Keynesianism with which some of the Mont Pèlerin Society were enamoured of—like Gottfried Haberler who wrote a preface to its second edition. The issues you’re raising are probably best expressed in <strong>Michael Polanyi</strong>’s 1941 piece “The Growth of Thought in Society”,&nbsp;<em>Economica</em>, 8:32 (Nov. 1941) &lt;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2550108">https://www.jstor.org/stable/2550108</a>&gt;. </p><p>‘I think his attempt to distinguish public from private liberty was a fine idea first articulated in this piece—though it never caught on. It’s another way to cut different aspects of liberty as Berlin’s ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ is. The odd thing however—it’s certainly puzzled me, is that MP doesn’t really spend much time on the professions. His categories for the occupations that both nurture and require ‘public liberty’ are those pursuing transcendent values: Science: Truth; The law: Justice; Art: Beauty; Religion: God. I came upon Polanyi after I’d come to the kind of view you sketch out there—that led me to write this essay—citing Alasdair MacIntyre and the importance of the values of professions: &lt;<a href="https://griffithreview.com/articles/trust-competition-delusion-gruen/">https://griffithreview.com/articles/trust-competition-delusion-gruen/</a>&gt;. </p><p>‘But on this Michael Polanyi is largely silent.

Moreover, he saw in the workings of that community the core principles and practices of the good political republic, as spelled out in his famous essay, ‘The Republic of Science’. There is, however, a tension between his political theory and his epistemological contribution, in particular his path-breaking writings about the tacit dimension in knowledge formation—or what he described as ‘personal knowledge’. On the one hand, his political essay supports a classical conservative position, while on the other, his theory of tacit knowledge anticipates much of the post-modern radical critique of long-standing Enlightenment assumptions about scientific objectivity and the disinterested pursuit of knowledge. This otherwise contradictory position can be understood by following Polanyi's own epistemological prescription, namely by examining the underlying assumptions that constitute his own tacit knowledge. Polanyi's personal history reveals the less-apparent assumptions tacitly underlying his republic of science. Polanyi's own ‘fiduciary community’—in particular, his deep personal and intellectual ties to classical conservative theory, his association with Frederick von Hayek, and his membership in the neo-liberal Mont Pelerin Society—shaped his theoretical conceptualization of the so-called ‘republic of science’. In this way, Polanyi's political contribution diverges from his own epistemological requirements, in a way that largely obscures important intellectual roots required to properly interpret his political thought…”</p><p>I should also mention Karl Polanyi’s wife Ilona Duczynska, the youngest member  of Lenin’s “Zimmerwald Circle” during World War I, and Karl and Michael Polanyi’s sister Laura (“Mousie”): <strong>Judit Zapor</strong>: <em>Laura Polanyi 1882-1957: Narratives of a Life</em>: ‘Although we have no way of confirming the actual steps she had taken, it seems that Laura Polanyi had been instrumental in her daughter [Eve]`s eventual release [from the Soviet GULAG]; no small feat, given the times and circumstances. As an unintended by-product, Eva Striker's imprisonment served as the inspiration for her childhood friend, Arthur Koestler`s novel, <em>Darkness at Noon</em>. The series of subsequent dramatic events included Laura Polanyi's own arrest by the Gestapo in Vienna in the aftermath of the Anschluss, and ended with her eventual success in helping her three children, her seventy-year-old husband, numerous nephews, nieces and friends to reach America. The one tragic failure concerned her younger sister, Sophie, who, with her husband and two of their three children, perished in concentration camps… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="http://polanyi.bme.hu/folyoirat/1997-02/1997-14-laura_polanyi.pdf">http://polanyi.bme.hu/folyoirat/1997-02/1997-14-laura_polanyi.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>And, on Ilona Duczynska: <strong>Kari Polanyi Levitt</strong>, <em>Rosa Luxemburg Lecture</em>: “Let me begin with my mother, Ilona Duczynska: if I were a believer, I would know that my mother was smiling down upon me here at the podium of the Rosa Luxembourg Foundation. My mother was a student of engineering in Zurich in 1915, when she was befriended by a community of representatives of the Russian Social Democratic Party opposed to the war, including Lenin, his wife Krupskaya and Angelica Balabanoff. Together with delegations from Germany, France, and Britain, as well as other European Labour and Socialist parties, they met to draft a program of action against the war, known as the Zimmerwald Declaration.</p><p>“As an 18-year-old Hungarian-speaking student unknown to any informant, Ilona was entrusted with delivering this call to action to the leaders of the Social Democratic Party in Vienna. When she presented herself to these gentlemen, they took one look at her and told her to go home, child, just go home. Having failed in this mission, she proceeded to Budapest where she received a warmer welcome from Ervin Szabo - a leading anarchist and head of the public library. With his counsel and advice, she found other young people to participate in a plan to distribute anti-war literature. She wrote the texts, found the printer and together with her comrade Tibor Sugar, they organized the distribution of leaflets in the great Weiss Manfred war factory and the army barracks.</p><p>“Eventually they were caught, imprisoned and charged with treason – it was not a small matter. The trial of Duczynska, a beautiful young woman from a very good family, and Tibor Sugar, who was briefly her partner in marriage before she met my father, aroused considerable public interest. They were liberated from prison by the 1918 revolution which terminated the war and established the first Hungarian Republic. Ilona was a founding member of the Hungarian Communist party, at that time largely composed of young people. With an excellent education and knowledge of several languages, she was called to Moscow to serve as translator to Karl Radek in the preparations for the historic Second International Congress of Communist Parties. Ilona returned to Vienna in 1920, and subsequently was expelled from the party for “Luxembourgist deviations” and a publication in a journal edited by Paul Levi, who also fell into disfavor with the party. As a young woman in her early twenties, she must have admired Rosa Luxembourg, who was a generation older, as a very important and senior figure in the movement.</p><p>“Many years later, following the destruction of the Austrian working class movement in February 1934, my mother rejoined the Communist Party in order to continue the struggle of the now-illegal Schutzbund, the military arm of the Austrian Social Democratic Party, until 1936 when she joined my father and myself in London. Subsequently, she was expelled from the Austrian Communist Party in London on orders from Moscow. No reasons were given.</p><p>“My mother was a very independent person and my father adored her. Karl and Ilona first met in 1920, at the Helmstreits Muhle, a villa provided as a refuge for political exiles from Hungary, by a Viennese well-wisher. My father left Budapest in 1919, and was soon joined by a larger exodus of communists, socialists, radicals and liberals following the accession of the reactionary regime of Admiral Horthy. The comrades in the villa were of my mother’s generation, and my father, who was 10 years older, would sit by himself, quietly writing. In a letter he wrote much later in life about meeting my mother, he said that she was a revolutionary and her name was Polish, and that was close enough to his ideal of the Russian revolutionary young woman. Ilona recalled that he seemed like a person whose life was behind him…</p><p>LINK: <em>&lt;</em><a href="https://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/Veranstaltungen/2014/script_lecture_polanyi-levitt_140508.pdf">https://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/Veranstaltungen/2014/script_lecture_polanyi-levitt_140508.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>See also: <strong>Linda McQuaig</strong>&nbsp;(2001):&nbsp;<em>All You Can Eat: Greed, Lust, &amp; the New Capitalism</em>&nbsp;(New York: Penguin Books) &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/allyoucaneatgree00mcqu/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/allyoucaneatgree00mcqu/mode/2up</a>&gt; pp. 124–160.</p><p>And then there was their fascist cousin Ödön Pór:</p><p><strong>Guido Franzinetti</strong>: <em>Ödön Pór: From Socialism to Fascism, from Hungary to Italy</em> &lt;<a href="http://italogramma.elte.hu/wp-content/files/Guido_Franzinetti_Odon_Por.pdf">http://italogramma.elte.hu/wp-content/files/Guido_Franzinetti_Odon_Por.pdf</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>5) <strong>Charles Kindleberger</strong>, <em>The World in Depression, 1929-1939</em>, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1973, pp. 291-2 &lt;<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=q4k2TgQLk_sC">https://books.google.com/books?id=q4k2TgQLk_sC</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>6) Margaret MacMillan, <em>Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World</em>, New York: Random House, 2001 &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=EHzgiYw0kegC&gt;.</p><div><hr></div><p>7) Laura Spinney, <em>Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World</em>, New York: PublicAffairs, 2017 &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=-A9uDgAAQBAJ&gt; </p><div><hr></div><p>8) Wladimir S.
