Trump’s language became increasingly violent during Oval Office meetings as protests in Seattle and Portland began to receive attention from cable new outlets. The President would highlight videos that showed law enforcement getting physical with protesters and tell his administration he wanted to see more of that behavior, the excerpts show. “That’s how you’re supposed to handle these people,” Trump told his top law enforcement and military officials, according to Bender. “Crack their skulls!”… The fact that General Mark Milley resisted Trump’s commands is both heartening and disturbing. After all, the line separating democracy from military intervention in domestic politics shouldn’t have to depend on military leaders keeping their oath to the Constitution. There should be other safe-guards in place. Trump’s presidency shows how weak those safeguards are. Since Trump’s departure from the White House, a rift has opened up between the American right and the military. Republican politicians like Senator Tom Cotton and Congressman Matt&nbsp;Gaetz have taken to calling the military “woke” or infected with “critical race theory.”… Milley offered a spirited defense of studying critical race theory and other radical intellectual traditions…. It’s hardly a coincidence that the right now sees the military as the enemy. After all, they disobeyed Trump and were the major barrier for Trump carrying out his plans, both during the protests of 2020 and during the January 6 riot. The current right wing campaign is clearly designed to cow the military and make it more obedient, with one eye on the next Republican president. The crisis of American democracy that started under Trump isn’t over. The Trumpists are trying to reshape institutions to destroy the restraints that held them back…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK:</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:38007548,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://jeetheer.substack.com/p/the-right-versus-the-military&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:null,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Time of Monsters&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/177b3ccd-6c39-4531-8c9c-588efa332fcd_1280x1280.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Right Versus the Military  &quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Throughout Trump’s presidency there was a running debate on the left about fascism.

Politically… the most important thing is to appeal to older normies with moderate views….. Socially, the most important thing is to fight with leftists about who’s a sellout…. That encourages the adoption of edgy, radical-sounding rhetoric when in most contexts, the best thing to do is to appeal to old-fashioned American values like freedom, property rights, and the dream of abundance while reassuring everyone that if you like your detached single-family home you can keep it. The rhetorical turn that I think has been unhelpful here is that I often see reform proposals framed as an effort to “abolish single-family zoning.” In left-wing activist circles, people like to try to associate themselves with the movement to abolish slavery, in part because abolishing slavery was really good and in part because “if we’d listened to people like you we’d have never abolished slavery” is a popular lazy rebuttal to voices calling for caution and political pragmatism. So you often end up in motte-and-bailey situations where people will say they are prison abolitionists, but then when you ask what should happen to serial killers they concede they’ll be involuntarily confined, just under circumstances so different from what prevails in the contemporary American prison system (Norway, say) as to constitute a form of abolition. This is a dumb way to do politics but some people find it entertaining, and a similar tic leapt into the land use conversation…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK:</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:39521210,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.slowboring.com/p/houses-not-zoning&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:null,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Slow Boring &quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec696af9-c7e4-4f1d-a582-6c0e5beffe69_768x768.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Single-family houses are great, single-family zoning is not&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Berkley, California is considering zoning reform, which is great.

Cornford</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Microcosmographica Academica</em>: ‘2. PARTIES: First, perhaps, I had better describe the parties in academic politics; it is not easy to distinguish them precisely. There are five; and they are called Conservative Liberals, Liberal Conservatives, Non-placets, Adullamites, and Young Men in a Hurry.A Conservative Liberal is a broad-minded man, who thinks that something ought to be done, only not anything that anyone now desires, but something which was not done in 1881–82. A Liberal Conservative is a broad-minded man, who thinks that something ought to be done, only not anything that anyone now desires; and that most things which were done in 1881–82 ought to be undone….The Non-placet differs in not being open to conviction; he is a man of principle. A principle is a rule of inaction, which states a valid general reason for not doing in any particular case what, to unprincipled instinct, would appear to be right…. The Adullamites are dangerous, because they know what they want; and that is, all the money there is going….. The Young Man in a Hurry is a narrow-minded and ridiculously youthful prig, who is inexperienced enough to imagine that something might be done before very long, and even to suggest definite things. His most dangerous defect being want of experience…. The Young Man in a Hurry is afflicted with a conscience, which is apt to break out, like measles, in patches. To listen to him, you would think that he united the virtues of a Brutus to the passion for lost causes of a Cato; he has not learnt that most of his causes are lost by letting the Cato out of the bag, instead of tying him up firmly and sitting on him, as experienced people do. O young academic politician, know thyself!…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/baked/micro.pdf">https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/baked/micro.pdf</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>John Stuart Mill</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Dark Satanic Millian Liberalism</em>: ‘[1] Mechanical inventions… have not yet begun to effect those great changes in human destiny, which it is in their nature and in their futurity to accomplish.
