Required Readings Note:

The required readings for Module 11 are rather longa€”but not nearly as long as for Modules 9 & 5, 
where I wound up taking two weeks per module.

There is Skidelsky chapter 6 
https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/readings/chapter-skidelsky-keynes-6.pdf. The 
chapters of Skidelsky before this one I've been all about how Keynes was smart and right. This
chapter is, from Skidelskya€™ s view as of 1995, as an enthusiastic advocate of the neoliberal 
turn, how Keynesa€™ s disciples were dumb and wrong. It is a very good analysis, on the level of 
events and ideas, of why people
decided to take the neoliberal turn.

77620200c/edit Frame your reading of it around these three quotes:

Anyone who wants to keep the spirit of Keynes alive has to face the failures of Keynesianism 
honestly, without always trying to shield the Master from the mistakes of the disciples. In 
essence, the
Keynesian revolution was ruined by over- ambition a€“ hubris might be a better word -driven by 
impatience and backed by unwarranted claims to both theoretical and practical knowledge. The 
monetarist
counter-revolution was a plea for more modesty, and greater trust in the spontaneous forces of the 
marketa€!

Keynesian policies come to us today wrapped up in a history of rising inflation, unsound public 
finance, expanding statism, collapsing corporatism, and general ungovernability, all of which have 
seemed
inseparable from the Keynesian cure for the afflictions of industrial societya€!. By the 1980s, 
Keynesa€! had joined Marx as the God that faileda€!

Keynesa€™ s star was fadinga€!. The Keynesian age had collapsed in theoretical disarray and policy 
disorder, victim of simultaneous inflation and unemployment which Keynesian economists could not
explain and Keynesian policy-makers could not control. It was in this situation that classical 
economicsa€! [that] Keynes had apparently overthrowna€! made a big comeback, and governments 
reverted to
a modified pre-Keynesian policy stance. Markets were deemed to be optimally self-regulating; the 
macroeconomic task of government was restricted to to maintaining a€~sound moneya€™;
governments™ s task in the micro-economy was to free up markets in order to lower the a€~natural 
rate of unemployments™ . The revival of classical economics and its theory of economic policyS!

Eichengreen: Globalizing Capital 5-7 
https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/readings/chapters-eichengreen-globalizing-5-6
-7.pdf tells the same story as Skidelsky ch 6 at much greater length, and with much more
focus on the international side. It, too, broadly approves of the neoliberal turna€”or at least 
regards it as inevitable. In EichengreenS™ s view, countries could not simultaneously (a) reap the 
benefits of market allocation of
investment capital and incentivization of savings, (b) stabilize their domestic economies, and (c) 
stabilize exchange rates so that they would not be massively vulnerable to international currency 
and financial markets. They could
not control, but had to submit to the market: the question was how best to do so.

Eichengreen when writing this version of GC (there is a later one) saw European countries as giving 
up their individual abilities to stabilize their economies (betting that recessions would be small, 
short, and infrequent) and other
countries as giving up exchange rate stability (in large part because half a century had taught 
that countries could not keep their promises to forever peg their currency to the dollar.)

I thought of making this Eichengreen reading optionala€’’indeed, I would recommend you skip it now, 
and read it during R&R week as review as an alternative to rereading Skidelsky ch 6.

In fact, let me make that recommendation stronger. The other outside reading is Eichengreen: 
Populist ch 8 https 
://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/readings/chapter-eichengreen-populist-8.pdf. It, 
too, goes over the
same grounds’’things falling apart, although BarryS™ s chapter title only echoes and does not copy 
Achebe https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/readings/book-achebe-things.pdf and 
Yeats
https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/readings/poem-veats-1919-second-coming.pdf 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Second Coming, (poem). One thing worth noting is where Barry 
quotes economist Sidney
Weintraub on the Carter years 1977-1981 that Carter had Soesucceeded S! where all DemocratsS”and 
RepublicansS”have failedS” namely, in making his own name a synonym for economic mismanagement and 
expunging
memories of Herbert Hoover dawdling at the onset of the Great DepressionSD. The extraordinary thing 
is that growth was faster in the Carter years than it was to be laterS”the only thing wrong was 
moderate inflation. And yet:
See AS BAD AS OR WROSE THAN HERBERT HOOVER! !a€D was the then-public reaction. The Trente 
Glorieuses had really raised the bar. (But then, somehow, the bar was immediately lowered 
againS”for the new
neoliberal order persisted.) This chapter is worth reading closely, as Barry gives a masterful 
summary of how, in the global north, neoliberal policies failed to deliver any notably good 
results, and few results at all except for an
enormous rise in income and wealth inequality, the creation of plutocracy, and the illusion of 
stability and low riskS”an illusion that was going to be brutally shattered in 2008.

And then there are the three DeLong chapters. Usually you would be well-advised to pay close 
attention to what I have written. Perhaps not here. I am less confident that I have the right 
interpretation of these historical processes
than of the rest of this history. And I am less satisfied with the arrangement I have made of 
things. Chapter 19 https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/slouching-19-neoliberal- 
%23tceh.pdf is worth studying.

Chapter 21 is worth skimmingS ”1 am far from sure I have gotten the argument right here 
https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/slouching-21-cold-war-end-%23tceh.pdf. And 
chapter 22
https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/slouching-22-hvperglobalization-%23tceh.pdf 
is both repetitious and unfinishedS’T had hoped to have another draft for you by now, but I do not. 
I regret this.
