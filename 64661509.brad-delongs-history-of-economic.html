start?</em></p><p><strong>I start with a very crude global index of the value of the stock of human technology—useful ideas about manipulating nature and productively organizing humans—that have been discovered, developed, and then deployed-and-diffused throughout the world economy.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><em>How do you construct this index?</em></p><p><strong>I calculate it as the average worldwide level of income per capita, times the square root of population.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><em>Why “square root”?</em></p><p><strong>The square-root recognizes that there is resource scarcity—hence generating income for more people is burdensome, and so the technology level is not simply average output per capita—but also that each mouth comes with two eyes, two arms, and a brain, so that labor is productive—hence total world product is not the technology level either. “Square-root” is a balance.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><em>Would you die on the hill that it is square-root, rather than some other power between 0 (which gives average income per capita) or 1 (which gives total world product) multiplying population?</em></p><p><strong>No</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>What do your guesses—I won’t call them numbers—then show, in terms of the annual average proportional growth rates of technology deployed-and-diffused, worldwide?</em></p><p><strong>Roughly:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>2.1%/yr., at least, after 1870; the Modern Economic Growth era</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>0.45%/yr.

An economy that sees advertising supported information, entertainment, communication, and social network media—television and cable and all the rest—not as a generator of wealth but as an intermediate-good resource-consuming subtraction from wealth has something wrong with it. How wrong? I do not know. But that is why I say “at least”.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><em>What do you think about when the big, important qualitative change in the structures underlying human economic growth came?</em></p><p><strong>There are various arguments, innumerable arguments made…</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><em>Yes?</em></p><p><strong>Some date the Big, Important Change sometime in the 800 to 1500 time frame, with the formation of "western culture". Others date it to the 1500 to 1750 time frame, either with the Imperial-Commercial Revolution or through the coming of limited government. Then there are those who place it in the 1750 to 1870 time frame, the age of the Democratic and Industrial Revolutions. We are not going to resolve this.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><em>So what do you think?</em></p><p><strong>I have a very, very hard time dating the Big, Important Change that brings “modernity” to any moment before 1800.</strong></p><p><strong>First of all, whenever I look around the world after, say, the Middle Bronze Age—after -2000 or so—I see places around the world where the economies, societies, and polities of the urban hotspots of the civilization look pretty damned “modern” to me. I see urban, commercial, intellectual, and political slices of society that have elite politics characterized by various forms of checks and balances, bureaucratic military routinization, market economies, sophisticated divisions of labor, at least semi-rational inquiry into causes and effects, and the application of knowledge to problems of production. These modern sectors have a much lower information density and knowledge stock than did western Europe in the 1600s, and the upper class has a much lower scale of material power over nature, and they float on top of an enormous exploitation-and-extraction apparatus that holds the farmers and the craftsmen in an iron fist. But political institutions, cultural attitudes, market systems—they are there, they are just not dominant.</strong></p><p><strong>This means that when people look for a key watershed-boundary crossing, they have a hard time. They pick a moment, any particular moment—whether the first steam engine, or the Glorious Revolution of 1688, or Abelard’s publication of </strong><em><strong>Sic et Non</strong></em><strong>—and say “this switched us onto the track to modernity”, and it is easy for critics to respond by pointing out precursors all the way back to classical Athens, if not to the revolt after the death of Solomonof the North Kingdom of Israel against the House of David. So I placer the Big, Important Change very late—to when the entire package comes together, sometime after 1800.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><em>So when does the entire package come together?</em></p><p><strong>Maybe it comes together after 1800, with the deployment of the steam engine and automatic textile machinery and the consequent development of an engineering profession and a machine tool industry, a thing that brings us first the railroad and then the Second Industrial Revolution and everything else. That is definitely one possibility. But it is not the one I am most attracted to right now.</strong></p><p><strong>So what view of when the entire package comes together are you most attracted to right now?</strong></p><p><strong>I am most attracted to: after 1870, with the speed-up of technological growth to an average pace of 2.1%/year, and the consequent creation of a world rich enough and feminist enough to undergo the demographic transition and release humanity from ensorcellment by the Devil of Malthus.</strong></p><p><strong>Take all the changes and processes that had been going on before 1870, have them continue, and you find that you do not have anything like our modern world today.</strong></p><p><strong>Have technical change worldwide continue at its 1770 to 1870 pace after 1870, and you </strong><em><strong>maybe</strong></em><strong> have a world that runs into substantial resource scarcity as the really easy coal is mined out quickly. And even if you do not, well, an 0.45%/year rate of growth of technology is offset by an 0.9%/year rate of growth of population, and you get that rate of growth of population at a typical living standard of less than $5/day. Without the 1870 speedup and the coming of Modern Economic Growth, odds are we would have a Malthusian steampunk world today, with little sign of enough curbing of patriarchy and infant mortality to induce the demographic transition. Women would still be focused on using marginal resources to boost fertility, for a 1%/year population growth rate means that their number of surviving sons will be roughly Poisson(1.3), which means that more than ¼ of women will experience the social degradation involved in having no surviving sons and hence very little social power. Such a world is still, for more than half the world’s population, an Agrarian Age world.</strong></p><p><strong>And if technical progress worldwide were to have continued at its 1500 to 1770 pace after 1770, or its 800 to 1500 pace after 1500, we would be even worse off.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><em>Do tell…?</em></p><p><strong>We would, today, be in a gunpowder-empire world. Figure a world today with the technology level of 1850—but with a much higher population than in 1850, or a world today with the technology level of 1670—but with a higher population than in 1670. Such a world is not “modern”, but is still for the overwhelming bulk of people an Agrarian Age world.</strong></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/brad-delongs-history-of-economic?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/brad-delongs-history-of-economic?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:64839460,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/brad-delongs-history-of-economic-468&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:47874,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Brad DeLong’s History of Economic Growth Catechism, Part II&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;I greatly enjoy and am, in fact, driven to write Grasping Reality—but its long-term viability and quality do depend on voluntary subscriptions from paying supporters.
