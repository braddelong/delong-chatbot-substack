I count a number of things:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Watershed-Boundary Crossing of the Neolithic Revolution</strong> from -8000 to -6000: the invention of agriculture (and herding).</p></li><li><p><strong>The glacial pace of technological progress in the past</strong>—that over 1870 to 2010 we saw, in an average year, 200 times the proportional technological progress of the early Agrarian Age. (And, of course, growth from a much, much higher pace.)</p></li><li><p>Nevertheless, <strong>the large cumulative magnitude of technological progress in the past</strong>: as much from -6000 to 1870 as from 1870-2010.</p></li><li><p><strong>The acceleration of growth in the early Agrarian Age</strong> -6000 to the year 1: literacy matters for making humanity an anthology intelligence composed not just of those alive today but also of the dead, and two heads are better than one for solving problems.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Late-Antiquity Pause</strong> from 1 (actually 150) to 800—I at least would have expected another doubling of the rate of progress after the year 1, which would have carried H up to 0.65 by 800 and then possibly put the world at the cusp of the Industrial Revolution, but we did not attain that level of H until 1770.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Mediæval Recovery</strong> of technological progress to something like its pre-pause norm (but with the year 800 seeing five times the human population of the year -1000, why wasn’t there faster growth in H than in the -1st millennium?).</p></li><li><p><strong>The Watershed-Boundary Crossing of the Imperial-Commercial Age</strong> step-up in growth over 1500 to 1770.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Watershed-Boundary Crossing of the British Industrial Revolution Age </strong>from 1770 to 1870.</p></li><li><p>As noted already, at great length, the <strong>Huge Watershed-Boundary Crossing of the Modern Economic Growth</strong> from 1870 to 2010.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Population Explosion and Demographic Transition</strong> from 1770 to 2100.</p></li><li><p><strong>Whatever is going on now</strong>—if global warming and other problems do not interrupt Modern Economic Growth, what do we have to look forward to for the world of 2100?</p></li></ol><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank"
