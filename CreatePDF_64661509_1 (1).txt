Brad DeLonga€™s History of Economic Growth Catechism, Part I

Where do you start?

I start with a very crude global index of the value of the stock of human technology a€’’useful 
ideas about manipulating nature and productively organizing humansa€”that have been discovered, 
developed, and then deployed-and-diffused throughout the world economy.

How do you construct this index?

I calculate it as the average worldwide level of income per capita, times the square root of 
population.

Why a€cesquare roota€ET

The square-root recognizes that there is resource scarcitya€’’hence generating income for more 
people is burdensome, and so the technology level is not simply average output per capitaa€”but 
also that each mouth comes with two eyes, two arms, and a brain, so that labor is 
productivea€’’hence total world product is not the technology level either. a€oeSquare-roota€D is a 
balance.

Would you die on the hill that it is square-root, rather than some other power between 0 (which 
gives average income per capita) or 1 (which gives total world product) multiplying population?

No.

What do your guessesa€”I wona€™ t call them numbersa€”then show, in terms of the annual average 
proportional growth rates of technology deployed-and-diffused, worldwide?

Roughly:

• 2.1 %/yr., at least, after 1870; the Modern Economic Growth era

• 0.45%/yr. 1770 to 1870; the Industrial Revolution era

• 0.15%/yr. 1500 to 1770; the Imperial-Commercial era

• 0.05%/yr. 800 to 1500; the High MediAIval era

• 0.015%/yr. 150 to 800; the Late-Antiquity Pause era

• 0.06%/yr. -1000 to 150; the Axial-Iron age

• 0.03%/yr. -3000 to -1000; the Literacy-Bronze age

• 0.018%/yr. -6000 to -3000; the Early Agrarian era

• 0.009%/yr. -8000 to -6000; the Early Neolithic era

• 0.003%/yr -48,00 to -8000; the Out of Africa-Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic eras

Basically, growth very slow for millenniaa€’’visible only in la longue JurA©ea€”then growth visible 
over a human lifetime, barely, after 1500; growth substantial over a human lifetime after 1770; and 
then growth so that humanitya€™s technological prowess doubles every generation after 1870.

What do your guesses show, in terms of the levels of technology deployed-and-diffused, worldwide?

Roughly:

• 2020: 25.4, Today

• 2010: 20.6, End of the Neoliberal era

• 1870:1.0, Shift to the Modern Economic Growth age

• 1770: 0.64, Industrial Revolution age

• 1500: 0.43, Imperial-Commercial age

•  800: 030, MediAIval age

•  150: 0.27, Classical Antiquity

• -1000: 0.136, Early Iron age

• -3000: 0.074, Early Literacy-Bronze age

• -6000: 0.043, Neolithic era

• -8000: 0.036, Late Mesolithic era

• -48000: 0.011, Out-of-Africa-Paleolithic era

The proportional jump from 1870 to 2020 is larger than the proportional jump from -6000 to 1870. 
Surely the jump from 1 to more than 20 deserves some intermediate steps?


I am playing with:

• 2035: High Information Age

• 2002: Global Manufacturing Age

• 1969: Mass Consumption Age

• 1936: Mass Production Age

• 1903: Industrial Age

• 1870: Steampower Age

• 1605: Imperial-Commercial Age

• 135: High Classical Antiquity (ancient, asiatic, feudal)

• -1300: Late Bronze-Literacy Age

• -4000: Early Agrarian Age

• -15000: Mesolithic Era

with each a€cemode of productiona€D marking a rough doubling of the technology level. If you 
believe that a€oethe hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with 
the industrial capitalists□, then the list above are what you would like to mark and reference: not 
any of this a€oeasian-ancient-feudal-capitalist-socialista€D stuff.

Do you really think that the technological-underpinning base and the corresponding superstructures 
of human society really stayed the same in any meaningful sense from 200 to 1500?

No. I take the point that back in the Before Times smaller quantitative changes in the level of 
productivity had larger qualitative effects on how societies were runa€”that smaller changes in the 
forces- and relations-of-production carried with them bigger effects on the superstructure, at 
least in the long run
If, before 1500 we move to dividing history up into a€oemodes of productions□ by marking an age 
difference as a roughly a's2-ing in our valuation of the stock of deployed-and-diffused 
SoetechnologySD:

• 1125: High MediAIval Age (feudal, asiatic)

• 135: High Classical Antiquity (ancient, asiatic)

• -450: Early Classical Antiquity (bronze, axial)

• -1300: Late Bronze-Literacy Age

• -2400: Early Bronze-Literacy Age

• -4000: Early Agrarian Age

• -6000: Early Neolithic Age

• -15000: Mesolithic Era

• -30000: Upper Paleolithic Era

Okay. Anything more to say about periodization?

Not right now, no.

Then let us move on: Why do you set the technology level proportional to the level of average 
output per capita?

That is just a normalization: it makes it easy to interprets’’double the technology level, and you 
double the average income per capita level the worlda€™s resources can support at a fixed 
population.

What does this measure tell us about when the big, important quantitative change in the course of 
human economic growth came?

It tells us that the big leap upward in economic growthS”the bit watershed 
boundary-crossingS’’comes in 1870, when the global rate of technological progress jumps up more or 
less discontinuously from an average proportional growth rate of 0.45% per year to a rate of at 
least 2.1% per year.

Why the "at least"?

Because the standard statistical measures disturb me: they assign very little economic value to a 
huge range of activities, starting with the invention of radio, that absorb a huge proportion of 
our leisure time, our attention, and our concert. An economy that sees advertising supported 
information, entertainment, communication, and social network mediaa€’’television and cable and all 
the resta€”not as a generator of wealth but as an
intermediate-good resource-consuming subtraction from wealth has something wrong with it. How 
wrong? I do not know. But that is why I say a€oeat leasta€D.

What do you think about when the big, important qualitative change in the structures underlying 
human economic growth came?

There are various arguments, innumerable arguments madea€!

Yes?

Some date the Big, Important Change sometime in the 800 to 1500 time frame, with the formation of 
"western culture". Others date it to the 1500 to 1750 time frame, either with the 
Imperial-Commercial Revolution or through the coming of limited government. Then there are those 
who place it in the 1750 to 1870 time frame, the age of the Democratic and Industrial Revolutions. 
We are not going to resolve this.

So what do you think?

I have a very, very hard time dating the Big, Important Change that brings a€oemodernitya€D to any 
moment before 1800.

First of all, whenever I look around the world after, say, the Middle Bronze Agea€”after -2000 or 
soa€”I see places around the world where the economies, societies, and polities of the urban 
hotspots of the civilization look pretty damned a€oemoderna€D to me. I see urban, commercial, 
intellectual, and political slices of society that have elite politics characterized by various 
forms of checks and balances, bureaucratic military
routinization, market economies, sophisticated divisions of labor, at least semi-rational inquiry 
into causes and effects, and the application of knowledge to problems of production. These modern 
sectors have a much lower information density and knowledge stock than did western Europe in the 
1600s, and the upper class has a much lower scale of material power over nature, and they float on 
top of an enormous exploitation-and-
extraction apparatus that holds the farmers and the craftsmen in an iron fist. But political 
institutions, cultural attitudes, market systemsa€”they are there, they are just not dominant.

This means that when people look for a key watershed-boundary crossing, they have a hard time. They 
pick a moment, any particular momenta€’’whether the first steam engine, or the Glorious Revolution 
of 1688, or Abelarda€™s publication of Sic et Nona€”and say a€oethis switched us onto the track to 
modernitya€D, and it is easy for critics to respond by pointing out precursors all the way back to 
classical Athens, if not to the
revolt after the death of Solomonof the North Kingdom of Israel against the House of David. So I 
placer the Big, Important Change very latea€”to when the entire package comes together, sometime 
after 1800.

So when does the entire package come together?


iviayoe it comes rogeiner aner law, witn me deployment or me steam engine ana automatic textile 
macninery ana me consequent aeveiopment ot an engineering profession ana a macnine tool inaustry, a 
tning mat orings us nrst me ranroaa ana men me aecona inaustriai Revolution ana everytning eise. 
mat is aennneiy one possiniuiy. nut n is not me one i am most attraciea to ngnt now.

So what view of when the entire package comes together are you most attracted to right now?

I am most attracted to: after 1870, with the speed-up of technological growth to an average pace of 
2.1%/year, and the consequent creation of a world rich enough and feminist enough to undergo the 
demographic transition and release humanity from ensorcellment by the Devil of Malthus.
Take all the changes and processes that had been going on before 1870, have them continue, and you 
find that you do not have anything like our modern world today.

Have technical change worldwide continue at its 1770 to 1870 pace after 1870, and you maybe have a 
world that runs into substantial resource scarcity as the really easy coal is mined out quickly. 
And even if you do not, well, an 0.45%/year rate of growth of technology is offset by an 0.9%/year 
rate of growth of population, and you get that rate of growth of population at a typical living 
standard of less than $5/day. Without the 1870
speedup and the coming of Modern Economic Growth, odds are we would have a Malthusian steampunk 
world today, with little sign of enough curbing of patriarchy and infant mortality to induce the 
demographic transition. Women would still be focused on using marginal resources to boost 
fertility, for a 1%/year population growth rate means that their number of surviving sons will be 
roughly Poisson(13), which means that more
than A1^ of women will experience the social degradation involved in having no surviving sons and 
hence very little social power. Such a world is still, for more than half the worlda€™s population, 
an Agrarian Age world.

And if technical progress worldwide were to have continued at its 1500 to 1770 pace after 1770, or 
its 800 to 1500 pace after 1500, we would be even worse off.

Do tella€\?

We would, today, be in a gunpowder-empire world. Figure a world today with the technology level of 
1850a€”but with a much higher population than in 1850, or a world today with the technology level 
of 1670a€”but with a higher population than in 1670. Such a world is not a€oemoderna€D, but is 
still for the overwhelming bulk of people an Agrarian Age world.
