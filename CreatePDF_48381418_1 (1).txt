CONDITION: Structural Sexism:

An actual statistical count of something we had all noticed:

Markus Eberhardt & al.: Stereotyping in the Economics Job Market: a€~ Women are a€oehardworkinga€n, 
men are a€oebrillianta€na€! <https://voxeu.org/article/stereotyping-economics- job-market>

This leads to a dilemma. As one of my colleagues said at one of our internal meetings as to what 
the messaging should be as we tried to get our graduating Ph.D. students jobs, the message that 
a€oehe is really brilliant, even though the core of his dissertation is somewhat of a messa€O is an 
effective (and often true) message in getting potential employers to look at men, but ineffective 
(even though often true) message in getting potential employers to look at
women.

So what should we do in this situation that we are in?

Thanks for reading this. And please share it far and wide, if you think it worth reading!

First: The Fed Has Done an Amazing Job!

Pause for a second, and just look at what the Powell-Brainard Fed (with a major assist from the 
Biden administration, and earlier from the Pelosi caucus in the House driving income support) has 
accomplished:

How this recession compares with previous ones

Percent change in employment since the most recent peak.

Note: Because employment is a lagging indicator, the dates for these payroll employment trends
are not exactly synchronized with the National Bureau of Economic Research’s official business
cycle dates.

Worlds, worlds, worlds better than the Bernanke Fed and the Obama Administration. Worlds better.

And has this come at a cost? Leta€™ s see. What are forecasters thinking about the likely 
trajectory of inflation? Here is Mark Zandi:

Inflation Will Moderate As Pandemic Fades

Consumer price inflation, annualized % change

Inflation has peaked. This, despite tomorrowa€™ s blaring headlines on January consumer price 
inflation. Inflation peaked in October when the Delta wave of the pandemic was doing its maximum 
damage to global supply chains and keeping millions of sick workers off the job.

And what does the bond market think about the future outlook:

FRED — 5-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate

3.5

3.0


Since 2010 the bond market has, always, doubted that the Federal Reserve will achieve its inflation 
target over the next five years. Now, for the first time, it expects inflation over the next five 
years to be a cumulative 1.5%-points above the target. That implies a little above-target inflation 
in the next few months, and then over the following four years inflation at or below target.
The bond market is strrrrrooonnngggly on team a€oeinflation is transitory'a€oe and team a€oethe Fed 
has got thisa€D.

This is a huge, tremendous policy victory on so many fronts.
So why does Paul Krugman avoid taking a victory lap here?

Paul Krugman: Can the Fed Let Us Down Easy?'. a€~American workers are quitting at record rates, 
suggesting that theya€™ re confident they can easily find new jobs. Wages are rising rapidly, 
suggesting that labor currently has a lot of bargaining powera€!. Inflation is running 
uncomfortably higha€!. Ita€™ s time for the Federal Reserve to cool things downa€!. Can the Fed 
pull this off without sending us into a recession? It will be
trickya€!. Hitting desired economic targets is hard, even when the fundamentals are on your 
sidea€!.Therea€™ s a pretty good chance that the Fed can let us down easya€!

Interview: Ryan Petersen, founder and CEO of Flexport

For the last year or so, the global economy has been hammered by a massive supply chain crunch. The 
phenomenon is impossibly complex, encompassing a dizzying array of factors a€” demand shifts, the 
shift to e-commerce, Chinese industrial crackdowns, Covid, inflation, legacy regulations, trade 
imbalances, and much much more. But a small moment of clarity aa€l

Paragraphs:

Izabella Kaminska: Why Rogan Is the Mediaa€™ s a€oelnverted Yield Curved€\3- The Blind Spot: a€~The 
TLDR: Rogana€™ s mass appeala€”much larger than that of the legacy media a€”feels like a market 
breakdown. It simply shouldna€™ t be happening. Ita€™ s the inverted yield curve of the media 
industry. Or the snubbing of structured data in favour of the unstructured sort. Neither should 
make sense, so when they manifest it signals something
significant: the market is favouring inefficiency over efficiency. The question is why?a€! Does 
that mean I disagree with long, largely unedited, formats? No. I think ita€™ s fine to be long and 
ramblinga€!. But Rogana€™ s mass popularity is upsettinga€!. With it, the long-held assumption that 
a€oemainstream media valuea€D resides in filtering, refining and editorialising information for the 
sake of sensemaking is also being testeda€!. Inverted yield curves
are distress signals precisely because they shouldna€™ t exist. They appear because therea€™ s a 
wedge in the balancing mechanisma€!. My experiences with communist Poland inform my views a lot on 
this. Ita€™ s worth remembering that anyone suggesting the dockersa€™ strikes in Gdansk were a 
substantial force to be reckoned with in the 1980s, would also have been labelled disinformation 
agents by the state. Yet we know what happened next. That
inverted information yield curve led to system revolution and system collapse. Leta€™ s hope this 
time round we can work together to avoid total destabilisationa€!
