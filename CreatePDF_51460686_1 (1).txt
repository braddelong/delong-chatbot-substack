FIRST: A Note on Housing Unaffordability in America:


Why is housing so unaffordable in America today? Yes, NIMBYism. But there is more:

Housing Starts, Single and 2+ Unit Structures

We Are Only Now at Normal, after 15 years of sub-normality in construction:

• Single-family housing starts fluctuated around 1,200,000 a year for a generation and a halfa€!

• Then the mid-2000s booma€!

• Then the crash before the Great Recessiona€!

•  (Note: the housing crash did not cause the Great Recessiona€”the economy had rebalanced out of 
housing and into other sectors before the recession began)a€!

• Then the most Ainemic recovery in housing imaginablea€!

• Why so Alnemic a recovery ?a€!

•  My guess: the U.S. Treasury kept saying it was going to reform housing finance and the GSEs, so 
people waited to seea€!

• And the U .S. Treasury never did soa€!

• The post-2007 shortfall in housing construction relative to that a€oenormala€n is immensea€!

•  The post-2007 shortfall is 4/3 as deep and more than twice as wide as the extra housing 
construction of the mid-2000s booma€!

•  That means that the anti-boom is three times as many houses not built (relative to the 1.2M/year 
a€oenormala€n pace) as extra houses built during the booma€!.

•  Is it any surprise that as soon as people feel they have enough wealth to extend themselves, 
housing real estate prices float upward?

on the dangers of social networks to children. The campaign, which is sadly consistent with the

Hi everyone, Today Ia€™ d like to teach you an interesting skill: How to read (and maybe write) 
ROT13! I taught myself how a while ago, and I thought the process was illuminating, and maybe you 
will too. Should you learn this skill? No, absolutely not. There is no reason to learn to read 
ROT13. It is at best useless, and if you ever actually encounter ROT13 a€!

The Bazaar of War: a€™ln the early hours one July morning [in 1712], a long column of men, horses, 
and carts makes an abrupt change of course. They march swiftly through the predawn darkness to make 
a surprise attack, one which after eleven long years of war will decide the fate of Europea€”the 
Battle of Denain!a€! <

The Bazaar of War @bazaarofwar

There is one other problem. During the siege of Le Quesnoy, the commander of the British contingent 
Ormonde is ordered to withdraw. He does so reluctantly and takes the English troops with him, but 
most of the Hanoverians and German mercenaries remain behind.

Paragraphs:

I continue to be remarkably surprised at how short the memories of economic journalists in America 
are. Why is not everybody remembering how bad the recovery was 10 years ago? Why is not everybody 
writing about how incredibly grateful they are for the rapid recovery of our job marketa€”even 
though it does come with some inflation?:

Colby Smith & Peter Wells: US Economy Gained 431,000jobs in March as Tight Labour Market Persists'. 
a€~Unemployment rate falls to 3.6%a€!. For every unemployed person in the US there are roughly 1.7 
openingsa€!. January and February payrolls were revised higher by a combined 95,000a€!. Average 
hourly earnings registered a 0.4 per cent monthly gain, translating to a 5.6 per cent increase from 
the same period last yeara€!.
The share of Americans either employed or looking for work has crept higher, but remains shy of 
pre-pandemic levelsa€! the labour force participation ratea€! 62.4 per cent. In February 2020, it 
stood at 63.4 per centa€!

Against yet another form of NIMBYism: that buildings should be bespoke and expensive always and 
everywhere. I would not have thought the architectsa€™ lobby was that strong?:

Randy Nishimura: In Praise of5-Overa€“l Buildings'. a€~Achieving near-high-rise densities at a 
wood-frame price is a winning formula. 5-overa€“l constructional is a cost-effective means to 
builda€l. The density associated with four, five, or even six floors of housing above a 
street-level commercial podium contributes toward the kind of vitality associated with good 
urbanisma€!. I have no problem with their abundancea€!. I also
take no issue with how similar many of the projects appear to bea€l. I see no reason why any single 
5-overa€“l project should even need to be an architectural standout. Every city needs 
a€cebackgrounda€D buildings that comprise the urban fabric, shape the public realm, and 
collectively define the character of a communitya€l. Being a€oea little boringa€D favors simplicity 
and plainness, but at the same time we should build to last.
With wood-framed construction this requires care. Excessive complexity (i.e., lots of joints and 
corners) is a recipe for water infiltration, so embracing simplicity and plainness can be 
strategical. Eugenea€! can aspire to be the best mid-rise city possiblea€l. These buildings 
comprise a viable means to radically improve the urban realm and address market demandsa€l

How is it that I have never heard of this project by Justin Yifu Lin before? Mark this as a tickler 
then I need to learn much more about this:

Jordan Schneider: Chinese Industrial Policy: How A City Turned Itself Into a VC Fund'. a€~Peking 
Universitya€™ s Institute of New Structural Economics (INSE)a€! founded by Justin Yifu Lin to 
promote New Structural Economics (NSE), a theory of economic development he developed during his 
tenure as the Senior Vice President and Chief Economist at the World Bank (2008a€“2012)a€! a 
a€oethird waya€D between the old-
school structuralist approach to economic development and neoclassical economics, Lin has toured 
developing countries across different continents offering his NSE advice on national development 
strategiesa€l. Hefei, the capital city of Anhui Province, located in the downstream of the Yangtze 
Rivera€l. The CCTV interview, a carefully scripted PR stunt, portrays Hefei as a city with a smart 
strategy of economic catching-upa€l
aggressively soliciting firms to relocatea€l most interestingly, and controversially^! Hefeia€™ s 
equity investment in pioneering tech firms through its municipal government-owned a€oeurban 
constructiona€n companya€!

I put a tickler in my files long to go to revisit this, and wonder at how bad things were in the 
public sphere during the Bush administration. But, really, they have not gotten any better since 
then, have they? Rather the reverse:

Brad DeLong: Why Oh Why Cana€™ t We Have a Better Press Corps?: a€~Matthew Yglesias points to the 
problem of Bob Woodward: "In Bob Woodwarda€™ s highly anticipated new booka€! President Bush 
emerges as a passive, impatient, sophomoric and intellectually incuriousa€!. Ita€™ s a portrait 
that stands in stark contrast to the laudatory one Mr. Woodward drew in Bush at Wara€l which 
depicted the presidenta€! as a
judicious, resolute leader, blessed with the a€~vision thinga€™ his father was accused of lacking 
and firmly in control of the ship of statea€!
