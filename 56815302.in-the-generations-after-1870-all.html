It destabilized politics and political economy around the globe. Shaky regimes crashed. Solid regimes became shaky. And rock-solid regimes began to feel earthquakes building:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Dominic Lieven</strong>: <em>The End of Tsarist Russia: The March to World War I &amp; Revolution</em>: ‘Although the Russian case is unique, in this respect too international comparisons are nevertheless very important. In the two generations before 1914, European society as a whole had been transformed more fundamentally than in centuries of earlier history. It was hard for anyone to keep his balance amid dramatic economic, social, and cultural change; predictions as to where change might lead in the future could inspire even greater giddiness…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/endoftsaristruss0000liev">https://archive.org/details/endoftsaristruss0000liev</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Before 1770, there were historical changes—political/military, literary/ideological/cultural, religious/social, and economic/technological. They worked on different time scales. Political/military affairs could overthrow orders and make new ones inside of a decade; literary/ideological/cultural required a generation; religious/social took a few centuries; and economic/technological took close to a millennium, at least. What that meant is that people might find themselves operating in a political/military context that might be brand-new, and in a literary/ideological/cultural framework that diverged from that of their parents, they still operated in a religious/social context that their grand- and great-grandparents would have found familiar, and there was barely any memory at all that there might have been a time in which the patterns of technology were substantially different. The fact that major changes in different realms proceeded along such different time scales had powerful consequences for how patterns of action and the institutions and orders that channeled them came under stress and were adopted in response. </p><p>From 1770 to 1870 the pace of economic change quickened. But it was really not the case that “all that was solid melts into air”. </p><p>That did not become true until after 1870.</p><p>But after 1870 it became true with a vengeance. And so over 1870-2010, repeated technological and economic revolutions shook, and shook, and shook the human world to pieces over and over again, and then people had to try to pick the pieces up and assemble them into something over and over again.</p><p>That was very different than all previous history.</p><div><hr></div><p>Not immediately relevant to the major point I want to make about what is truly different about the history of the 20th century, but very interesting anyway, is what immediately follows in Lieven’s book: his rant against “civil society”:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Dominic Lieven</strong>: <em>The End of Tsarist Russia: The March to World War I &amp; Revolution</em>: ‘…A common feature across Europe was the growth of civil society and its impact through the press, lobbies, and political parties on governments. In contemporary parlance, civil society is always supposed to be on the side of the angels. As regards international relations in pre–1914 Europe, this was not true. Civil society, meaning above all the press, often played a big role in stoking international conflict. This might be just a question of pandering to public prejudices and thirst for sensations, but it rattled and bedeviled policy makers nonetheless. </p><p>More serious were systematic efforts to use foreign policy as a means to generate nationalist support for governments at home, in the process undermining the rational calculations on which diplomatic bargaining was based. No great power, Russia included, was entirely innocent in this respect…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/endoftsaristruss0000liev">https://archive.org/details/endoftsaristruss0000liev</a>&gt; </p></blockquote><p>On the one hand, Lieven wants to take the side of sober statesman seeking the public good finding themselves overwhelmed by the irrational passions of the gutter press-stoked “mob”, using the old word for "uncivil society”. Consider Winston Churchill on the shift of Britain to anger, fear, and launching the pre-WWI naval Cold War against imperial Germany: “The [Liberal] government offered [to build] four [dreadnought battleships a year], the navy demanded six, and we compromised on eight”—because of pressure from civil society and the press.”</p><p>On the other hand, Lieven recognizes that “busy[ing] giddy minds with foreign quarrels”, in the words of Shakespeare’s King Henry IV Lancaster, is often the most convenient tactic that a shaky élite that is losing any legitimate social role can undertake to try to shore up its dominance. The classic statement, according to Count Witte, is supposed to be that of Czarist Interior Minister Plehve in a cabinet meeting: “Alexei Nikolaevich, you do not understand Russia’s internal situation. To contain the revolution, we need a short victorious war!” And the classic argument that this tendency was the major root of World War I is: <strong>Arno Mayer</strong> (1981): <em>The Persistence of the Old Régime: Europe to the Great War</em> &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/persistenceofold0000maye">https://archive.org/details/persistenceofold0000maye</a>&gt;.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/in-the-generations-after-1870-all?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/in-the-generations-after-1870-all?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Gideon Rachman</strong>: <em>Ukraine &amp; the Start of a Second Cold War</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/34481fbd-4ca7-4bb3-bef5-e68fefed7438">https://www.ft.com/content/34481fbd-4ca7-4bb3-bef5-e68fefed7438</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Michele Jamrisko</strong>: <em>Has Inflation Peaked?

Also the potential bad outcome here is that retail investors will get worse execution or won’t be able to trade for free, and I am not sure that the SEC would mind that…. GameStop….

My view: in some places, crypto does not have a plausible used case that is non-destructive, and in such places it needs to be regulated into near non-existence because it is a harmful grift; in other places, it may become a response to government failure and thus a useful safety valve.

Try telling that to policymakers in developing economies, where crypto has become a significant vehicle for avoiding taxes, regulations, and capital controls…. I am not suggesting that all blockchain applications should be constrained. For example, regulated stablecoins, underpinned by a central-bank balance sheet, can still thrive, but there needs to be a straightforward legal mechanism for tracing a user’s identity if needed…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/will-advanced-economies-ban-cryptocurrencies-by-kenneth-rogoff-2022-06">https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/will-advanced-economies-ban-cryptocurrencies-by-kenneth-rogoff-2022-06</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>It does seem that the only reasonable reaction to Ilya Shapiro's panicked dismay at the failure of Georgetown University to cancel him, and thus the prospect that he might actually <em><strong>have to do a job</strong></em>, is simply laughter:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Scott Lemieux</strong>: <em>I Can See by What You Carry that You Come from Bari-Town</em>: ’Ilya Shapiro…. “Georgetown University Law Center reinstated me last Thursday.

On the other hand, economic activity at the moment is still relatively “sunny.” Consumer spending is showing no signs of abating and supply chains may finally be starting to heal. Still, the Fed is not ready to reverse course and so rising interest rates are likely to put pressure on capital markets and, therefore, the economy…. Jamie Dimon…. "Look, I’m an optimist. I said there’s storm clouds, they’re big storm clouds, they’re—it’s a hurricane; it’s, we—right now it’s kind of sunny, things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle this. That hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way.
