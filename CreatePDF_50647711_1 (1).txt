Paragraphs:

Theda Skocpol used to lecture about how party-based associations in Pre-World War I Germany were an 
important source of social connection in the rise of the SPD. He did not stress how theya€”and 
oppositional working class
culturea€’’limited its appeal as well. The chickens certainly came home to roost in the 1930s. 
Which team are chickens are now roosting right now in Europe, with what looks like the collapse of 
its social-democratic parties. And the
chickens   are circling here in the U.S .A. as well:

Sheri Berman: Revisiting aCceCivil Society and the Collapse of the Weimar Republica€T2 a€~In this 
situation Germany a€™ s vibrant civil society did not strengthen or promote democracy. Indeed, the 
opposite
was the case; rather than reconciling the interests of different groups or bridging the cleavages 
in Germany society, civil society reinforced and deepened them. Socialists, Catholics, 
nationalists, and so on joined
their own hiking groups, bird-watching clubs, and community organizations, contributing to the 
formation of what one scholar called a€oeferociously jealous a€~small republicsa€™ a€U[3]a€”or what 
we would
today call social a€cebubblesa€D in German society. By helping to lock in social divisions and 
animosities, German civil society contributed to the weakening of the Weimar Republic, leaving it 
easier prey for
the Nazis during the Great Depression^!

I confess I do not understand what Scott thinks is different about today. In the past there was an 
argument that one reason we should give more resources to the rich is that it would incentivize 
them to work harder, plus that one reason we
should take away resources from the poor and the brown people was that it would incentivize them to 
work harder. Perhaps back in the 1950s they believed in this rationale. Certainly in the 1920s they 
did. But nobody after 1990 ever
looked at the data and then went out and, with a straight face, claimed that Reagan-Volcker 
policies had raised the rate of economic growth vis-a-vis the 1970s:

Scott Lincicome: Will the Culture War Dictate Republican Economic Policy?: a€~Botha€! seem not to 
recognize just how little policya€’’conservative, liberal, or some kind of a€oeTrumpiana€D hybrida€”
matters in the Stefanik/Cheney sagaa€!. Trump-supporting Stefanik actually voted with Trump much 
less often than Trump-critic Cheneya€!. The GOPa€™ s current (momentary?) elevation of Trumpa€”and 
the
culture war that he (still) leadsa€”above policy and principles extends beyond the Cheney-Stefanik 
situation and even made-for-TV dramas like Dr. Seuss. Instead, GOP a€cepolicya€D this year has 
repeatedly
been reverse-engineereda€”pick targets and then craft policy to effect thema€”to advance various 
Trump and culture war prioritiesa€!. Republican a€oeeconomic policy is now seen mainly as a cudgel 
against
cultural antagonistsa€Da€”and often in ways diametrically opposed to the conservative positions 
Republicans claim to holda€!. Either Republicans are keeping their policy priorsa€”tax cuts are 
still good,
current  U.S. union policies are bad, etc.a€”and just excepting certain corporate villains from the 
general rules, or they just never believed in those policies in the first place. Texas Sen. Ted 
Cruz, for his part,
seems   to have admitted the latter a few weeks ago in the Wall Street Journala€!

Animal spirits!

John Maynard Keynes (1936): The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money: a€~It is safe to 
say that enterprise which depends on hopes stretching into the future benefits the community as a 
whole.
But individual initiative will only be adequate when reasonable calculation is supplemented and 
supported by animal spirits, so that the thought of ultimate loss which often overtakes pioneers, 
as experience
undoubtedly tells us and them, is put aside as a healthy man puts aside the expectation of 
deatha€l. We should not conclude from this that everything depends on waves of irrational 
psychology. On the contrary,
the   state of long-term expectation is often steady, and, even when it is not, the other factors 
exert their compensating effects. We are merely reminding ourselves that human decisions affecting 
the future, whether
personal or political or economic, cannot depend on strict mathematical expectation, since the 
basis for making such calculations does not exist; and that it is our innate urge to activity which 
makes the wheels go
round, our rational selves choosing between the alternatives as best we are able, calculating where 
we can, but often falling back for our motive on whim or sentiment or chancea€!

This is an argument that looked very good back in 2005. But how good does it look now?

Thomas P.M. Barnett (2007): An Overwrought, Ideologically Myopic Argument: a€~China is no 
a€cenewa€D model or threat. It follows the model of Singapore, and before that South Korea, and 
before that
Japan: a single-party state that bases almost all of its legitimacy on rising income and 
development through export-driven growth. It is a self-liquidating model: eventually the society 
wants more political freedom
to                                                                                               go 
with that wealth. ChinaaC™ s just so fricking huge and so poor that this process isna€™ t going 
fast enough for Manna€!. Chinaa€™ s path is but a stepping stone to outcomes we naturally seek. I 
mean,
crawling might be described as an alternative to walking, but only until youa€™re able to walka€!. 
Chinaa€™ s a€cemodela€Da€! is about transforming a hugely rural, impoverished, disconnected society 
(one­
sixth of humanity) into an urban, consumeristic, connected one. Once achieveda€! its model 
self-liquidatesa€!. Confusing Chinaa€™ s influence-peddling with model propagation is a new 
academic fad in search
of actual dataa€!

Poor naA"ve New Dealer Henry Wallace:

Henry A. Wallace (1952): Where I Was Wrong: a€~Before 1949 I thought Russia really wanted and 
needed peace. After 1949 I became more and more disgusted with the Soviet methodsa€!. Fist were the
shocking revelations of the activities of Russiaa€™ s atomic spiesa€!. Next, I was deeply moved by 
reports of friends who had visited Czechoslovakia shortly after the Communist took controla€!. I 
labored under
the illusion that the Communists had beaten us to the punch in popular appeala€!. My analysisa€! 
failed utterly to take into account the ruthless nature of Russian-trained Communists whose sole 
objective was to
make Czechoslovakia completely subservient to Moscowa€!.. In 1948 I believed both Russia and the 
U.S. should take their troops out of Korea. Todaya€! I am sure it was a serious mistake when we 
withdrew
our troopsa€!. Russia is still on the march, and the question now is whether she will be able to 
take over all of Asia, including India and the Near Easta€!
