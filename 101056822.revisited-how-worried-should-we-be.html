Bradford DeLong</strong> (2023): “How Worried Should We Be About Rising Inflation?” <em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15206688">Journal of Policy Analysis and Management</a></em> 42:1 (Jan), pp, 305-322.  &lt;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22452">https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22452</a>&gt;</p><h2>Point/Counterpoint</h2><h4>Paul Decker &amp; Kevin Kelly, <em>Co-Editors:</em></h4><p>As we are well aware, U.S. inflation rates have been on the rise for well over a year now, reaching levels that are reminiscent of the 1970s. Consumers are experiencing rising prices in necessities like gasoline and groceries. These heightened costs led to the majority of voters reporting inflation as their primary issue of concern in the 2022 midterm elections. </p><p>However, not all experts agree on how worried the Americanpublic should be about these elevated inflation levels, or how long we might expect inflation to persist. While some notable experts, including former U.S. Treasury Sec-retary and Director of the National Economic Council Larry Summers, have warnedof an impending recession given the high rates of inflation, others have argued that current levels may not necessarily indicate longer-term problems. Given this visible concern and mixed messages about the level of worry we should feel about it, weturned to two macroeconomists to share their perspectives on the current trend in rising inflation rates and their expectations for what these rates mean for the future.</p><p>In this issue, Joshua Hausman of the University of Michigan notes that he anticipates current inflation rates will remain high in the near term, but what may bemore concerning is that political pressures could prevent the Federal Reserve from enacting policies to lower inflation, which could lead to persistent inflation rates above 4 or 5 percent.</p><p> In his response essay, J. Bradford DeLong of the University of California at Berkeley describes each of the past cases of high inflation in the U.S.to understand which of these cases might best parallel the current trend. He notes that current indicators like expectations in the bond market suggest that today’s caseis most similar to those in 1947 and 1951, which were relatively short-lived; however, he notes that uncertainty around the war in Ukraine could lead to a long-term inflationary spiral comparable to the 1970s. </p><p>To conclude the column, Hausman argues that while he agrees with much of DeLong’s commentary, he sees the 1970sas a better comparison to today’s case than 1947 or 1951, leading to a concerning longer-term outlook.</p><p><em>Journal of Policy Analysis and Management</em>, Vol. 42, No. 1, 305–322 (2023)© 2022 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.

I don’t want my headline to be misconstrued. The United States has an elected government with the responsibility of responding to unanticipated events, like a Chinese spy balloon slowly traversing the country over the course of several days. Assuming the preliminary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/us/politics/chinese-spy-balloon-shot-down.html">reporting</a> in <em>The New York Times</em> is accurate, the Biden administration handled the situation with the proper mix of gravity and deliberativeness. Could the president and his team have done things a little differently? Sure, probably. But for now, I don’t see grounds for any sweeping critique of their moves over the past week as the drama unfolded in the skies and on the ground. So when I use the word “unserious” to describe our country, I don’t mean to impugn the people running the show in Washington, let alone all Americans. But neither am I simply responding to cognitive toxicity on Twitter. That’s certainly a big part of it—but not just in the form of know-nothing anonymous accounts and troublemaking bots. I’m talking mainly about how the right responded to the balloon—on Twitter, but also in published articles, on cable news, on talk-radio programs, and in public statements…</p><p><strong>Duncan Black: </strong><a href="https://www.eschatonblog.com/2023/02/a-source-familiar-with-donald-trumps.html">A Source Familiar With Donald Trump's Thinking</a>: ‘Every few years "we" return to the discussion about overuse of anonymous sources, sometimes it gets some agreement from journalists and editors, they promise to do better for about 3 weeks and then "we" forget about it again for years. This isn't in response to anything that's happening at the moment, but there's no doubt in my mind that, for example, one of Maggie Haberman's close anonymous sources was Sarah Sanders, who would contradict things that Sarah Sanders would say on the lectern hours earlier. That political journalists *regularly* let people be anonymous sources about their own fucking thoughts is just crazymaking. For lots of reasons, but one is that of course only *some* people are granted the cover of anonymity for ridiculous reasons. That's a grant of power by the journalist to the "source," and not a power that is granted evenly.&nbsp;That's Governor Sanders, now.
