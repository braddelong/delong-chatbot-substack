But as Charles Goodhart had warned him, the correlations he relied on between the money stock and spending broke down as soon as central banks started to try to rely on them as control mechanisms. See Charles Goodhart, “Problems of Monetary Management: The U.K. Experience”, <em>Reserve Bank of Australia Papers in Monetary Economics</em> 1 (1975) &lt;https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-349-17295-5&gt;.</p><p>So Friedman then took refuge in a “you know it when you see it” position. In 2000 he said: “Japan[’s]… situation is very clear…. Monetary growth has been too low…. The Bank of Japan… [should] buy long-term government securities, and they can keep buying them and providing high-powered money until the high-powered money starts getting the economy in an expansion. What Japan needs is a more expansive domestic monetary policy…” quoted in Timothy B. Lee, “Milton Friedman Would Be Pushing For Easy Money Today”, <em>Forbes</em> June 1, 2012 &lt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2012/06/01/milton-friedman-would-be-pushing-foreasy-money-today/?sh=76b918545b16&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>10) Claudius Ptolemy, <em>Almagest</em>, Encyclopedia Britannica 1948 [150] &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=nAq6EGPo9jgC&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>11) Keynes, General Theory, ch.

Joe McCarthy had real power in the Republican Party in the first half of the 1950s—Trump’s hold on the party in the early 2020s is a reasonable analogy, for Republicans were as scared to cross McCarthy then as, say, Mike Pence is to cross Trump and condemn Trump for welcoming plans to lynch Pence on January 6, 2021. Republican Senate majority leader Robert Taft was quite a right-wing case in himself. The Republicans chose Eisenhower as their standard-bearer because they wanted to maximize their chances of winning. And Eisenhower devoted himself to curbing the crazy swamps. But even Eisenhower made the Democrats and the press do the heavy anti-McCarthy lifting. Plus Earl Warren in his old age turned out to be a very different kind of Republican than anyone before would ever have imagined he would or could be.</p><p>There is a counterfactual in which America’s politics of the 1950s looks a lot more like the Nixonian early 1970s—break the country in half and come away with the larger half—or the Trumpist late 2010s—break the country in half and come away with the smaller half.</p><div><hr></div><p>14) Thomas Piketty and Emmanual Saez, “Income Inequality in the United States”, <em>Quarterly Journal of Economics</em> Vol. 118 Is. 1 (February 2003), pp. 1-39 &lt;<a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/pikettyqje.pdf">https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/pikettyqje.pdf</a>&gt;.</p><div><hr></div><p>15) Nelson Lichtenstein, <em>The Most Dangerous Man In Detroit: Walter Reuther And The Fate of American Labor</em>, New York: Basic Books, 1995 &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=6TgdAQAAMAAJ&gt;.</p><div><hr></div><p>16) DeLong and Eichengreen, <em>Marshall Plan.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>17) Charles Kindleberger, <em>Europe’s Postwar Growth: The Role of Labor Supply</em>, Cambridge: Harvard University CFIA, 1967 &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=JYksAAAAMAAJ&gt;; Barry Eichengreen, <em>The European Economy Since 1945: Coordinated Capitalism and Beyond</em>, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1947 &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=M5V7SLSyZpoC&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>18) Marcel Mauss, <em>The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies</em>, New York: Routledge, 1990 [1950] &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=zxsiBQAAQBAJ&gt;.</p><div><hr></div><p>19) Robert Gordon, “Postwar Macroeconomics: The Evolution of Events and Ideas”, Cambridge; NBER, 2000 &lt;https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w0459/w0459.pdf&gt;.</p><div><hr></div><p>20) Richard Nixon, <em>Six Crises</em>, New York: Doubleday, 1962 &lt;https://books.google.com/books? id=3EkrcgAACAAJ&gt; </p><div><hr></div><p>21) Volcker and Gyohten, <em>Changing Fortunes</em> </p><div><hr></div><p>22) Burns, “Progress” </p><div><hr></div><p>23) Keynes, <em>Consequences</em>, p. 220.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/incomplete-draft-long-notes-to-chapter-272?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/incomplete-draft-long-notes-to-chapter-272?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/incomplete-draft-long-notes-to-chapter-272/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/incomplete-draft-long-notes-to-chapter-272/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>(Remember: You can subscribe to this… weblog-like newsletter… here:&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>There’s a free email list.
