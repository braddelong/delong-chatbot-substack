Suppose that you do have not general “overheating” but rather concentrated and specific “overheating” in particular sectors causing your inflation: Why should that lead you to moderate your contractionary monetary policy response. What argument would be that concentrated-and-specific is less likely to get baked into expectations of future wage inandprice increases. But why? The 1970s inflation was very concentrated-and-specific, and got very baked into future wage in price increases. The argument Paul does not seem to make—but that I think he believes—is that skewness-inflation is an essential part of desirable structural adjustment.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong—Paul is very smart. But the range of arguments deployed here is much thinner than I think it should be:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Paul Krugman</strong>: <em>Overheaters, Skewers &amp; the Nonlinear Economy</em>: ‘If demand is skewed… people are buying much more of some things than usual, but less of others, so some parts of the economy are running hot while others run cold… price increases in the booming sectors… outweigh price cuts in the slumping sectors, raising the average rate of inflation above what you’d expect given the overall level of demand…. We agree that both overheating and skewed demand are driving inflation, [but] their relative importance matters. If you think it’s mainly overheating, you want the Federal Reserve to slam the brake… maybe even pushing us into recession. If you think it’s mainly skew… you want a much milder response, easing off the gas pedal but mostly counting on supply and demand adjustments to bring inflation down. But an argument about relative magnitudes isn’t the same as a fight over fundamentals…. There’s far more consensus about inflation among serious thinkers than many people, including some of the participants in this debate, may realize…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2">https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>As I read through the flow of news about monetary policy, the state of the business cycle, and the recovery from the plague recession, I find myself frustrated by what seems to me to be a great deal of fuzzy thinking on the part of even the smartest analysts. It seems to me that the first question should be: "How can the Federal Reserve best accomplish its task of making Say’s Law true in practice even though it is false in theory?" If you start from that question, you get a different and I think better slant on things.</p><p>Back up: Say’s Law was the claim made by economist John Baptist say in 1803—later abandoned by him—that excess supplies of commodities in particular markets and of labor in particular sectors were necessary and good components of beneficial economic adjustment, and that we did not need to fear that excess supply would ever become pervasive and economy-wide and so destructive. Say was, as he realized eventually, wrong. Just as a competent government arranges the system of property and contract and compensates for Pigovian externalities (and performs a Beveridgean pre- or re-distributional adjustment of the distribution of wealth so that the societal well-being function the market maximizes aligns with society’s preferences), so it must also manage aggregate demand. A central bank’s place in aggregate demand is to manage the supply of <em><strong>money</strong></em>—in its triple role as liquidity, as safe-asset store savings vehicle for moving social power to command commodities into the future, and as a source of safety and security—to demand, so that there does not emerge the excess demand for <em><strong>money</strong></em> that is the flip side of general glut and of deep depression. We know that the central bank has successfully accomplished this money-management task when the real rate of interest in markets is in accord with the Wicksellian “neutral” real rate. </p><p>It was Paul Krugman’s genius back in 1999 &lt;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1998/06/1998b_bpea_krugman_dominquez_rogoff.pdf">https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1998/06/1998b_bpea_krugman_dominquez_rogoff.pdf</a>&gt; to figure out that when interest rates attain their zero lower bound, that is a powerful signal that, if more expansionary fiscal policy is off the table, the optimal macroeconomic outcome <em><strong>requires</strong></em> inflation: since liquid money and short-term government bonds have then become perfect substitutes as far as portfolio returns are concerned, standard open-market operations are neutral, and so aggregate demand can be affected only through the inflation-expectations channel. (What’s that? Quantitative easing? Very weak indeed.)</p><p>Yes, you can argue that monetary policy should aim not just at avoiding both a deflationary excess demand or an excess supply of money, but should also produce a stable yardstick for economic calculation. And you would be right to so argue. But then you are down to a matter of tradeoffs: how elastic a yardstick do you tolerate in return for doing your principal job of balancing the money market and so avoiding what used to be called a “general glut”? </p><p>Stable-yardstick considerations are counterbalanced by greasing-the-adjustment-process considerations: in an economy in which cutting your nominal wage is often viewed as a grave status insult, labor adjustment into expanding sectors requires that some wages rise while others remain constant. That imparts of an inflationary bias to optimal monetary policy. And the more is the amount of desirable structural change to be accomplished faster, the greater is that inflationary bias.</p><p>All of these seem to me to be essential pieces of any discussion of optimal monetary policy right now. Yet how rare is the take that manages to consider more than one of them!</p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Mariana Mazzucato</strong>: <em>What Is Economic Value, &amp; Who Creates It?</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXrCeiQxWyc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXrCeiQxWyc</a>&gt;</p><div id="youtube2-uXrCeiQxWyc" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;uXrCeiQxWyc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uXrCeiQxWyc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div><hr></div><h2>One Picture: French Nuclearization:</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b1c4f6-402a-4b7e-824a-7677e8463ae4_1162x594.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b1c4f6-402a-4b7e-824a-7677e8463ae4_1162x594.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b1c4f6-402a-4b7e-824a-7677e8463ae4_1162x594.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b1c4f6-402a-4b7e-824a-7677e8463ae4_1162x594.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b1c4f6-402a-4b7e-824a-7677e8463ae4_1162x594.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b7b1c4f6-402a-4b7e-824a-7677e8463ae4_1162x594.png" width="1162" height="594" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b7b1c4f6-402a-4b7e-824a-7677e8463ae4_1162x594.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:594,&quot;width&quot;:1162,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:428667,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b1c4f6-402a-4b7e-824a-7677e8463ae4_1162x594.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b1c4f6-402a-4b7e-824a-7677e8463ae4_1162x594.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b1c4f6-402a-4b7e-824a-7677e8463ae4_1162x594.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b1c4f6-402a-4b7e-824a-7677e8463ae4_1162x594.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Alan Cole</strong>: <em>Five Reasons the Sanctions Are Working</em>: ‘In lieu of a military response, Biden and his allies are waging economic war on Putin’s Russia.
