WHAT?!</p><p>The big reason why Britain’s Conservative Party is in trouble right now is precisely economic idiocy—that Brexit’s effect on GDP was dire, and that the GDP was, in fact, owned by the heckler in Newcastle:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sebastian Payne: </strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/09dc03f4-e280-4089-a3ad-7b5d55f9b850">To woo voters, Rishi Sunak must fix the UK’s ‘palpable economy’</a>: ‘The Tories may be desperate to boost the economic data, but everyday signs of improvement will be more important: High streets are filled with boarded-up shops, public services are verging on collapse and there’s a spiralling wave of strikes: It was one of the most famous soundbites of the Brexit campaign. In a debate on the economic impact of leaving the EU, a heckler in Newcastle shouted at a university professor, “That’s your bloody GDP, not ours”. As Rishi Sunak will soon discover, many Britons still feel the same…. What they care about is what you might call the “palpable economy” — the one that really touches people, as opposed to the data-driven one. Sunak needs to focus on the general state and mood of Britain: does the country feel more prosperous than it did at its lowest economic ebb (ie: right now), are the high streets improving, are job opportunities plentiful? And are public services working well? Were there to be an <a href="https://www.ft.com/uk-general-election">election</a> in the next six months, the answers to all these questions would be negative…</p></blockquote><p>There are second-order arguments about the <em><strong>distribution</strong></em> of that GDP, and there is a dog-in-the-manger aspect to the Conservative Party’s base not wanting to see anyone they do not regard as deserving prosper. But the ditinction between the “palpable” and the “data-driven” economy simply does not exist. Add up all the instances of the palpable economy and you get the data-driven one:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/but-gdp-is-the-palpable-economy-aggregated?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/but-gdp-is-the-palpable-economy-aggregated?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Iryna Voichuk: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/IrynaVoichuk/status/1598371689670316045">“Today is the first day of winter</a> and I want you to watch this video of Christmas <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mariupol?src=hashtag_click">#Mariupol</a> as it was a year ago, when the city and its residents didn’t yet know what awaited them in 2 months…</p></li><li><p><strong>China Charts: </strong><a href="https://www.realchinacharts.com/p/long-view-energy-chips-war-making">LONG VIEW: Energy, Chips, War-Making Capacity, and Taiwan</a>…</p></li><li><p><strong>Gillian Tett: </strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/68cbf8a2-051d-4123-a0a9-dba14d5dea6d">https://www.ft.com/content/68cbf8a2-051d-4123-a0a9-dba14d5dea6d</a> New York is staring at a dangerously divided future... esembles not just the face of America but an extreme microcosm of its challenges....
