[BioNTech-Pfizer] BNT162b2 mRNA Covida€“19 Vaccine

RESEARCH SUMMARY

Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine

F.P. Mac*, et at DOI: 1010%/NEJM<M20J4577

CLINICAL PROBLEM

Safe and rtfrctisv vaccines Do prevent severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and

COvid-19 are urgently needed. No vaccines that pnxca
against betocuronanrusc* arc currently available. and
mRNA-based vaccines hair not been widely tesred.

CLINICAL TRIAL

A randomized. double-blind study of an mRNA vaccine
encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.


43.548 participants 216 years old assigned to

wore the vaccine or placebo by intrarnuKubr infection
on day 0 and day 21. Participants were followed for
safety and for rhe development of symptomatic Covid-19
foe a median of 2 months.

I»K$ULT$

Safety:

Vaccine recipients had local reactions I pain, erythema,
swelling) and systemic reactions (e.g.. fever, headache,
myalgias) at higher rates than placebo recipients, with
more reactions following the second dose. Most were
mild                      ro moderate and resolved rapidly.

Efficacy:

The vaccine showed protection 7 days after the second
dose: 95% efficacy was observed.

LIMITATIONS ANO RtMAINING QUCSTIONS


Further study is required to understand the following:

• Safety and efficacy beyond 2 months and in groups
not included in this trial (e.g,. children, pregnant
women, and nnmunLKximpromi»ed persons).

• Whether the vaccine protects against asymptomatic
infection and transmission to unvaccinatcd persons,

• How to deal with those who miss the second
vaccine do%e.

Vaccine dhcacy of 95% (95% credible interval. 90 3 -97.6%)

CONCLUSIONS

Two doses of an m RN A-based vaccine were safe over
a median of two months and pres ided 95% protection
against symptomatic Covid-19 in persons 16 years of
age                        or older.

Paragraphs:

Isaac Deutscher: The Ex-Communista€™ s Conscience: a€~The communist of the early drafts was a 
revolutionary before he became, or was expected to become, a puppet. The communist of the later 
drafts hardly got the chance to breathe the genuine air of revolution. Nevertheless, the original 
motives for joining
were similar, if not identical, in almost every case: experience of social injustice or 
degradation; a sense of insecurity bred by slumps and social crises; and the craving for a great 
ideal or purpose, or for a reliable intellectual guide through the shaky labyrinth of modern 
societya€!. Socialism, classless society, the
withering away of the Statea€”all seemed around the cornera€!. Communism seemed a new 
Prometheusa€’’except that he would not be pinned to the rock by Zeusa€™ s wratha€!. Our 
ex-communist now bitterly denounces the betrayal of his hopes. This appears to him to have had 
almost no precedent. Yet as he
eloquently describes his early expectations and illusions, we detect a strangely familiar tone. 
Exactly so did the disillusioned Wordsworth and his contemporaries look back upon their first 
youthful enthusiasm for the French revolutionise I

Chad P. Bown & Thomas J. Bollyky: How COVIDd€“19 Vaccine Supply Chains Emerged in the Midst of a 
Pandemic: a€~The fact that major economies heavily subsidized many more vaccine candidates than 
were ultimately deployed was unequivocally correcta€!. Unpredictable real-world problems could (and
did) emerge to affect any given candidate. Some subsidized candidates (e.g., Merck and LAVI) failed 
entirely. Others (e.g., Novavax, Cure Vac, Valneva, and Sanofi/GSK) may yet succeed clinically, but 
they will have taken much longer than Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & 
Johnsona€!. Some
of the at-risk public investments to scale up manufacturing for candidates that regulators 
green-lighted (e.g., Emergent in the United States to produce AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson) 
proved problematic. Some facilities ran into quality control issues; others were slow to expand 
because of learning challenges
or inadequate access to inputsa€!. Pfizer and Moderna may turn out to be the success stories ex 
post. But if those previously untried technologies had not worked, vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, 
AstraZeneca, and even Novavax or Cure Vac might have played an even more important rolea€!. They 
were equivalent
to an insurance policya€!. Vaccine manufacturers complained about a series of input shortages. 
Lipids, bioreactor bags, filtration pumps, filters, and other equipment and raw materials were in 
short supply, potentially slowing the scaling upa€!. Was there enough public investment in 
expanding the capacity of the
companies manufacturing those key inputs?a€! Another policy problem may have been too little global 
public investment in expanding the production capacity of those input suppliers. Although the 
United States, and to a lesser extent CEPI, subsidized upstream equipment and raw material 
providers in addition to
downstream vaccine manufacturers, their efforts were likely insufficienta€!. The policy 
a€cefailuresa€D in these cases would be the lack of international policy coordination^!. New 
vaccine manufacturing supply chains emerged to produce the billions of doses delivered by 
Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna,
AstraZeneca/Oxford,  and Johnson & Johnson. Heavy government involvementa€’’especially considerable 
public investment made at riska€”shaped the evolution of these supply chains and the speed at which 
they were formed. But more information is neededa€”on the inputs that went in and the outputs that 
came
outa€”from     the dozens of production facilities in the supply chains behind those brand namesa€!

Michael Pettis: a€~Rogojf posits a China that has little to do with Chinami. He notes that a 
minimum requirement for the global use of the RMB is that a€oeyou have to have some kind of very 
clear rules of law, which [Chinese leaders] dona€™ t have right now.a€D Hea€™ s righta€!. To be 
more specific, to get
the rest of Asia or the world to hold its excess savings in RMB, China would have to enshrine the 
rights of private property (especially foreign-owned private property) and would have to accept the 
rule of law above the rule of the party. That is why most excess savings are held in countries like 
the US and the UK,
but as Beijing has made clear, placing private property rights beyond government interference and 
forcing the party to submit to the rule of law are not even aspirationsa€! against ChinaaC™ s best 
interestsa€!. Whether one agrees or disagrees, the fact is that China and the Chinese government 
have no plans to move
in that directiona€!. If foreigners ever do decide to holda€! savings in China, by definitiona€! 
China must run persistent capital account surplusesa€! transformaCI from an economy with structural 
demand deficiencies and the highest savings rate in history into one with structural savings 
deficienciesa€!. Rogoff is
really arguinga€! that the minimum requirement for the RMB to play a major international role is 
that the Chinese economy and the Chinese political system become something completely differenta€!. 
The role the US and similar countries like the UK play in absorbing global savings, and their 
obvious reluctance to
allow unemployment to rise, requires that monetary and fiscal authorities respond to That means the 
role the US and similar countries like the UK play in absorbing global savings, and their obvious 
reluctance to allow unemployment to rise, requires that monetary and fiscal authorities respond to 
capital inflows by

1/13 I think, like with many other foreign observers, Rogoff posits a China that has little to do 
with China itself and is more a premise against which to discuss the US. For example he notes that 
a minimum requirement for the global use of the RMB...

On economics, why does the right stick with creatures like Kudlow and Moore? Precisely because they
