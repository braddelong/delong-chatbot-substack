CONDITION: Glory to Ukraine:

Alex Kliment @SaoSasha

went and translated that zelensky selfie video from the streets of kyiv, just to know what he was 
actually saying in response to the russian reports that he had fled — so here it is for the rest of 
you, plus this music naturally felt right, enjoy.

Edward Luce @EdwardGLuce

In 2017 I wrote The Retreat of Western Liberalism. Putin's invasion of Ukraine is ultimate test of 
whether democracy is capable of taking tough decisions, or whether our monied elites are too 
invested in global kleptocracy for our systems to hit back. We'll find out soon enough.

Also explains today's emergency assurance session with the oligarchs... it doesn't seem like they 
were prepared for the degree of hurt currently being inflicted. 16/

Anton Troianovski @antontroian

Another extraordinary televised Kremlin meeting, this one with oligarchs. The head of the 
industrialists' lobby group tells Putin to avoid wrecking the Russian economy further in responding 
to Western sanctions; Putin responds describing today's invasion as a "necessary measure."

Subject: Is This Right?

Tom Nichols: a€™Russian troops are probably not very happy about fighting against Ukrainians, but 
they will be more than happy to fight against Americans and their allies if we wade into this. 
Sending NATO into Ukraine could be the greatest gift we would ever give Putin. It would rally 
Russia, prove him right, and lead to a nuclear crisis. This is horrifying and tragic, but this is 
no time to go ape and plunge into world war. I am increasingly
convinced that D J. Rothkopf is right that this could be the end of the Putin regime, but not 
overnight. The Russians have become embroiled in a war against their brothers and sisters; making 
this a war with NATO would be a deadly mistakea€!

Tom Nichols @RadioFreeTom

A lot of brave keyboard warriors out there tonight. NATO exists to defend NATO. Russian troops are 
probably not very happy about fighting against Ukrainians, but they will be more than happy to 
fight against Americans and their allies if we wade into this. /I

Is this right?

It would certainly reassure us that handwringing, and attempting to find some way to very cheaply 
impose costs on oligarchs, is the right thing to do. But does the road to freedom and independence 
for Ukraine run through changing the hearts and minds of the inhabitants of Muscovy, and convincing 
them that they should be ashamed of attempting to impose a complaisant dictator on Ukraine? This is 
far outside my wheelhouse, and I am conscious of how truly pathetic this
from the New York Times is:
