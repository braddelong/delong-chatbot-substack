<p>Something that rarely happens happened this morning. The&nbsp;<em>Atlantic’s</em>&nbsp;Conor Friedersdorf showed up in my inbox. </p><p>As I am cranky, I will tell you exactly what I think: It reminded me that I think that you have limited bandwidth to read things, that you have a duty to your brain to curate what you read, and healthy curating requires that you exclude Conor Friedersdorf and his ilk from your reading list.</p><p>This conclusion is part of a discussion I have been having with myself about how to maintain clarity of thought in an age of unlimited misinformation. </p><p>So what does this imply for your own internet hygiene? You should read people in order to observe the world, and also read people who interpret the world. Of those who interpret the world, these consideration tell you to read those who are (1) knowledgable, (2) smart, (3) engaging, and (4) benevolent—in the sense of wishing people well, and using their intelligence and knowledge to guide people to a better understanding of the world and to make better decisions. I am coming to the conclusion that, while you only need two out of (1), (2), and (3), you definitely need (4). If they don’t have (4), you should mute or ban them—for they are using their intelligence and knowledge to make a cognitive attack on your brain. A good marker of someone using their intelligence and knowledge to make a cognitive attack on your brain is the argument that <em>we should not do the right thing today because it would set a precedent </em>of some sort. An argument that it is not, in fact, the right thing in this case is almost always a legitimate one. The argument that even though it is the right thing in this case it might set a precedent is rarely legitimate. How is it bad to set a precedent that you should do the right thing? That argument can be coherent and legitimate, but it is a very heavy lift.</p><p>And, since I always think better with a concrete case: consider Conor Friedersdorf of the <em>Atlantic</em> (writing for which, I parenthetically note, is a black mark against you (although not a dispositive one), as it means that you had the approval of a late editor who thought it was just fine and dandy to hire someone who had explicitly called for women who had abortions to be hanged). Reading Friedersdorf is not a way of observing the world. His specialty is interpreting the world. He fails (4) above. The conclusion: there are better people on the internet to read than Conor; for your brain’s sake, read them instead of him:</p><p>For quite a long time now I have thought that Conor Friedersdorf’s thought was of this very low quality. What pushed me over the edge, I think I remember, was his attempt, a decade ago, to persuade the liberal audience of the&nbsp;<em>Atlantic</em>&nbsp;that they should not vote in the presidential election. Why? Because the most important thing was stopping the U.S. security services from torturing people, and Obama was not enough better than Romney—even though at that moment Romney and his team were boasting that if they won the presidency the American security services would resume waterboarding people. Friedersdorf’s “argument” then:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>How do you get worse than… the extrajudicial assassination of American citizens?… Obama did that too. Would Romney? I honestly don’t know. I can imagine he’d kill more Americans without trial and in secret, or that he wouldn’t kill any. I can imagine that he’d kill more innocent Pakistani kids or fewer. His rhetoric suggests he would be worse…</p></blockquote><p>Now comes, once again, Conor Friedersdorf:&nbsp;<strong>Conor Friedersdorf</strong>: ’A thought exercise for&nbsp;<em>this is an easy question</em>&nbsp;folks on the left: if Peter Thiel were CEO of Twitter or Facebook, would you still think&nbsp;<em>removing a politician who acts very badly has no at least concerning implications beyond the case in question</em>? Of course not.</p><p>The best single response:&nbsp;<strong>Matthew Yglesias</strong>: ’Like I try to write good articles. But if a different, bad writer, had access to my email list he might send them bad articles instead. I don’t think that’s a reason for me not to write—it’s a reason for me to try to do a good job rather than a bad one…</p><p></p><p>Plus:&nbsp;<strong>Steve M.</strong>:&nbsp;<em>There’s Nothing Like This on Our Side &lt;</em><a href="https://nomoremister.blogspot.com/2021/01/theres-nothing-like-this-on-our-side.html">https://nomoremister.blogspot.com/2021/01/theres-nothing-like-this-on-our-side.html</a>&gt;: ‘I resent the question…. If a right-winger or libertarian banned a left-leaning politician, even a liberal president, from a platform, the only relevant question would be whether the punishment fit the crime…. Peter Thiel… bann[ing] Joe Biden or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for ideology, that would be very different from Twitter banning Trump for… undermining democracy with a series of massive lies, then giving aid and comfort to a violent, seditious mob…. Trump’s Twitter feed has been Rwandan radio for some time now, and he has a large following eager to burn the government down. Until there’s something comparable on our side, Friedersdorf’s question is moot…</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Tom Snyder</strong>: <em>The American Abyss &lt;</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/magazine/trump-coup.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/magazine/trump-coup.html</a>&gt; : ‘When we give up on truth, we concede power to those with the wealth and charisma to create spectacle in its place. Without agreement about some basic facts, citizens cannot form the civil society that would allow them to defend themselves. If we lose the institutions that produce facts that are pertinent to us, then we tend to wallow in attractive abstractions and fictions. Truth defends itself particularly poorly when there is not very much of it around.... Social media... supercharges the mental habits by which we seek emotional stimulation and comfort, which means losing the distinction between what feels true and what actually is true…</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Haley Bird Wilt</strong>: <em>The Consequences of Lying to People &lt;</em><a href="https://uphill.thedispatch.com/p/the-consequences-of-lying-to-people">https://uphill.thedispatch.com/p/the-consequences-of-lying-to-people</a>&gt;: ‘Republican lawmakers misled millions of people into believing the results of a legitimate election could be overturned. Many of them viewed contesting the outcome as a relatively easy way to gain political currency among Trump supporters, knowing all the while that their efforts would have no real impact on who will be sworn into office in two weeks. The deception—primarily led by Trump, yet enabled by members of Congress—set the stage for the violence that unfolded at the Capitol Wednesday. Four people died.... The normally dry procedural affair of counting of the Electoral College votes was viewed by everyday Republicans and zealots alike as the place to make a final stand to overturn the election—even though elected Republicans knew the outcome would ultimately remain unchanged.&nbsp;As my colleague Jonah writes this morning, “Convincing people they need to prevent a coup when no such coup exists is a recipe for violence.” This was the energy that fueled the horde on Wednesday…</p><div><hr></div><h1>PLUS:</h1><h2>Must-Read:</h2><p></p><h2>Should-Read:</h2><h4><strong>DeLongTODAY: <a href="http://delongtoday.com">Why Storm the Capitol Building &amp; Then Do Nothing But Take Selfies?</a></strong>2021-01-08</h4><h4><strong>Project Syndicate: <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-capitol-maga-insurgency-by-j-bradford-delong-2021-01">What Next for the MAGA Insurrection?</a> 2021-01-08&nbsp;</strong></h4><div><hr></div><h2>BRIEFLY NOTED:</h2><p></p><p></p>
