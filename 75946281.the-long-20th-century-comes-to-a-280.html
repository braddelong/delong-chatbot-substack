But these generation-long episodes of economic El Dorados were not sustained….</p><p>[In 1914] World War I came…. </p><p>The global north was lucky enough to rediscover after World War II what it thought was the path to utopia. The pace of economic growth during the Thirty Glorious Years that followed made, by its end in the 1970s, people dizzy with success: expecting more and tremendously upset at what seem in retrospect to be relatively minor speed bumps and roadblocks. But mere rapid growth did not satisfy those of a right-wing temperament, who felt that a prosperity that was shared too equally was unfair and degrading. And mere rapid growth did not satisfy those of a left-wing temperament, either, for they felt that the problems that the market, even tweaked and managed by social democrats, solved did not produce even a partial version of the utopia they sought. And so the world took its neoliberal turn. But the neoliberal policy prescriptions did not produce a slouching toward utopia that was more rapid in any sense…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/the-long-20th-century-comes-to-a-280?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/the-long-20th-century-comes-to-a-280?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>And two nice reviews: one at the <em>Independent.ie</em> and the other at <em>Open Letters Review</em>:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://openlettersreview.com/posts/slouching-towards-utopia-by-j-bradford-delong">Steve Donoghue</a></strong>: ‘Historical asides are so winningly conversational that they very much help to make the book’s 600 pages surprisingly easy reading… [DeLong] has written the most entertaining End Times narrative since <em>The Late Great Planet Earth</em>…’</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/book-reviews/slouching-towards-utopia-clinton-gurus-sweeping-story-of-an-economic-dream-that-died-42026815.html">David Chance</a></strong>: ‘At 600-plus pages… not for the faint-hearted, but there’s little in the way of jargon… the booked is laced with interesting anecdotes, although DeLong does get a bit wordy…’</p></li></ul><p>“A bit wordy.” Hah!
