One of my big takeaways from this war and the 2nd Karabakh War is how important small unit 
leadership and competency is in modern warfare. Dispersion, initiative, and decentralized execution 
are critical, and we have better NCOs, which is a significant advantage. https://t.co/BdkRqzfFVl

Paragraphs

Back just after World War I, when the U.S. had double-digit inflation, Milton Friedman and Anna J. 
Schwartz judged that the Federal Reserve had moved too far (although too late) when it hiked its 
discount rate from 3.75% up to 7%a€”that a smaller, earlier rate hike would have been much, much 
better. The underlying logic behind their position is very close to what Paul Krugman is saying 
here, and I think that is sound:

Paul Krugman: d€™ Real interest ratesa€\ we need to be especially cautious in interpreting thema€!. 
Inflation expectations are very front-loadeda€!. And real interest rates are low mainly because of 
short-run inflation expectationsa€!. We can observe more or less 1 and 2 year real rates as well as 
the usual 5 and 10a€!. What both market breakevens and consumer expectations say is that people 
expect high inflation for the next year
plus, but receding to something not much above previous normal after that. So how should we think 
about real interest rates given that?a€! Which maturity of rates to look ata€! clearly longish: 
interest rates mainly matter for long-lived investments, soa€! the 10-year rate rather than Fed 
funds that mattersa€!. But even 10-year real rate is very low; does this give a strong incentive to 
engage in real investment? You need to think about the
actual process of real investment^!. Imagine developers considering borrowing money to build new 
structures on speca€!. They get to invest not at todaya€™ s prices, but at prices some months, 
maybe >1 year outa€!. The inflation rate that we should be using to estimate real borrowing costs 
isna€™ t the inflation rate starting today. Ita€™ s the inflation rate starting some time in the 
futurea€!. That makes a big difference when
inflation expectations are, as I said, extremely front-loadeda€!

A very smart oldie-but-goodie. a€ceAlienationa€D in the Marxist sense is not merely a market 
phenomenon, but is rather characteristic of any very large-scale human division of labor, no matter 
how mediated:

Cosma Shalizi: In Soviet Union, Optimization Problem Solves You: a€~Marxa€™ s nightmare vision is 
right: capitalism, the market system, whatever you want to call it, is a product of humanity, but 
each and every one of us confronts it as an autonomous and deeply alien force. Its ends, to the 
limited and debatable extent that it can even be understood as having them, are simply inhuman. The 
ideology of the market tell us that we face
not something inhuman but superhuman, tells us to embrace our inner zombie cyborg and loose 
ourselves in the dance. One doesna€™ t know whether to laugh or cry or running screaming. But, and 
this is I think something Marx did not sufficiently appreciate, human beings confront all the 
structures which emerge from our massed interactions in this way. A bureaucracya€! a thoroughly 
democratic politya€! can be just as much of a
cold monstera€!. We have no choice but to live among these alien powers which we create, and to try 
to direct them to human endsa€!

I am not sure this is right: I do not think Lenin could have enforced a mass Russification policy 
throughout the USSR had he wanted to. Matt greatly overestimates, I think, the strength and control 
of the early USSR, and greatly underestimates the strength of nationalism as it had developed in 
the 1800s. Stalin, of course, is a different bowl of borscht:

Matthew Yglesias: Taking Putina€™s Ideas Seriously (& I Guess Literally, too): a€~Lenina€! thought 
he was leading a worldwide communist revolution in which the Russian Soviet Federal Republic and 
Ukrainian Soviet Federal Republic would soon be joined by Hungarian and Polish and German and 
French SFRs. SFRs everywhere, SFRs for everyone. So rather than promoting Russification through 
early Bolshevik mass education,
Lenin instituted a policy he called Korenizatsiya (nativization)a€!. Some of this involved making 
up new written standard forms for languages that never had them. But Ukrainian did have a literary 
standard and a corpus of works, and the Bolsheviks supported it robustlya€!. The timing of 
korenizatsiya intersected in an important way with the timing of industrialization and urbanization 
in Ukraine. At a critical period, instead of using
mass education to Russify Ukrainian-speaking peasants, it was used to Ukrainianize Russophone 
city-dwellersa€!. Stalin rolled back parts of korenizatsiya in the 1930s and promoted strong 
Russificationa€!. Khrushcheva€! shifted Crimea from Russia into Ukrainea€! a favor to the Ukrainian 
branch of the party (an important part of his power base), not a concession to Ukrainian national 
identity. On the contrary, the idea that you could
just transfer a bunch of Russophone communities into a Ukrainian jurisdiction with no follow-up 
effort to Ukrainize them underscores the extent to which the postwar Soviet Union just continued 
the Tsarist policy of not taking Ukrainian national identity seriouslya€!. The point of all this is 
that while Putina€™ s insistence that Ukrainian isna€™ t a real national identity is very strange 
when viewed from the outside, ita€™ s not
particularly eccentric. Lots of very psychologically normal people believe weird stuffa€!. There 
really is something unhinged about looking at people who say theya€™re Ukrainians and saying 
a€oeno, sorry, youa€™re actually Russians ,a€D All the historical and linguistic analyses in the 
world cana€™t argue people out of the position that they have a distinct national and ethnic 
identity. None of these things are a€cereala€D
anywaya€!

It is just crazy how much our sources from the ancient world are a combination of bureaucratic 
chicken-scratchings, complaints that senators dona€™ t get enough respect these days, and the 
equivalent of the National Enquirer. These are not even the wildest excerpts from Procopiusa€™ s 
Secret History'.

Procopius: The Secret History of the Court of Justinian'. a€~She often went to a supper at which 
each one paid his share, with ten or more young men, in the full vigour of their age and practised 
in debauchery, and would pass the whole night with all of them. When they were all exhausted, she 
would go to their servants, thirty in number, it may be, and fornicate with each one of them; and 
yet not even so did she quench her lust. Once
she went to the house of some great man, and while the guests were drinking pulled up her clothes 
on the edge of the couch and did not blush to exhibit her wantonness without reserve. Though she 
received the male in three orifices she nevertheless complained of Nature for not having made the 
passage of her breasts wider, that she might contrive a new form of coition in that part of her 
person alsoa€!

Procopius: The Secret History of the Court of Justinian'. a€~Often, even on the stage, she stripped 
before the eyes of all the people, and stood naked in their midst, wearing only a girdle about her 
private parts and groin; not because she had any modesty about showing that also to the people, but 
because no one was allowed to go on the stage without a girdle about those parts. In this attitude 
she would throw herself down on the floor, and
lie on her back. Slaves, whose duty it was, would then pour grains of barley upon her girdle, which 
trained geese would then pick up with their beaks one by one and eat. She did not blush or rise up, 
but appeared to glory in this performance; for she was not only without shame, but especially fond 
of encouraging others to be shameless, and often would strip naked in the midst of the actors, and 
swing herself backwards and forwards,
explaining to those who had already enjoyed her and those who had not, the peculiar excellences of 
that exercise. She proceeded to such extremities of abuse as to make her face become what most 
womena€™ s private parts are: wherefore her lovers became known at once by their unnatural tastes, 
and any respectable man who met her in the public streets turned away, and made haste to avoid her, 
lest his clothes should be soiled by
contact  with such an abandoned creature, for she was a bird of ill-omen, especially for those who 
saw her early in the day. As for her fellow-actresses, she always abused them most savagely, for 
she was exceedingly jealousa€!

Subject: The USSR in Historical Perspective

More from the current draft of my four-times-longer-than-it-can-possibly-be a€ceBehind the Iron 
Curtaina€D forthcoming lecture:

6.1.6. The Terrors of Stalin

6.1.6.1. Stalin Chose the Party & the Party Chose Stalin: Lenin had named Stalin general secretary 
after the Civil War. It was seen, by both Lenin and his inner circle, as a boring job, a simple 
job, a job for someone with a good work ethic who was committed to the party but otherwise without 
great gifts. Stalina€™ s control of personnel was a more powerful weapon than Lenin or any of the 
others had realized.
Among Lenina€™ s failings was that his late-in-life scribbled warnings were insufficient. In the 
end, Lenin failed to use his prestige to anoint a successor. He refused to set up mechanisms by 
which the will of the people, or even of the industrial proletariat, could be ascertained. He 
failed to attend to this a€oedetail,a€n which would indeed prove to be of a€oedecisive 
importance.a€D

So the party would choose Lenina€™ s successor. And who was the party? The party was people. And 
who had chosen the people? Stalin. Recruitment drives brought the party membership up to 1 million. 
It was the general secretarya€”Stalina€”who appointed local committee secretaries. Local 
secretaries appointed those who screened incoming members, and who chose the delegates to the 
Communist Party congressesa€”who would then do as their
patrona€™ s patron suggested.

And their patrona€™ s patron was Stalin.

After Lenina€™ s death and a three-year interregnum, the party fell into line and accepted Joseph 
Stalin in the drivera€™ s seat in 1927.

6.I.6.2. Was a Different Path Possible?: There might have been another path. It was not 
foreordained that the Soviet Union would turn into a terror-ridden prison camp. But Lenina€™ s 
refusal to plan for succession or create mechanisms for any form of normal politics within the 
Communist Party meant that Russia was likely to fall back into an old political pattern. It meant 
that Soviet Russia was likely to acquire a czar. And in a time of turmoil and troubles, a
czar was likely to behave like the Rurik dynastya€™ s Dread Ivan IVa€”in modern English, aCcethe 
TerribleaCD misses the mark. The czar they got was the Dread Joseph Stalin, born loseb 
Dzhugashvili: a paranoid psychopath, and one of the leading candidates for the greatest 
mass-murderer in human history.

6.1.63. Stalin Rising: Stalin had turned to revolutionary politics after being expelled from an 
Orthodox seminary. He was exiled to Siberia four times. All four times he escaped, and returned to 
Georgia. To some this seemed suspicious. How did he escape so easily? And why was he not afterwards 
afraid to return to his old stomping grounds? Trotsky and others would later come to claim that 
Stalin had spenthis time before World War I asan agent provocateur

who spied on the communists for the Okhrana, the czara€™ s secret political police.

No matter. In 1912 Lenin needed somebody to stir up agitation at the fringes of the empire, and he 
chose Stalin. Stalin was the first major Bolshevik to return to what was then the capitala€”St. 
Petersburg or Petrograda€”after the fall of the czar in 1917. Lenin gave Stalin the post of editor 
of the party newspaper, Pravda. During the Civil War he was responsible for trying to cement the 
revolution among the same ethnicminorities he had agitated earlier that
decade. As party general secretary, Stalin determined who would be in the party, which meant who 
and what would be the party. After World War II East German playwright Bertolt Brecht observed that 
the ideal of his really-existing socialist masters would be if they could a€oedissolve the people, 
and elect anothera€D. As far as the party membership was concerned, their ideal was Stalina€™ s 
reality.

It is no surprise then that Stalin came out on top, though he acquired many enemies in the process. 
Nor is it surprising that a paranoid personality like Stalin with many enemies, including powerful 
ones, took the next steps he did.

Dzerzhinsky died of a heart attack in 1926, before Stalin had consolidated power. Stalin shot all 
the others whom Lenin had mentioned in his testament, save for Leon Trotsky and perhaps Sergo 
Ordzhonikidze. Trotsky was exiled. He was then killed by Soviet secret police in Mexico City in 
1940a€”with an icepick. Perhaps Ordzhonikidze managed to shoot himself before the secret police 
could. We do not know. But, in short, Stalin silenced, and then executed,
all of his former peers. And he promoted to the second rank of power people who were utterly 
dependent on him, and who serveda€”and kept their livesa€”at his whim.

6.1.6.4. The Holodomor: Stalin claimed that the scissors crisis had been caused by a few bad 
apples: the kulaks, rich peasants who he thought were holding back their grain in order to extort 
unfairly high prices. The kulaks, he said, were the problem.
No kulaks, no problem.

The government determined that it would have to do something about these peasantsa€”the ones they 
believed were producing a surplus of agricultural products and yet were unwilling to deliver it up 
to the party. The solution? Coni-Oscate their land and animals and force them onto collective farms 
along with other peasants. Tighten down their standard of living, though, so it would be a little 
bit worse than the others. The other peasants would be happy, the
party thought: only the kulaks would be upseta€”and their resistance could be handled. Thereafter, 
the entire agricultural surplus could be taken to the cities, with no need to supply the 
countryside with any consumer goods at all.

The government was wrong.

Some 94 percent of the Soviet Uniona€™ s twenty-five million peasant households were gathered into 
state and collective farms, averaging some fifty peasants per farm. Many peasants were shot; others 
died of famine. During the 1930s, millions were exiled to Siberian prison labor camps. Perhaps 
fifteen million died. Agricultural production dropped by a third. The number of farm animals in the 
Soviet Union dropped by half.

Were there any benefits to the policy? Not likely. Food for the cities could have been 
obtaineda€”more food on better termsa€”by devoting a share of urban industrial production to 
consumer goods that farmers would find useful and buy. Serfdom is not a very efficient way of 
squeezing food out of the countrysidea€’’especially if the peasants see the serfdom coming and 
slaughter their animals and eat them before the government bureaucrats arrive to take them.
It would have been far more efficient to have kept millions of people who were killed alive (was it 
two million? five? fifteen?) and engaged them in trading their agricultural goods for consumer 
products.


6.1.63. Forced Industrialization: That there was a better way to have obtained results doesna€™ t 
mean the Bolsheviks didna€™t obtain results. During the First and Second Five-Year Plans, Soviet 
statisticians claimed that industrial production^’’which had stood 11 percent above its 1913 level 
in 1928a€”was some 181 percent higher by 1933, and some 558 percent higher by 1938. Heavy industry 
had the highest priority: coal, steel, chemicals, and
electricity. Consumer goods were to come later, if at all.

The plans consisted of a series of selected objectivesa€’’finish this dam, build so many blast 
furnaces, open so many coal minesa€”to be achieved whatever the cost. The aim was to build up heavy 
metallurgy. The task was to acquirea€”by buying from abroad or making at homea€”the technology that 
American heavy industry deployed. In this spirit, a a€oesteel citya€D was to be built in the Urals, 
at Magnitogorsk, and supplied with coal from the Chinese
border. Without Magnitogorsk, it is hard to see how Stalin could have won World War II, for the 
factories of western Russia were under German occupation from July 1941 until late 1943. Similarly, 
dams, automobile factories, and tractor (or tank) factories were all built far to the east of 
Moscow. That there were far fewer people east of Moscow was a solvable problem.

How was Stalin to get workers to man the new heavy industrial plantsa€”especially since he 
couldna€™t pay them much? The answer was by drafting the population. Internal passports destroyed 
your freedom of movement. Access to housing and ration books depended on you keeping your job (and 
satisfying your employer). Satisfying your employer also helped safeguard your life. For there was 
always the threat of Siberian exile to a concentration camp or a
bullet in the neck for those whose bosses accused them of a€oesabotage.a€D At the start of the 
industrialization drive, there were show trials of engineers accused of being a€oeplan-wreckers.a€D

Squeezing the rural standard of living further produced a mass exodus: as unhealthy and low paid as 
living in the cities was, for an adult male, being a semi-serf on the collective farm was worse. 
More than twenty-five million people moved to the cities and the factories during the 1930s. And it 
worked, in its way. The Soviet Union would go on to outpace Germany and Britain in war weapons 
production during World War IIa€”and many of the weapons were of
acceptable quality. Acceptable, however, was set to a low bar. The Soviet T-34C tank was designed 
to last for six months and for only twenty-four hours of intensive combat.

The claims of nearly sevenfold growth in industrial production from 1913 to 1940 were significantly 
exaggerated. Perhaps industrial production in 1940 was (measured using standard techniques) 3.5 
times industrial production in 1913. As best as one scholar could estimate, Soviet real national 
product grew at some 4.5 percent per year, on average, from 1928 to 1958, which was impressive. But 
the butchera€™ s bill was immense.

6.1.6.6. Terrors & Great Terrors: Factory workers were shot or exiled to labor camps for failing to 
meet production targets assigned from above. Intellectuals were shot or exiled to labor camps for 
being insufi-Ociently pro-Stalin, or for not keeping up. Being in favor of the policies that Stalin 
had advocated in the previous year, but not in the current year, could also get you killed.

Communist activists, bureaucrats, and secret policemen fared no better. More than i-Ove million 
government off-Ocials and party members were killed or exiled in the Great Purge of the 1930s. It 
is a grim historical irony that the most dangerous place to be in the Soviet Union in the 1930s was 
among the high cadres of the Communist Party. Of the 1,800 delegates to the partya€™ s 17th 
Congress, in 1934, fewer than one in ten went on to become delegates to
the 18th Congress in 1939. The rest were dead, in prison, or in Siberian exile. The most prominent 
generals of the Red Army were shot as well. The Communist Party at the start of World War II was 
more than half made up of those who had been recruited in the late 1930s, and all of them were 
keenly aware that they owed their jobsa€’’and their status in Soviet societya€”to Stalin, Stalina€™ 
s protA©gA©s, and Stalina€™ s protA©gA©sa€™ protA©gA©s.

Because of the poor records kept, we really do not know the full butchera€™ s bill. We know more 
about how many cows and sheep died in the 1930s than about how many of Stalina€™ s opponents, 
imagined enemies, and bystanders were killed. We do know that the Siberian concentration camps were 
filled by the millions, again and again and again. The a€oeGulag Archipelagoa€D grew to encompass 
millions with the deportation of the kulaks during the
collectivization of agriculture. It was filled again by the purges of the late 1930s. It was filled 
yet again by Poles, Lithuanians, Estonians, Latvians, and Moldavians, when the Soviet Union annexed 
those territories on the eve of World War II. Soldiers being disciplined, those critical of 
Stalina€™ s wartime leadership, and members of ethnic groups thought to be pro-German were deported 
during World War II. After the war, perhaps four million Soviet soldiers
who    had been captured by the Germans and survived Hitler were sent to the Gulag. There they 
rotted and died.

The Russian novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote:

Macbetha€™ s self-justifications were feeble.... Iago was a little lamb.  The imagination and the 
spiritual strength of Shakespearea€™ s evildoers stopped short at a dozen corpses. Because they had 
no ideology. Ideologya€’’that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the 
evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social theory which helps to 
make his acts seem good instead of bad in

his own and othersa€™ eyes, so that he wona€™ t hear reproaches and curses but will receive praise 
and honors.  Thanks to ideology, the twentieth century was fated to experience evildoing on a scale 
calculated in the millions. This cannot be denied, nor passed over, nor suppressed.

6.I.6.7. Is a€oeTotalitarianisma€D a Useful Concept?: Are fascists and really-existing socialists 
to be lumped together as a€oetotalitariansa€n? After all, how much light really shines between the 
fascist and the really-existing socialist?

A distressing number of people, starting with Mussolini himself, seem to have transited from one to 
the other directly. That suggests not a left-right political spectrum but rather a horseshoe, or 
even a color wheel. Red and blue are as far apart in terms of visual wavelengths as colors can be. 
Yet if you take magenta paint and adda little bit of cyan you get blue; if you takemagenta and add 
a littlebit of yellow you get red. George Orwell famously asked, a€ceBut
arena€™ t we all socialists?a€D He was in Barcelona, it was 1937, and the Stalinist-backed 
socialists were exterminating the Spanish Marxist faction that he had joined when he arrived in the 
city (the Workersa€™ Party of Marxist Unification). All the while, Francoa€™ s fascists waited 
outside the city.

There were important policy differences. As Hermann Rauschning claimed Hitler had said to him, 
a€oeWhy need we trouble to socialize banks and factories? We socialize human beings!a€D That is to 
say, really-existing socialism focuses first on control over institutions and commodity flows and 
only secondarily on control over what people think,say, and doa€”but we focusfirst on what people 
think, say, and do.How profound a difference was this really?
And while status inequality was important to really-existing socialists, material inequality and 
ruling-class luxury was  embarrassing. By contrast, for fascists, if material inequality and 
ruling-class luxury bothered you, it only demonstrated that you were not really with the program.

But do these constitute a difference in species, or just variation within a species properly called 
a€cetotalitariana€D?

Let us bring in as a reference British socialist historian Eric Hobsbawma€”a card-carrying 
communist from before World War II until 1956, thereafter becoming more moderatea€”who had a couple 
of asides in his histories that strike me as revealing. The first comes in his 1994 book The Age of 
Extremes, a history of what he called the short twentieth century, or the period from the start of 
World War I in 1914 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Hobsbawm,
writing in his old age, still believed that joining a a€oeMoscow-aligned Communist partya€D was, 
for those who desired global revolution, a€oethe only game in towna€Q a€oeLenina€™ s a€~party of a 
new typea€™  gave even small organizations disproportionate effectiveness, because the party could 
command extraordinary devotion and self-sacrifice from its members, more than military discipline 
and cohesiveness, and a total concentration on

carrying out party decisions at all costs,a€D he wrote. a€oeThis impressed even hostile observers 
profoundly.a€D

Is there a haira€™ s breadth of difference between the fascistsa€™ worship of a heroic leader and 
Hobsbawma€™ s belief that unthinking obedience to the dictator in Moscowa€’’whoever he might 
bea€”who had murdered nearly all of his peersa€”was praiseworthy, and profoundly impressive? To 
accept that being a follower meant devotion and self-sacrifice at all costs would absolutely have 
earned Mussolinia€™ s and Hitlera€™ s approval. a€oeThis is a
fascist coupa€D were perhaps the last words of Stalina€™ s peer Bolshevik Gregory Zinoviev, as 
Stalina€™ s henchmen shot him.

6.I.6.8. Utopian Faith is a Helluva Drug: Before the twentieth century, ideologya€”as opposed to 
religiona€”did not kill people by the millions and tens of millions. The stakes were not thought to 
be worth it. Such enthusiasm for mass murder awaited the combination of aristocratic militarism, 
really-existing socialism, and fascism. Thus it was only in the twentieth century that utopian 
aspirations about how the economy should be organized led nations and
global movements to build dystopias to try to bring the utopian future closer. And then they turned 
around and justified the dystopia: compromises must be made, and this is as good as it is going to 
get.

My view is that too much mental and historical energy has been spent parsing differences between 
movements that are justly classified as dystopian, and even totalitarian, in aspiration. Time spent 
on such a task is time wasted, given their commonalitiesa€”if not in formal doctrine, then at least 
in modes of operation. The guards of Auschwitz, Majdanek, Treblinka, Dachau, and the rest were very 
like the guards of the Gulag Archipelago.

Rather, mental and historical energy should be focused on where these movements got their energy. 
Why was the world unable to offer people a society in which they could live good lives? Why was a 
total reconfiguration necessary? Karl Polanyi saw fascism and socialism as reactions against the 
market societya€™ s inability or unwillingness to satisfy peoplea€™ s Polanyian rights. It could 
not guarantee them a comfortable community in which to live because
the use to which land was put had to pass a profitability test. It could not offer them an income 
commensurate with what they deserved because the wage paid to their occupation had to pass a 
profitability test. And it could not offer them stable employment because the financing to support 
whatever value chain they were embedded in also had to pass a profitability test. These failures 
all gave energy to the thought that there needed to be a fundamental
reconfiguration of economy and society that would respect peoplea€™ s Polanyian rights. And the 
hope of millions was that fascism and really-existing socialism would do so.

Instead, both turned out to erase, in brutal and absolute ways, peoplea€™ s rights, and peoplea€™ s 
lives, by the millions. So why were people so gullible? The German socialist Rosa Luxemburg in 1919 
could see the path Lenin was embarked upon and called it a€oea brutalization of public life: 
attempted assassinations, shooting of hostages, etc.a€D The German liberal Max Weber, writing in 
1918, could also foresee what would become of Lenina€™ s
sociological experiment, saying it would end in a€oea laboratory with heaps of human corpses.a€D 
Similarly, the British diplomat Eric Phipps wrote in 1935 that if Britain were to take Hitlera€™ s 
Mein Kampf seriously and literally, a€oewe should logically be bound to adopt the policy of a 
a€~preventivea€™ war.a€D

The unlikelihood of success at even slouching towards a good society of those who took that turn 
ought to have been obvious.

6.1.7. The Soviet Union in World War II

6.1.7.1. Why Did Stalin Initially Ally with Hitler?: Hitler became interested in 
aa€”temporarya€”alliance with Stalin and the Soviet Union.

Over the years, even while pursuing a a€oePopular Fronta€D and a€oecollective securitya€D among 
non-fascist states to counter fascism in the mid-1930s, Stalin had put out feelers to Hitler. 
Hitler was not interested. Hitler became interested in a deal with Stalin only in 1939, when he 
recognized how useful Soviet neutrality would be for his conquest of Poland. Or at least half of 
it, for now. He and Stalin agreed to split Poland down the middle at the Bug
River. Additionally, the Soviet Union got a green light from Germany to annex the three Baltic 
Republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

Stalin had made the mother of all miscalculations. The pact allowed Hitler to fight three one-front 
wars in successiona€”one against Poland, one against Britain and France, and then one against the 
Soviet Union. Only by the skin of its teeth did the Soviet Union survive until the United States 
entered the war. US factories and logistical support kept the Soviet Red Army fed, fueled, wheeled, 
and moving, and the US Army and Air Force made it possible for an
Anglo-American force to reenter the main theaters of the war. Much better for the Soviet Union to 
have fought Germany in 1939 with powerful British and French allies fielding armies on the 
continent than to face Germanya€™ s undivided attention in 1941, 1942, and the first half of 1943.

It is always difficult to understand Stalin, or indeed anything about the Stalin-ruled Soviet 
Union. a€oeA riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma,a€D Churchill called it. It is possible, 
however, to guess at what the thinking inside Moscowa€™ s Kremlin palace-fortress was:

Q: What is Hitler, comrade?

A: Hitler is a tool of the capitalists, comrade.

Q: Why might Hitler wish to wage an aggressive war against the Soviet Union, comrade?

A: To gain cheap access to our raw materials, comrade, so that his big-business capitalist backers 
can earn higher profits.
Q: So what happens if we offer him as many of our raw materials as possible at an incredibly cheap 
price, comrade?

A: Then he will not seek to invade, comrade. He will have no reason to do so.
Q: What will happen then, comrade?

A: What always happens in the highest stage of capitalism, comrade. The big capitalist powers 
become imperialists, and then they fight terrible wars over markets.
Q: Correct. And after the war is over?

A: We will do what we did at the end of World War I, comrade. We move in and expand the socialist 
camp.
Q: Therefore our goal, comrade, is?

A: To appease Hitler by providing him with all the raw materials he wants. And then wait for our 
moment, comrade.


The plans consisted of a series of selected objectivesa€’’finish this dam, build so many blast 
furnaces, open so many coal minesa€”to be achieved whatever the cost. The aim was to build up heavy 
metallurgy. The task was to acquirea€”by buying from abroad or making at homea€”the technology that 
American heavy industry deployed. In this spirit, a a€oesteel citya€D was to be built in the Urals, 
at Magnitogorsk, and supplied with coal from the Chinese
border. Without Magnitogorsk, it is hard to see how Stalin could have won World War II, for the 
factories of western Russia were under German occupation from July 1941 until late 1943. Similarly, 
dams, automobile factories, and tractor (or tank) factories were all built far to the east of 
Moscow. That there were far fewer people east of Moscow was a solvable problem.

How was Stalin to get workers to man the new heavy industrial plantsa€”especially since he 
couldna€™t pay them much? The answer was by drafting the population. Internal passports destroyed 
your freedom of movement. Access to housing and ration books depended on you keeping your job (and 
satisfying your employer). Satisfying your employer also helped safeguard your life. For there was 
always the threat of Siberian exile to a concentration camp or a
bullet in the neck for those whose bosses accused them of a€oesabotage.a€D At the start of the 
industrialization drive, there were show trials of engineers accused of being a€oeplan-wreckers.a€D

Squeezing the rural standard of living further produced a mass exodus: as unhealthy and low paid as 
living in the cities was, for an adult male, being a semi-serf on the collective farm was worse. 
More than twenty-five million people moved to the cities and the factories during the 1930s. And it 
worked, in its way. The Soviet Union would go on to outpace Germany and Britain in war weapons 
production during World War IIa€”and many of the weapons were of
acceptable quality. Acceptable, however, was set to a low bar. The Soviet T-34C tank was designed 
to last for six months and for only twenty-four hours of intensive combat.

The claims of nearly sevenfold growth in industrial production from 1913 to 1940 were significantly 
exaggerated. Perhaps industrial production in 1940 was (measured using standard techniques) 3.5 
times industrial production in 1913. As best as one scholar could estimate, Soviet real national 
product grew at some 4.5 percent per year, on average, from 1928 to 1958, which was impressive. But 
the butchera€™ s bill was immense.

6.I.6.6. Terrors & Great Terrors: Factory workers were shot or exiled to labor camps for failing to 
meet production targets assigned from above. Intellectuals were shot or exiled to labor camps for 
being insufi-Ociently pro-Stalin, or for not keeping up. Being in favor of the policies that Stalin 
had advocated in the previous year, but not in the current year, could also get you killed.

Communist activists, bureaucrats, and secret policemen fared no better. More than i-Ove million 
government off-Ocials and party members were killed or exiled in the Great Purge of the 1930s. It 
is a grim historical irony that the most dangerous place to be in the Soviet Union in the 1930s was 
among the high cadres of the Communist Party. Of the 1,800 delegates to the partya€™ s 17th 
Congress, in 1934, fewer than one in ten went on to become delegates to
the 18th Congress in 1939. The rest were dead, in prison, or in Siberian exile. The most prominent 
generals of the Red Army were shot as well. The Communist Party at the start of World War II was 
more than half made up of those who had been recruited in the late 1930s, and all of them were 
keenly aware that they owed their jobsa€’’and their status in Soviet societya€”to Stalin, Stalina€™ 
s protA©gA©s, and Stalina€™ s protA©gA©sa€™ protA©gA©s.

Because of the poor records kept, we really do not know the full butchera€™ s bill. We know more 
about how many cows and sheep died in the 1930s than about how many of Stalina€™ s opponents, 
imagined enemies, and bystanders were killed. We do know that the Siberian concentration camps were 
filled by the millions, again and again and again. The a€oeGulag Archipelagoa€D grew to encompass 
millions with the deportation of the kulaks during the
collectivization of agriculture. It was filled again by the purges of the late 1930s. It was filled 
yet again by Poles, Lithuanians, Estonians, Latvians, and Moldavians, when the Soviet Union annexed 
those territories on the eve of World War II. Soldiers being disciplined, those critical of 
Stalina€™ s wartime leadership, and members of ethnic groups thought to be pro-German were deported 
during World War II. After the war, perhaps four million Soviet soldiers
who    had been captured by the Germans and survived Hitler were sent to the Gulag. There they 
rotted and died.

The Russian novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote:

Macbetha€™ s self-justifications were feeble.... Iago was a little lamb.... The imagination and the 
spiritual strength of Shakespearea€™ s evildoers stopped short at a dozen corpses. Because they had 
no ideology. Ideologya€’’that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the 
evildoer the necessarysteadfastness and determination.   That is the social theorywhich helps to 
makehis acts seem goodinstead of bad in
his own and othersa€™ eyes, so that he wona€™ t hear reproaches and curses but will receive praise 
and honors.  Thanks to ideology, the twentieth century was fated to experience evildoing on a scale 
calculated in the millions. This cannot be denied, nor passed over, nor suppressed.

6.I.6.7. Is a€oeTotalitarianisma€D a Useful Concept?: Are fascists and really-existing socialists 
to be lumped together as a€oetotalitariansa€n? After all, how much light really shines between the 
fascist and the really-existing socialist?

A distressing number of people, starting with Mussolini himself, seem to have transited from one to 
the other directly. That suggests not a left-right political spectrum but rather a horseshoe, or 
even a color wheel. Red and blue are as far apart in terms of visual wavelengths as colors can be. 
Yet if you take magenta paint and add a little bit of cyan you get blue; if you take magenta and 
add a littlebit of yellow youget red. George Orwell famously asked, a€ceBut
arena€™ t we all socialists?a€D He was in Barcelona, it was 1937, and the Stalinist-backed 
socialists were exterminating the Spanish Marxist faction that he had joined when he arrived in the 
city (the Workersa€™ Party of Marxist Unification). All the while, Francoa€™ s fascists waited 
outside the city.

There were important policy differences. As Hermann Rauschning claimed Hitler had said to him, 
a€oeWhy need we trouble to socialize banks and factories? We socialize human beings!a€D That is to 
say, really-existing socialism focuses first on control over institutions and commodity flows and 
only secondarily on control over what people think, say, and doa€”but we focus first on what people 
think, say, and do. How profound a difference was this really?
And while status inequality was important to really-existing socialists, material inequality and 
ruling-class luxury was  embarrassing. By contrast, for fascists, if material inequality and 
ruling-class luxury bothered you, it only demonstrated that you were not really with the program.

But do these constitute a difference in species, or just variation within a species properly called 
a€cetotalitariana€D?

Perhaps Stalin wrongly anticipated a replay of World War I: trench warfare that would lead to a 
prolonged stalemate on the Franco-German border, during which another generation of young men would 
be slaughtered, another set of bourgeois countries would exhaust themselves, and another group of 
countries would become ripe for a Moscow-led communist revolution. What is certain is that Stalin 
did not recognize the danger of even a temporary alliance with
Hitler.

A: To appease Hitler by providing him with all the raw materials he wants. And then wait for our 
moment, comrade.

Perhaps Stalin wrongly anticipated a replay of World War I: trench warfare that would lead to a 
prolonged stalemate on the Franco-German border, during which another generation of young men would 
be slaughtered, another set of bourgeois countries would exhaust themselves, and another group of 
countries would become ripe for a Moscow-led communist revolution. What is certain is that Stalin 
did not recognize the danger of even a temporary alliance with
Hitler.
