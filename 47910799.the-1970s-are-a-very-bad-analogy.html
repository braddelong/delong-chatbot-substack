And it is a very good book to talk. </p><blockquote><p><strong>Philipp Hildebrand</strong>: <em>The Old Inflation Playbook No Longer Applies</em>: ‘The debate about how “transitory” inflation would end up being missed the point. The root cause of this rise is more important…. Post-pandemic inflation surge is not principally being driven by excessive demand but by limits on supply capacity…. First, there are economy-wide constraints. In the restart of activity after lockdowns it proved harder to bring supply capacity on stream than for demand to restart. Even more important has been a second sort of misfiring: supply capacity was in the wrong place…. We therefore find ourselves in a fundamentally different situation from the one Paul Volcker faced when he became chair of the US Federal Reserve in 1979. Then, the economy was running hot and the aim was to drive inflation that had become embedded out of the system. But this is not a Volcker moment…. When inflation is driven by demand, judicious policy can in principle stabilise both inflation and growth. This is not possible in a world where inflation is the result of supply constraints. Heightened macro volatility becomes inevitable. Central banks have either to accept higher inflation or be prepared literally to destroy demand across the whole economy to ease supply constraints in one part of it…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1e59e952-c5cf-4c8e-983a-560170c87cda">https://www.ft.com/content/1e59e952-c5cf-4c8e-983a-560170c87cda</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Back in the 1970s we knew what the structural-adjustment problem was. The two triplings of oil prices, in 1973 and 1979, meant that everything energy intensive had the relative price structure strongly tilted against it. There was not a great deal of price discovery to be done: simply take the energy intensity of an activity and multiply it by nine, and you get with the new equilibrium real price of it was going to be.</p><p>The problem in that 1970s was that an expectation that wage inflation next year would be about what wage inflation had been this year, perhaps a percentage point per year or so more, also got embedded in the economy. But that embedding came with no countervailing information flow in terms of price discovery about the true real costs of energy intensive activities. We already knew what OPEC had done, and what its consequences were going to be.</p><p>Our problem today is considerably different. We are wheeling the structure of our economy in a number of different directions with remarkable speed. And there is no sufficient statistic for what the new real equilibrium prices are going to be in the same way that black gold delivered in Cushing, Oklahoma was a sufficient statistic back in The Day. Thus we need to see where the bottlenecks are, and those bottlenecks need to move prices in order to incentivize people to correct them. What we do not want to do is squeeze down on economic production in general so that the bottlenecks go away. That would produce low inflation, true. That would also produce low production. And that would keep us from undertaking the von Hayekian price discovery that the economy needs to learn as fast as possible.</p><p>And, with good luck, and with a Federal Reserve able to manage expectations of its own future actions, we can do this with just a one time step-up of the price level, and not get expectations of continual year-after-year wage inflation in bedded in the expectational and contracting structures of the economy.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Audio:</h2><p>PODCAST <strong>The Media Show</strong>: <em>The Editor Planning to Shake Up News</em>: ‘Ben Smith aims to take on CNN, the New York Times and the BBC… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m00139kr">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m00139kr</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><h2>One Picture:</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ec293f8-1a88-422b-ae98-205de8546b5e_1262x890.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ec293f8-1a88-422b-ae98-205de8546b5e_1262x890.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ec293f8-1a88-422b-ae98-205de8546b5e_1262x890.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ec293f8-1a88-422b-ae98-205de8546b5e_1262x890.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ec293f8-1a88-422b-ae98-205de8546b5e_1262x890.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1ec293f8-1a88-422b-ae98-205de8546b5e_1262x890.png" width="1262" height="890" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1ec293f8-1a88-422b-ae98-205de8546b5e_1262x890.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:890,&quot;width&quot;:1262,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:206370,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ec293f8-1a88-422b-ae98-205de8546b5e_1262x890.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ec293f8-1a88-422b-ae98-205de8546b5e_1262x890.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ec293f8-1a88-422b-ae98-205de8546b5e_1262x890.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ec293f8-1a88-422b-ae98-205de8546b5e_1262x890.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>J.

From the adoption of cloud computing to store and process financial data, artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze it, and blockchain to secure it, the future will surely see additional movement in these directions. But it is uncertain whether digital currencies will be part of that future. Plain vanilla cryptocurrency like bitcoin lack the essential attributes of money and are likely to remain no more than niche investment products. Stablecoins have more of the attributes of money but are expensive to operate. Central bank digital currencies are more obviously viable, but they are a solution in search of a problem. It’s thus not clear, argues Barry Eichengreen, professor of economics at U.C. Berkeley, what economic and social problems they can solve that can’t also be solved by suitably regulated private sector entities…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.cmc.edu/athenaeum/digital-currencies-more-passing-fad">https://www.cmc.edu/athenaeum/digital-currencies-more-passing-fad</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Ben Norton</strong>: <em>The Racist Founding Fathers of Libertarianism</em>: ‘Hayek… "I don’t have many strong dislikes.

But I encountered it later, and I have a profound dislike for the typical Indian students at the London School of Economics, which I admit are all one type–Bengali moneylender sons.
