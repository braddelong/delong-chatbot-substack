ChatGPT is a very effective tool for summoning the general consensus of its source material and rearranging it…. It's a fun way to filter information and the collective insight of whatever subsections of humanity online fed into the training data is, when shaped by whatever set of design choices have gone into its training, probably as good as or better than most of us at generating various kinds of text if you care more about form and general vibeness than actual accuracy. And it often is right, because it benefits from an amped-up wisdom of crowds effect…. I remain unconvinced that this is 'autocomplete for everything', or even for many things, but if I ever want a randomised list of things the early 2021 internet really liked I'll know where to

The next question, of course, is what we do about all this. “How to restore the American middle class” will be the subject of a series of posts, I think.

Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway to bring us not just a profile of the founder of FTX and his “small team dedicated to fixing the world”… but, perhaps unwittingly, the year’s most revealing insight into the VC industry. Sequoia Capital not only invested $214mn with “SBF” after its partners were awed by his ability to pitch cryptobabble while playing League of Legends, but published the portrayal of him as a latter day John Pierpont Morgan on its own website. <a href="https://archive.ph/qFJJN#selection-1981.166-1981.232">Archived for posterity</a> after Bankman-Fried’s fall gave Sequoia second thoughts and a gigantic writedown, the profile may yet spawn a new genre of financial fan fiction.

Leave aside the classic both-siding, where the Biden’s administration less than perfect COVID policy is compared to a national anti-vaccination campaign led by mass murderer Ron DeSantis et. al. for the sake of “balance.” The really infuriating part is blaming this carnage on partisan politics. Hundreds of thousands of easily preventable COVID deaths in the USA over the last two years were caused and continue to be caused by THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. Not by “partisan politics,” which have existed for the nation’s entire history, unlike one of the nation’s two major parties being opposed to vaccination, which is something that just happened for the first time two years ago...</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 50% off a group subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48"><span>Get 50% off a group subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donate Subscriptions&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true"><span>Donate Subscriptions</span></a></p><div class="install-substack-app-embed"><img class="install-substack-app-embed-img" src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png"><div class="install-substack-app-embed-text"><div class="install-substack-app-header">Read Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality in the Substack app</div><div class="install-substack-app-text">Available for iOS and Android</div></div><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_context=author-post-insert" target="_blank" class="install-substack-app-embed-link"><button class="install-substack-app-embed-btn button primary">Get the app</button></a></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://substack.com/refer/braddelong?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_context=post&amp;utm_content=undefined&amp;utm_campaign=writer_referral_button&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Start a Substack&quot;}"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Start writing today.
