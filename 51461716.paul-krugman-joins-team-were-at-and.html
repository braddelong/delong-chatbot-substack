Until recently, it was fairly common for monetary doves to argue that we weren’t really at full employment…. That’s now a hard case to make; the U.S. economy now looks overheated…. which means that it needs to be cooled off a bit…. If we want to revive U.S. economic vitality, we really should try to re-establish our nation’s historic role as a destination for ambitious immigrants. But that’s not a policy idea likely to get much traction, given the American right’s anti-immigrant hysteria. Anyway, you should know that all of those stories about how Americans are no longer willing to work seem to have evaporated. The Great Resignation now looks like a Great Misunderstanding…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/dl20220406a">http://tinyurl.com/dl20220406a</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>This seems broadly right to me. The last six months have made a substantial difference, and so it is time for the Fed to move. But how fast and how far?</p><p>The Fed should be data-dependent, and it should remain very conscious of the asymmetries of the situation: without a sea-change in the willingness of the Republicans to work for the American people rather than Fox News on fiscal policy, there is no way to recover from too much monetary tightening too early, but there are lots of ways to recover from waiting until the case is crystal-clear. The Federal Reserve can cool off the economy easily—at least the housing, export, and import competing sectors. </p><p><strong>Oscar Jorda &amp; </strong><em><strong>al</strong></em><strong>.</strong>—whose estimates of the effect of 2021 fiscal stimulus in the context of monetary ease are somewhat larger than what I had expected—make this point well:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Òscar Jordà &amp; </strong><em><strong>al.</strong></em>: <em>Why Is U.S. Inflation Higher than in Other Countries?</em>: ‘U.S. inflation… compare it with… Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom… [conclude] U.S. income transfers may have contributed to an increase in inflation of about 3 percentage points by the fourth quarter of 2021…. However, without these spending measures, the economy might have tipped into outright deflation and slower economic growth, the consequences of which would have been harder to manage…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2022/march/why-is-us-inflation-higher-than-in-other-countries/">https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2022/march/why-is-us-inflation-higher-than-in-other-countries/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/paul-krugman-joins-team-were-at-and?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/paul-krugman-joins-team-were-at-and?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Max Roser</strong>: <em>Development, Data Visualisation, &amp;

Unemployment is relatively low, many people still have quite a bit of money to spend, and the recovery, in a lot of ways, looks pretty solid. But again, therein lies part of the problem: People have money to spend, but not so many places to spend it…. Brad DeLong, an economist at UC Berkeley, has a modestly more relaxed view on inflation. “My answer is calm down, it’s by and large a desirable part of adjustments. We look out at what people are expecting in the future, and in five to 10 years from now, people are expecting inflation to quiet down. The Fed will do its job,” he said…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22994731/inflation-rate-russia-gas-prices-jerome-powell">https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22994731/inflation-rate-russia-gas-prices-jerome-powell</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p><em><strong>Sigh</strong></em>.

The magazine’s incoherence derives in part from failures of quality control…. Alex Gutentag explains that COVID-era public-health restrictions were never about containing the spread of a fatal virus, but were “actually part of a broader scheme to undermine the middle and working classes, normalize ‘papers, please’ societies, and end the fiat currency system as we know it.” What follows is an eclectic set of conspiratorial ravings that make only peripheral contact with reality, and none at all with obvious objections…. Other pieces betray a similar tendency to start with a conclusion (generally, that some strand of liberal orthodoxy is in fact a fig leaf concealing a betrayal of the common people) and then stick by it, irrespective of evidence. Sohrab Ahmari…. Edwin Aponte…. Nina Power…. Adam Lehrer…. <em>Compact</em> is even ambivalent about its own animating populism. While it routinely derides liberalism as elitist, the magazine’s authors intermittently characterize the majority of Americans as sheeple, hoodwinked by liberal propaganda about Ukraine’s victimhood or the efficacy of COVID vaccines…. All this dissonance might be a virtue in a purely literary project. In a magazine that hopes to prosecute the case against liberalism… gesture toward an alternative dispensation… it is fatal. In the end, <em>Compact</em> adds up to a strong argument for the very thing it aims to indict…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/03/compact-magazine-makes-a-strong-case-for-liberalism.html">https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/03/compact-magazine-makes-a-strong-case-for-liberalism.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>The tactical dance of professional modern warfare. if you could be seen, or if your location could be inferred and pinpointed within a sliding-scale amount that depended on opponents’ firepower, you were dead.  The response has to be: cover and concealment. Movement? Only in very short bursts, when the enemy firepower can be temporarily suppressed. Stay still? That does not work either. For when, your firepower is traced back to your position and pinpointed, then you are dead as well, unless you have moved beforehand. Attackers creeping forward in small mutually-supporting combined-arms on the ground, and defenders dancing backward, abandoning each position just before attacking artillery registers on it. And in the air above are the eggshells-armed-with-hammers that must rely on their own speed and on the suppression of enemy fire to stay alive themselves. How do you build and train a force to do this?:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Noel Williams</strong>: <em>Insights for Marine (&amp; Beyond) Force Design from the Russo-Ukrainian War</em>: ‘The Russo-Ukrainian War provides compelling evidence… that Marine Corps Force Design 2030 is on track…. The Ukrainian military has shown that small, widely distributed infantry formations equipped with precision-guided munitions can operate effectively against armor and mechanized forces without air superiority, or even a traditional air force…. Drones provide important alternatives to manned tactical aviation…. “Loitering munitions will impact the character of warfare more substantially than the introduction of the machine gun.” If Ukraine had enough loitering munitions such as the Hero 120 or Switchblade 600, the now infamous Russian convoy north of Kyiv may have been turned into a highway of death…. Ukrainian forces equipped with shoulder-fired anti-armor weapons, loitering munitions, and armed drones demonstrate the increasing vulnerability of armor and mechanized vehicles…. To have any chance for success, armored or mechanized employment on the future battlefield will require exceptionally well-trained crews and the latest active protection systems (especially top-down protection)…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://warontherocks.com/2022/03/insights-for-marine-and-beyond-force-design-from-the-russo-ukrainian-war/">https://warontherocks.com/2022/03/insights-for-marine-and-beyond-force-design-from-the-russo-ukrainian-war/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>The cruelty is the point: enduring cross-régime patterns of Muscovite state governance. The massacres in Ukraine going on are horrible, but the principal victim of the Muscovite state and its patterns of governance has always been the people ruled from Moscow themselves:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tom Fallows</strong>: <em>Bucha, Katyn, &amp; Srebrenica</em>: ‘In such a short time (the war began only in late February), Putin’s Russia has come a long way to returning to Soviet standards. Putin has already set up an internal regime of totalitarian legal and police-based control of the population, with full restrictions on the media and total propaganda by state-owned media outlets which monopolize news information for most of the Russian population. And now we have another example of a repeat of the USSR story: mass criminal executions done by Russian soldiers against their enemy…. The Katyn massacre was… enormous… over 20 thousand…. But if we add the number of other Ukrainian civilian victims of Russian violence (witness the devastation of Mariupol), we start to come close to the magnitude of the Katyn atrocities. So perhaps the numbers are not so different. But what is different about Bucha is that the execution of these Ukrainians serves no interest whatsoever for grander political/strategic considerations. Stalin at least had a rationale to order the execution of future Polish leadership who could threaten the USSR after the war. But what in the world is the benefit for Vladimir Putin to kill all these civilians in towns under control of Russian soldiers?…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:51583854,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://fallows.substack.com/p/guest-post-another-katyn-massacre&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:403884,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Breaking the News&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d13bc915-b912-45ea-99cc-ea4e03b65417_1280x1280.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Guest Post: Another Katyn Massacre, Another Srebrenica&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Last month I put up two posts about Ukraine and Russia by my brother, Tom Fallows, a life-long scholar of Russian affairs.

Contrary to what David MacIver says, it is useful—at least in some of the circles I travel in. And it is parable about learning that, quite possibly, has a wider range of applicability than you usually think:</p><blockquote><p><strong>David MacIver</strong>: <em>Ubj gb ernq EBG13</em>: ‘So what have we learned? Well we’ve learned to read ROT13 of course. Which there was no good reason to do. But hopefully we’ve also learned a few other useful things. The first is that the key to learning to do something fluently is often to first learn it in a way that can never achieve fluency. You can’t do mathematics fluently if you have to rederive everything from first principles each time, but being able to rederive everything from first principles gives you the scaffolding on which you can build fluency because you know that what you’re looking for will be there, even if it might be slow to access, so you can come to trust in it, and rapidly build up to the point where you remember it. We learned ROT13 not by brute force memorising the letters, but by learning to understand how the cipher worked and how they fit together, allowing us to work out the conversion from first principles. Another interesting thing about the experience of learning ROT13 is how fast it goes. ROT13 text very rapidly comes, if not perfectly transparent at least easily decipherable. It’s easy to think of skill acquisition as being hard, and it usually is, but it’s worth remembering that there are many small skills that you can pick up in a day or so…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:50874300,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/reading-rot13&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:45148,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Overthinking Everything&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/70878ab3-aac9-4330-902b-20c9e9fee4eb_600x600.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Ubj gb ernq EBG13 (How to read ROT13)&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Hi everyone, Today I’d like to teach you an interesting skill: How to read (and maybe write) ROT13!
