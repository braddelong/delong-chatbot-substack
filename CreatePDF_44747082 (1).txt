FIRST AFRICANS
IN VIRGINIA

The first documented Africans in Virginia arrived
here tn Aug. 1619 on the White Lion, an English
privateer  based  in  the  Netherlands.  Colonial
officials  traded  food  for  these  “20  and  odd“

Key Insights:

1. Nearly all successful political movements over the past 150 years have been strongly 
nationalistic

2. A successful cosmopolitanism must therefore be a nationalistic cosmopolitanism^’’one that says 
your country is great because it learns from and has important things to teach other nations.

3. Wea€”somewhat surprisinglya€’’find ourselves endorsing and agreeing with Matthew Desmonda€™ s 
claim that an important root of some facets of American capitalism is found on the plantation.

4. We endorse Sandy Darity and Darrick Hamiltona€™ s calls for reparations,

5. We enthusiastically and positively give a shout-out to the highly patriotic Nikole Hannah Jones 
and her contention that the 1619 founding makes African-Americans the most quintessential 
representatives of the good side of American nationalism

6. You cannot be a real patriot if you do not care about dealing with your countrya€™ s 
flawsa€”Carl Shurz: a€oeMy country, right or wrong; if right, to be kept right; and if wrong, to be 
set right !a€C

7. Wokeness is 21st century Puritan Protestantisma€”to build a City Upon a Hill and become a Light 
Unto the Nations, with a key part of that building composed of our confession that we are the 
unworthy who must place our hearts on the altar of and tremble before the Almighty .

8. It is important to mean it: to repent, to take responsibility, to not just say that America owes 
reparations, but to work to make America pay what it owes.

9. This podcast appears to be our version of: Three strongly patriotic white guys stand up for 
a€~Murka!

10. Hexapodia!
