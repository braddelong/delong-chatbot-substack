With commentary. The passage begins:</p><blockquote><p>[Myy story] naturally starts in 1870.</p></blockquote><p>A short reminder to readers of the start date.</p><blockquote><p>I believe it naturally stops in 2010.</p></blockquote><p>A short sentence to remind readers of the end date.</p><blockquote><p>As the genius Dr. Jekyll-like Austro-English-Chicagoan moral philosopher Friedrich August von Hayek observed, the market economy massively and successfully crowdsources—incentivizes and coordinates at thegrassroots—solutions to the problems it sets…</p></blockquote><p>Introducing two supporting characters: the market economy with its extraordinary power to grassroots-crowdsource powerful solutions to the problems it is set, and its principal 20th century theoretician, the good genius Dr. Jekyll-side of Prof. Dr. Friedrich August von Hayek.</p><blockquote><p>Back before 1870 humanity, given its population, did not have the technologies or the organizations to allow a market economy to pose the problem of how to make humanity rich.</p></blockquote><p>However, back before 1870 humanity did not have the technologies—either the technologies of manipulating nature or the technologies of organizing humans—in either the level amount or the rate of growth for the market economy to be set the problem of moving humanity out of the realm of necessity in which it was trapped, the realm of dire Malthusian poverty.</p><blockquote><p>So even though humanity had had market economies, or at least market sectors within its economies, for thousands of years before 1870, all that markets could do was to find customers for producers of luxuries and conveniences, and make the lives of the rich luxurious and of the middle class convenient and comfortable.</p></blockquote><p>Hence before 1870 market sectors, and market economies, had merely turned their crowd-sourcing energies to making luxurious for the rich and conveniences to make the (small) middle-class comfortable. (Remember! The “middle class” is not the median 50th percentile! The “middle class” are, in previous centuries, those who are not rich but who do not fear starvation should the Wheel of Fortune take even a minor adverse turn!)</p><blockquote><p>Things changed starting around 1870.</p></blockquote><p>Another short sentence for the sake of rhetoric, attempting to hammer into readers the idea that 1870 and its triple—the coming of globalization, of the industrial research lab, and the modern corporation—in a strong and powerful sense marked the end of all previous human history.</p><blockquote><p>Then [in 1870] we got the institutions for organization and research and the technologies—we got full globalization, the industrial research laboratory, and the modern corporation.</p></blockquote><p>The coming of all three of these more or less at once was a truly mighty change. It rationalized and routinized the discovery and development and the development and deployment and not just the local but the global deployment of technological advances. The coming of all these three more than quadrupled the pace at which humanity’s technological empire was increasing. And that step-up in the growth rate lasted from 1870 to 2010.</p><p>Were those three changes baked in the cake by what had come before? Are they best thought of as slow, evolutionary advances that one would naturally have expected to follow from the course of the Industrial Revolution up to 1870? Alfred D. Chandler says: probably not. His "Scale and Scope" makes powerful arguments that the creativity that produced the modern corporation, and the industrial research labs that served it, were results of the particular historical situation and of accidents that happened in the U.S. after the Civil War, After all, no similar developments took place in France or Britain.</p><p>I tend to see industry-oriented universal banks as a key intermediary: those emerged in the U.S. and in Germany, so it was not a unique event. But they did not emerge elsewhere. So it was a rare event. This, however, carries me far away from my main thread.</p><blockquote><p>These were the keys.</p></blockquote><p>Again: a very short sentence to rhetorically hammer home the point that this 1870 triple of the industrial research lab, the modern corporation, and full (not just fledgling) globalization was really really important.</p><blockquote><p>These unlocked the gate that had previously kept humanity in dire poverty.</p></blockquote><p>Another short sentence, driving home the point. Without this triple of industrial research lab, modern corporation, and full globalization, we might well have been doomed. We might well have been doomed by slow productivity growth, by our fecundity, and by the patriarchy that made becoming the mother of at least one son who survived to adulthood nearly the.only source of significant social power for female members of <em>homo sapiens sapiens</em>—to Malthusian or near-Malthusian poverty.</p><blockquote><p>These unlocked the gate that had previously kept humanity in dire poverty…</p></blockquote><p>Without this triple, we had been doomed—by slow productivity growth, by our fecundity, and by the patriarchy that made becoming the mother of at least one son who survived to adulthood nearly the only source of significant social power for female members of <em>homo sapiens sapiens</em>—to Malthusian or near-Malthusian poverty. With this triple, and with the more-than-quadrupling of the pace of proportional growth of humanity's deployed technological prowess that it drove, we had the possibility of escape, into a realm where we could for the first time build a truly human world.</p><blockquote><p>The problem of making humanity rich could now be posed to the market economy, because it now had a solution.</p></blockquote><p>The extraordinary more-than-quadrupling of the pace of human .technological progress deployed into the world economy allowed the market to turn its energies to doing more than making the lives of the rich luxurious and providing conveniences for the middle class.</p><blockquote><p>On the other side of the gate, the trail to utopia came into view.</p></blockquote><p>It was Malthusian poverty that had kept humanity from building its utopia or utopias before 1870. But with the coming of the rapid 2% per year technological progress of modern economic growth, that blockage to sprinting or running or marching humanity to utopia was removed. With the deployed technological prowess in manipulating nature and organizing humans doubling every 35 years starting in 1870, humanity's problem was merely to decide, deliberately, consensually, and thoughtfully, which utopia or utopias we should build for our descendants, right? right?</p><blockquote><p>And everything else good should have followed from that.</p></blockquote><p>And yet it did not. We did not race or jog or even walk toward utopia. At best, we slouched. Sometimes.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/my-grand-narrative-in-slouching-towards?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/my-grand-narrative-in-slouching-towards?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Vaccine Makers Project</strong>: <em>How COVID–19 mRNA Vaccines Work</em> &lt;<a href="https://vimeo.com/579667076">https://vimeo.com/579667076</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/my-grand-narrative-in-slouching-towards?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/my-grand-narrative-in-slouching-towards?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Image: Castle Bran</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff125973f-a8c1-4c19-8dc8-190c8a5191ce_1538x1052.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff125973f-a8c1-4c19-8dc8-190c8a5191ce_1538x1052.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff125973f-a8c1-4c19-8dc8-190c8a5191ce_1538x1052.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff125973f-a8c1-4c19-8dc8-190c8a5191ce_1538x1052.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff125973f-a8c1-4c19-8dc8-190c8a5191ce_1538x1052.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f125973f-a8c1-4c19-8dc8-190c8a5191ce_1538x1052.png" width="1456" height="996" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f125973f-a8c1-4c19-8dc8-190c8a5191ce_1538x1052.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:996,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1990414,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff125973f-a8c1-4c19-8dc8-190c8a5191ce_1538x1052.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff125973f-a8c1-4c19-8dc8-190c8a5191ce_1538x1052.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff125973f-a8c1-4c19-8dc8-190c8a5191ce_1538x1052.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff125973f-a8c1-4c19-8dc8-190c8a5191ce_1538x1052.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Richard J.

The virtual world remains a very imperfect substitute for face-to-face…. Videoconferencing narrows people’s cognitive focus, which hampers idea generation. But today’s digital technologies are sufficiently good for researchers to be able to compensate for the drawbacks, making use of complementary skills and resources around the world….

Evans</strong> (2013): <em>Marx in His Time</em>: ‘<em>Karl Marx:&nbsp;A Nineteenth-Century Life</em> by Jonathan Sperber…. The problem for Marx was that his anti-Prussian campaign required the co-operation of left-wing liberals and democrats, while his championing of the class struggle meant turning against them. While Marx vacillated, the workers lost interest in the former campaign and the democrats were alienated by the latter. The Prussian government recovered its nerve…. The early 1850s… proved a low point for Marx politically, as the Communist League… members in Cologne were arrested and subjected to a mass show trial…. The exiles meanwhile accused each other of hypocrisy and embezzlement, taking each other to court and resorting to fisticuffs…. Scurrilous rumours [were] spread by German and Austrian police spies, who swarmed around them like flies…. Marx withdrew from politics and devoted himself to forging a new career as a journalist, writing articles for the <em>New York Tribune</em>, commissioned by an American working on the paper who had met him in Cologne. He published 487 articles in all, about a quarter of them ghostwritten by Engels when Marx was ill. They amounted to more, in sheer volume, than the sum total of everything else Marx published in his lifetime…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v35/n10/richard-j.-evans/marx-v.-the-rest">https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v35/n10/richard-j.-evans/marx-v.-the-rest</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>The old nationalisms were both particularistic and universal: Britain’s was that of the Mother of Parliaments, which example all others should follow; France was civilization and culture, which all others should follow; Italy’s was the heritage of Rome, which all others should revere; Germany’s was… well, there was a claim to philosophical eminence, and then a claim of engineering eminence, but now it is one of humanitarian remembrance of atrocity; and so on. America’s? It was as the world’s pioneer, exploring utopian possibilities, so that “men shall say of succeeding plantations, ‘the Lord make it like that of New England’.” It is true that this claim to a nationalism that is both particularistic and universal is a very high tightrope to walk. But what was new about Sam Francis was his explicit rejection of it in the name of ethno-nationalist fascism. And why? All because he did not want African-Americans believing they were in any way his equal:</p><blockquote><p><strong>John Ganz</strong>: <em>A Marxism for the Master Class</em>: ‘In his 1992 essay <em>Nationalism, Old and New</em>, [Sam Francis]… rejects the “old nationalism” of Hamilton and Lincoln and proposes a “new nationalism” that will replace its individualism and egalitarianism with something else…. “The social ethic of an authentic nationalism that can summon and harness the genius of a people certain of its identity and its destiny. The myth of the managerial regime that America is… a philosophical proposition… must be replaced by a new myth of the nation as a historically and culturally unique order that… excludes those who do not or cannot assimilate to its norms and interests. This is the real meaning of ‘America First’.”… Here Francis is speaking the language of the “concrete nationalism” of Maurras and Barrés that emerged in Europe towards the end of the 19th century, which differed from the “old nationalism” of <em>liberté, égalité, fraternité</em>. As the French Historian Michel Winock writes, this nationalism would “subordinate everything to the exclusive interests of the nation, that is, the nation-state: to its force, its power, and its greatness” and was of a much more dour tone than the old patriotism…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:58351094,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://johnganz.substack.com/p/a-marxism-for-the-master-class&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:112019,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Unpopular Front&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e2ad597-1a1e-4c5b-be30-d37b49502770_1224x1224.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Marxism for the Master Class &quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;In the New York Times last week, one of the young rising stars of the conservative movement, Nate Hochman, was given the opportunity to articulate what he takes to be the direction and meaning of the American right.
