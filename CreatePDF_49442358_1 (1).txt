European Union: A Talk from 2013


Brad DeLong: European Union: A Talk from 2013\ My problem this morning is that I have four starting 
points. Or maybe my problem is that I have five starting points:

I. A Little Dutch History

My first starting point is the history of the Netherlands.

I would have to be more rash indeed than the fifteenth centurya€™ s Charles de Valois-Burgogne, the 
last sovereign Duke of Burgundy, to dare to opine about classical Dutch history with Jan de Vries 
in the room. But my read of it tells me that a€oepolitical uniona€D is a very vague and sketchy 
concept indeed. Consider the a€oepolitical uniona€D of what was surely the strongest power in 
seventeenth-century Western Europe: the seven United Provinces of the
Netherlands that dominated the economy and were the political-military lynchpin of the coalition to 
contain the aggressive King Louis XIV Bourbon of France.

As I understand it, the Dutch political union then consisted of:

1. A talk-shop in the Hague, with rather less power than currently held by the organs of the 
European Union in Brussels and Strasbourg.

2. The holding of the seven offices of stadthouder of each of the provinces by the then-current 
Prince of Orange, whoever that happened to be.

3. The fact that the single province of Holland had 60% of the GDP of the whole; and thus could 
credibly threaten to go it alone, do what was necessary, make a little list of those who had not 
enthusiastically contributed their share of the resources needed for the common good, and remember.

That was enough of a political union to support a great power in the seventeenth century that could 
dominate the seas and orchestrate the best-funded and most powerful military coalition on land as 
well. Certainly the most memorable piece of bureaucrat and raconteur Samuel Pepys Diary of his life 
in Stuart-Restoration England is his lament, one night as he watched the warfleet he had spent so 
much of his career trying to build burn in the Thames estuary, that
it seemed to him a€oethe Devil shits Dutchmen !a€D

It was enough then. Will that amount of a€oepolitical uniona€D be enough for Europe today? I do not 
know. That is my first pointa€“that a€oepolitical uniona€D is a vague thing, and often you only 
know that you had it after the fact when you look back, and see that things worked, and that in 
fact it did not all fall apart.

H. The Classical Political Theory Tradition (and Janies Madison)

My second starting point is to ask whether a stronger political union than what Europe has nowa€”or 
than the Dutch Republic of the seventeenth centurya€”is even possible.

Here the place to start is with the classical political tradition plus James Madison. Aristotle of 
Stagira believed that there were and could be no stable democracies, and certainly no good 
democracies. They were, he thought to the innermost core of his bones, inevitably ruled by 
factiona€”so much so that the end-state of democratic politics was a downward spiral of 
street-fights and purges ending in tyranny. And while this process worked itself out, he thought, at
those times when you could get enough people assembled in the Assembly to make a decision, the 
policies that resulted would be irrational and random. They would decide today that they should 
execute every adult male in the recently-recaptured city of Mitylene because even the demos had 
been unwise enough to follow the lead of the aristoi when they had decided to rebel and affiliate 
with Sparta. They would decide tomorrowa€’’after what must have been
an incredibly intense night of bribery by Mitylenea€™ s ambassadors and well-wishers in 
Athensa€“that their decision of today had been unwise, reversing themselves, and sending a second 
messenger-ship across the Aegean to tell the occupying fleet not to do what the previous daya€™ s 
messenger-ship had commanded them to do.

Moreover, a democracy would be a bad neighbor. It would be always prepared for aggressive war, for 
war would bring the demos paid employment in the fleet and their share of plunder as well. Since 
those who were prosperous and had something to lose did not have a big voice in the government, the 
government would not pay proper attention to the destructive side of war.
Faction-ridden, irrational, aggressive, militaristica€“the classical Athenian democracy, Aristotle 
said, and for good reason, was very bad news for its neighbors and for itself.

Abetter alternative government, Aristotle thought, would contain an element of 
a€cemonarchya€Da€”top-down direction of an elite competition for winning zero-sum status in serving 
the government and the peoplea€”an element in which the ruling principle of politics was 
a€cehonora€D, as Montesquieu would put it 2000 years later. A better alternative government, 
Aristotle thought, would even be one of despotisma€’’under despotism the ruling principle
would be fear, but at least order would be maintained, and life and prosperity could proceed for 
all except the few who got crosswise of the despot. Perhaps the best regime would be a a€ cere 
public a€da€”a government where, again in Montesquieua€™ s words, the ruling principle would be a 
positive-sum contest for displaying a€cevirtuea€D in serving the republic. But such needed to be 
smalla€”the virtuous cycle of public spirit and public-spirited action
could only be maintained in a small community where the behavior of all could be seen. Thus a small 
city-state with a not-very-democratic mixed-constitution virtue-oriented regime could approximate 
the Just City, for a while, if you were lucky, if you had a good initial lawgiver, but only as long 
as the extent of territory did not grow too great.

And if territory did grow too great? Then the good republic was unsustainable, and you would 
oscillate between monarchy and despotisma€”as Aristotle must have reflected many times during his 
life first as tutor to and then as subject of Alexander III Argeios of Macedon, called a€oethe 
GreataCD.

Thus the classical tradition says that something like todaya€™ s a€oeEuropea€da€”a 
highly-democratic republic on a continent-wide scalea€’’cannot be a possible good regime. To this 
James Madison, writing in The Federalist, says: a€oeNot so! Look at the institutions of the 
second-century BC Aetolian League.a€d (I have not found any other references in secondary works 
that might have been read by James Madison: he must have trawled deeply indeed to
come up with this one as a possible model for what he hoped the United States would become.) It is 
true that democratic politics tends to be faction-ridden. It is true that political decision-making 
tends to be irrationala€’’ruled by transitory passions rather than durable interests. But start 
with a large enough territory, add enough cooling constitutional elements to the orrery of 
government, construct an eighteenth-century Enlightenment mechanical system of
political order with the right properties, and if in its division of power between president, 
senate, and house of representatives it just happens to mimic the division in Great Britain of 
power between king, lords, and commons at the accession of King George III Hanover of Great 
Britaina€”well then, says Madison, it just might work. The constitutional cooling-off elements tame 
the irrationality. The extent of territory makes it more difficult for factions, limited to
one class in one region, to out-organize the rational upholders of good government.

So Madison, trying to correct Aristotle and found the United States, raises at least the 
possibility that a€oeEuropea€n could worka€”with the right constitutional order.

HI. The Necessity of Political Union in the Dark Continent

My third starting point is the absolute necessity of political union in Europe today. It is just 
too costly and too terrible not to have one: the history of the first half of the twentieth century 
and then the edge-of-nuclear-terror decades of the Cold War teach that very strongly.

Was it 111 BC that the Kimbri and the Teutones, having moved down from Jutland to what is now 
Austria and crossed the Danube, decided they would rather cross the Rhine into the land of feta and 
olives in the Rhone Valley rather than eat Sauerkraut and sausagea€“or, back then, probably auroch 
jerkya€“in Noricum, near what is now Salzburg? So they went. And so they looted, burned, ravaged, 
killed, and ruled until a decade later they were broken at the
battles of Aquae Sextiae and Vercellae by the new-model Roman Republican army commanded by Gaius 
Marius C. f. seven times consul. Ever since then, by my count, it is every thirty-seven years that 
a hostile army crosses the Rhine going one way or the other bringing fire and sword. The original 
Swissa€”the Helvetii. Julius Caesar. All of those who claimed to be Julius Caesara€™ s adoptive 
descendants. The Visigoths heading for Andalusia. Louis XIV
commanding his armies to make sure that nothing grows in the Rheinish Palatinate so that his armies 
attacking Holland have a secure right flank. And, last, Remagen bridge in 1945.

Every thirty-seven years, with increasing destructiveness as time passes.

Thirty-seven years after 1945 carries us to 1982. Thirty-seven years after 1982 will carry us to 
2019. By 2019 we will have missed two of our appointments with slaughter. We desperately need 
political union in Europe lest the bad old days from 111 BC to 1945 come again as we once again 
fall victim to the tragedy of great power politics. That means that politicians find some way to 
uniona€”so that differences are thrashed out in conference rooms in Brussels
and Strasbourg rather than in the streets with Molotov cocktails, submachine guns, armed drones, 
and worse. That is the necessity.

IV. Kindlebergian Hegemony?

Thirty-seven years after 1945 carries us to 1982. Thirty-seven years after 1982 will carry us to 
2019. By 2019 we will have missed two of our appointments with slaughter. We desperately need 
political union in Europe lest the bad old days from 111 BC to 1945 come again as we once again 
fall victim to the tragedy of great power politics. That means that politicians find some way to 
uniona€”so that differences are thrashed out in conference rooms in Brussels
and Strasbourg rather than in the streets with Molotov cocktails, submachine guns, armed drones, 
and worse. That is the necessity.

IV. Kindlebergian Hegemony?

The fourth starting point: return to the question of the possibility of a unified Europe. A 
presupposition of the Madisonian hope for a durable and well-functioning democratic government of 
great extent and territory was a certain original cultural not homogeneity but affinity: people in 
Georgia had to look at people in Maine as friends and allies by default, with the growth of faction 
needed to convince them otherwise. Suppose that is lacking. What then?

You then have to jury-rig something. You then have to hope for or to somehow generate a benevolent 
Kindlebergian hegemona€”some actor large enough to be the first-mover, to set the policy, because 
it is our way or the highway. This requires a willingness on the part of the hegemon to 
follow-through on its policy commitmentsa€”to mean it when it says a€ceour way or the high way a€D. 
This also requires a willingness on the part of the hegemon to be
exploited to some degreea€”to let others free-ride on the public goods of international civil, 
political, and economic order that it establishes and provides. The hegemon has to be large and 
powerful enough to have an overarching interest in those international public goods. And it has to 
value public order, or public order plus various exorbitant-privilege benefits of hegemony, more 
than it feels taken advantage of by the free-riding.

Absence of a hegemon is, in brief, Kindlebergera€™ s theory of why the history of the North 
Atlantic economy between 1919 and 1939 was such a tragedy: Britain no longer but the United States 
not yet willing and perhaps not yet able to be the hegemon. That leads one to fear that perhaps, at 
the deepest level, the central problem with Europe today is that the United States is no longer the 
Cold-War North Atlantic benevolent hegemon it once was, but that
Germany has not or has not yet stepped into that benevolent-hegemon rolea€“or because of German 
history and German attitudes would not be tolerated by the rest of Europe in that role.

V. External Pressure?

The fifth and last starting point is what Madison left out: who the Aetolian League actually 
worked. It did work. It was remarkably stable. It had an executive. Its executive had powers and 
made decisions. It could command rather than request from its city-state membersa€”and its commands 
were obeyed. But the Aetolian League was impossible to imagine without Macedon to the north. A 
hostile great power on its borders was essential to induce the surrenders
of sovereignty needed for the Aetolian League to function. Analogously, a hostile Great Britain 
that would not have minded scooping up an ex-colony or two that wished to return to the bosom of 
Westminstera€”and confiscate the fortunes, and perhaps the lives and sacred honora€”of the 
politicians who had led them astray into independence was essential to induce the surrenders of 
sovereignty needed for Madisona€™ s constitution and Madisona€™ s United
States. In the absence of potentially hostile Great Britain, it is very difficult to imagine the 
politicians of Rhode Island agreeing to their voice being all-but-drowned-out in the lower house of 
representatives, and impossible to imagine the politicians of Virginia and Massachusetts agreeing 
to their voice being reduced to no louder than Rhode Islanda€™ s voice in the upper house of the 
senate.

There is a story that when Paul-Henri Spaak was Secretary-General of NATO, he was asked if it would 
not be a good idea to erect statues to the founders of what was then becoming the European 
Uniona€”the ECSC, the EEC, the EC, et cetera. His response, supposedly: a€oeWhat a wonderful idea! 
There should be a fifty-foot tall statue of Josef Stalin in front of the Berlaymont Palace to 
remind us of why we are all here!a€D It was the Red Armya€™ s Group
of Soviet Forces in Germany at the Fulda Gap that concentrated peoplea€™ s minds behind the ideas 
of the Monnets and the Schumanns most powerfully in the decades after World War II. That 
potentially-hostile superpower created a powerful desire on the part of many to make sure the ECSC, 
then the EEC, then the EC, and finally the EU succeeded.

And all of that vanished at the start of the 1990sa€“although there is a chance that we may in a 
few years be thanking Vladimir Putin for bringing it back.
Where do all five of these starts leave us?

VI. The Euro and the Lessons of 1919a€“1939

We ought, when we started the euro, have remembered the principal lessons of 1919a€“1939.

First, there is the lesson that John Maynard Keynes tried unsuccessfully to teach Harry Dexter 
White at Bretton Woods: that in order for an international market economy to be stable and 
prosperous, adjustment to macroeconomic disequilibrium needs to be symmetrically undertaken by both 
surplus and deficit regions, and not by deficit regions alone.

When Christina Romer was in office back in 2010, she would stand up at OECD meetings and say: 
a€oeWhat Europe needs to do in order to solve its financial and structural crises is not just a 
shift to sounder finance and more public austerity in the periphery, but pro-growth policies in the 
core.a€D Everyone would say a€oeyes, yesa€D and applaud. But what Christie would mean by 
a€oepro-growth policies in the corea€D is for a proportional share of the
adjustment burden to be undertaken by surplus regions, which would mean 4%/year inflation in 
Germany and Holland. That would have been required for 2%/year inflation in the Eurozone as a 
whole, and thus for structural adjustment in Southern Europe to take place without grinding wage 
deflation. Deflation in the periphery and only 2%/year inflation in Germany means you wona€™ t hit 
your 2%/year inflation target for the Eurozone as a whole. And you
wona€™t get structural adjustment until generations have passed.

Second, if an international economy is to have any chance of avoiding crises, an integrated banking 
system requires an integrated banking supervisory system. Either you have to cut banking systems 
off from each other and run credits and debits through sovereignsa€“and then backstop those 
sovereigns, as the government of Austria was not backstopped when it tried to support the 
Credit-Anstalt back in 1931a€”or if you let banks hold assetsand liabilities
across national borders the supervision with an eye toward minimizing and then dealing with 
systemic risk needs to cross national borders and be global as well.

Third, for crises to be successfully managed, the lender of last resort must truly be a lender of 
last resort. The first part of the Bagehot rule is lend freelya€”and the lending must be truly 
free, and truly unlimited in quantity. The lender must be able to create whatever asset the market 
thinks is their port-of-safe-refuge and do so in whatever quantities the market thinks it might 
every possibly demand. It cannot get hung upon, say, PierreLavala€™ s desireto win
points for himself in French domestic politics by vetoing Austro-German plans to increase the tax 
base via customs union as a way of making it sustainable for the German Weimar Republica€™ s 
Reichsbank to rescue the OeNB which was trying to rescue the Credit-Anstalt which had tried to 
moderate the Great Depression in the Danube basin by continued lending into the posta€“1929 
downturn.

Fourth, in order for any monetary union or fixed exchange-rate union larger than the size of a true 
optimum currency area to survive, it must be willing to undertake large-scale fiscal transfers to 
compensate for the absence of the prohibited exchange rate movements that would otherwise shift 
terms of trade and rebalance the economy. Monetary union on a scale as large as the Eurozone 
requires large fiscal transfers, which are unthinkable without some operating
and functioning form of political union.

I do know that those of us who were, back at the start of the 1990s, watching the project of the 
establishment of the Eurozone assumed that the establishment was being carried out by people who 
had learned these lessons. They were, after all, obviousa€”or maybe obvious only to people who 
watched international finance, or maybe obvious only to people with Ph.D.a€™ s in economics who had 
written their dissertations in international finance, or maybe
obvious only to those few of us who had made a relatively deep study of 1919a€“1939. We now find 
that the Princes and Princesses of Eurovia today do not appear to have learned these lessons. 
History taught the lessons. It taught them, I thought, fairly convincingly. But were the Princes 
and Princesses of Eurovia listening?

How did this come about? Why didna€™ t Maastricht set up a single Eurovia-wide banking supervisor 
to align financial regulatory policies across the Eurozone? Why didna€™ t Maastricht explicitly set 
up the fiscal transfer funds that, it was clear then, would be needed whenever some regional 
component of Eurovia were to fall into a deep recessiona€”as some regional component surely would 
at some time? Why did Maastricht leave a good deal of lender-of-
last-resort authority in the hands of national governments that could not print moneya€“could not 
create the safe asset for the systema€”and implicitly task them with responsibility for their 
banking system? And why, given that one countrya€™ s exports are another countrya€™ s imports by 
necessitya€’’and given that the United States will not always be enthusiastically the possessor of 
a hyper-strong dollar and the importer of last resort to guarantee full
employment throughout Europea€”does not the adoption of policies in Eurovia deficit regions to 
shrink their imports automatically trigger the adoption of corresponding policies in Eurovia 
surplus regions to boost their imports?

Part of the reason was the general belief in the Berlaymont and elsewhere that requiring the 
specification of what were seen as ancillary details at Maastricht would postpone the project for 
years if not decades. The logic of events, it was thought by many, would inevitably lead to the 
development of the missing pieces: first the common banking regulatory union, then over time the 
fiscal union, and then the political union necessary to make the fiscal union durable
and acceptable, and then the making of the Europeans needed to populate the political union and 
keep it stable against centrifugal tendencies. And as for the fear that surplus countries might be 
reluctant to share in adjustments’’well, back in 1992 it must have seemed extremely unlikely that 
politicians anywhere in Europe would ever have turned down an IMF-blessed demand that they expand 
their economies and reduce their levels of unemployment.

Surely when the crisis came we thoughts”at least those of us who worked in the U.S. Treasury and 
talked to the IMF thoughtS”if it is indeed necessary that some European countries expand in the 
interest of structural adjustment, the IMF blessing of that expansion would neutralize any domestic 
political opposition to Soesound financeSD. Yet we seem today to live in a very different world 
indeed from the world that we thought then that we did.

And, of course, underlying everything at Maastricht and in those Helmut Kohl post-Cold War years 
was a background gestalt that Maastricht was in large part Germany renewing its commitment to the 
continued and further integration of Europe in the aftermath of the very strong support given by 
the rest of continental Europe to the Bundesrepublika€™ s absorption of the German East. If it 
turned out that someone had to pay somehow somewhen for the sin of
not clearly foreseeing the consequences of the single currency and the Eurozone, this political 
support by the rest of continental Europe in the face of some skepticism as to the wisdom of 
immediate German unification from the United States and Russia meant that the rest of Europe had a 
very deep well of credit with Germany on which it could draw. Germany would remember. And Germany 
would be eager to pay.

It may well all work out. Fifty years from now historians may well be writing that Maastricht was a 
gamblea€”and was, like Waterloo, a near-run thinga€”but a gamble that in the end paid off after 
all. a€oeAfter alla€D, historians may say in 2063, a€oeit has now been 108 years since an army 
crossed the Rhine with fire and sword, and the unforeseen costs of Maastricht are a very small 
payment for an insurance policy against that eventualitya€U. There may
still be large differences in prosperity between Europea€™ s core and its periphery. But come 2063 
Europe as a whole may well be so rich that these are and are seen as second-order concerns at most. 
In 2063 Northern Europeans may still grumble that Southern Europeans lack a proper work-ethic, but 
when they do so they may do so as they pay through the nose for the amenities of all of their 
Mediterranean vacations.

After all, being taxed a bit to support the common European project has large benefits. The Kimbri 
and the Teutones never got to enjoy the feta and the olives and the sunshine. We have every reason 
to think that the Northern Europeans of 2063 will.
Perhaps.

Perhaps not.

But right now, it looks to me as though history did indeed teach the lesson, but that while history 
was teaching the lesson the Princes and Princesses of Eurovia today were too busy texting on their 
cell phones to pay any attention.

was a background gestalt that Maastricht was in large part Germany renewing its commitment to the 
continued and further integration of Europe in the aftermath of the very strong support given by 
the rest of continental Europe to the Bundesrepublika€™ s absorption of the German East. If it 
turned out that someone had to pay somehow somewhen for the sin of
not clearly foreseeing the consequences of the single currency and the Eurozone, this political 
support by the rest of continental Europe in the face of some skepticism as to the wisdom of 
immediate German unification from the United States and Russia meant that the rest of Europe had a 
very deep well of credit with Germany on which it could draw. Germany would remember. And Germany 
would be eager to pay.

It may well all work out. Fifty years from now historians may well be writing that Maastricht was a 
gamblea€”and was, like Waterloo, a near-run thinga€”but a gamble that in the end paid off after 
all. a€oeAfter alla€D, historians may say in 2063, a€oeit has now been 108 years since an army 
crossed the Rhine with fire and sword, and the unforeseen costs of Maastricht are a very small 
payment for an insurance policy against that eventualitya€U. There may
still be large differences in prosperity between Europea€™ s core and its periphery. But come 2063 
Europe as a whole may well be so rich that these are and are seen as second-order concerns at most. 
In 2063 Northern Europeans may still grumble that Southern Europeans lack a proper work-ethic, but 
when they do so they may do so as they pay through the nose for the amenities of all of their 
Mediterranean vacations.

After all, being taxed a bit to support the common European project has large benefits. The Kimbri 
and the Teutones never got to enjoy the feta and the olives and the sunshine. We have every reason 
to think that the Northern Europeans of 2063 will.
Perhaps.

Perhaps not.

But right now, it looks to me as though history did indeed teach the lesson, but that while history 
was teaching the lesson the Princes and Princesses of Eurovia today were too busy texting on their 
cell phones to pay any attention.
