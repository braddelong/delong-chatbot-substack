First: Playing the Game of Life Not on Easy Mode:


My sometime student Lisa Cook has her senate hearing for her nomination to the Federal Reserve 
Board of Governors this morning. And there have not been nearly enough positive validators. A fair 
and meritocratic selection process would have thrown up a lot more Black Fed Governors by now. But 
there are complaintsa€”and they, I think, all boil down to a€oeunlike we white guys, she hasna€™ t 
been playing the Game of Life on the a€~easiesta€™ setting

<https 
://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/>, and 
so hasna€™ t piled up as many of the points I care about as I havea€!a€D

Pretty stupid. Pretty much completely in bad faith. And a bunch of people who know, or ought to 
know, how smart and thoughtful Lisa is are not out there validating her nomination. Come on guys!

Speaking as a U.C. Berkeley faculty member, I am offended by even the suggestion that any 
distinguished graduate of our Ph.D. program is not excellently qualified to serve on the Board of 
Governors of the Federal ReserveaCI
& very nice to see Paul Romer here <https://paulromer.net/lisa-cook/>a€!

& Adam Posen:

Craig Torres & Daniel Flatley: Feda€™ s First Black Female Nominee Brings New Focus, Stirs GOP Ire: 
a€~Adam PosenaCI highlights the value of people with different backgrounds on a central banka€™ s 
board, noting that it took somebody like Cook to challenge the notion that property rights alone 
provided sufficient protection to foster innovation. a€oeYou want to have a diversified portfolio 
of people so you have different perspectives and
arena€™t caught short as the world lurches ,a€D he saysa€!

Amanda Terkel quoted me:

Amanda Terkel: Bidena€™ s Federal Reserve Nominee Lisa Cook Is Facing A Racist Smear Campaign: 
a€~Brad DeLong is a professor of economics at Berkeley and has known Cook since the 1990s, a€oewhen 
she was a go-getting graduate student here at Berkeley making things happen.a€D He said he would 
a€oeeasily put her in the top third in terms of most qualifieda€D Fed nominees.

a€oeShe has the distinction of having made me change my mind in a seminar through argument about 
something important: how disastrous the progressive-era attack on the African American talented 
10th was,a€D he told HuffPost. a€oeThat is very unusual, because I am a very arrogant SOB, and even 
when I lose a debate, I almost always attribute the loss to my poor performance rather than to the 
weight of reason.a€D

The Federal Reserve Act gives the president the power to choose the board of governors, adding that 
he or she a€oeshall have due regard to a fair representation of the financial, agricultural, 
industrial, and commercial interests, and geographical divisions of the country.a€da€! a€oeAlmost 
all presidents have completely ignored this charge ,a€D DeLong said. a€oelt is nice to see Biden 
stepping up, even if only in a small way. Where is the unskilled-
labor representing governor? Finance, wealth, technocratic economists and small business [owners] 
are almost the only people who have ever gotten a voicea€Da€!

61f367eee4b02de5f516fa2a>
And I wrote to the Daily Caller:

The five Biden Fed appointments and reappointmentsa€’’Powell as Chair, Brainard as Vice-Chair, 
Bloom Raskin as Vice-Chair for Supervision, Cook and Jefferson to the Boarda€”strike me as a near 
perfect portfolio of central-banker appointments. (The only big improvement I could see would come 
from switching Brainard and Powell, who do make a good team, but I don't see why Lael should always 
be playing second fiddle here.) The Amended Federal Reserve Act
charges the President, in choosing the members of the Board of Governors, to "have due regard to a 
fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and comAmercial interests, and 
geographical divisions of the country..." These are all five extremely high-quality and 
hard-working people with a very strong sense of public service, and together they have the 
comprehensive set of perspectives that the Amended Federal Reserve Act directs the President to 
provide in
his appointmenta€”a comprehensive set of perspectives that has been greatly lacking in the 
appointments of past presidents who have felt free to disregard the legislative language of the 
"representation" clauses of the Amended Federal Reserve Act.

& Paul Romer:

Paul Romer: Theories, Facts, and Lisa Cook: a€~I proposed a theorya€!. In a paper available here or 
here, Lisa presents evidencea€! about a crucial point that this line of reasoning [of mine] missed. 
She used patenting as a proxy for the activities that spur growth and assembled convincing evidence 
that there is another part of the legal system that has a bigger effect: the degree to which it 
creates a climate of personal security by protecting citizens
from the threat of violencea€!. The gist of Lisaa€™ s paper is conveyed in two figures. The first 
presents patenting rates for black inventors and the control group, white inventorsa€!. The second 
shows the timing of violence against Blacks during these years. The surprise for me was the size of 
the effect on black patenting at a time when the control group of white inventors shows no 
comparable change. Had I considered the effect that changes in
personal security can have on an activity like patenting, I might have concluded that it could have 
some effect, but I would not have expected the effect to be so large. After Lisaa€™ s evidence 
forced me to think again about how easy it is to take personal security for granted and about the 
profound effect that a lack of personal security can have on optimism and a willingness to invest 
in the futurea€!. Growth theorists could learn a lot by looking
beyond the degree to which a system of law provides protection for contracts and intellectual 
property rights and evaluating the degree to which it creates a climate of personal securitya€!.

the only shield to his memory is the rectitude and sincerity of his actions. It is very
imprudent to walk through life without this shield, because we are so often mocked by the failure 
of our hopes and the upsetting of our calculations; but with this shield, however the Fates may 
play, we march always in the ranks of honour a€ I
