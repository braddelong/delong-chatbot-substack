First: I Have a Bad Feeling About This:

My 75 person class this semester is divided roughly equally into two parts, group #1 of which has 
seen and (hopefully) at least somewhat remembers macro economic growth theory before (and also has 
had some experience with computer programming), and group #2 of which has not. No I want the class 
to not learn but rather use a bunch of the conclusions of this growth theory. Thus I am taking the 
second week to either review, remind, or give the bottom line
conclusionsa€’’depending on what they bring to the course.

So I want to be reassuring. But I dona€™ t think this draft piece from my lecture notes is really 
going to reassure group #2:

In the Basic Solow Growth Model, the equilibrium economists look for is an equilibrium in which the 
economya€™ s capital-output ratio dUoe.. .1° is contant, and thus the capital stock per worker, the 
level of income and output per worker, and the efficiency of labor are all three growing at exactly 
the same proportional ratea€”a rate that remains constant over time. We will call this rate g, for 
growth.

Is this going by at bewildering speed? Blame it on the fact that our curriculum here in Economics 
is not well-designed. We want you to have the tools of economic theory to use here in this course. 
But we don't have time to build them from scratch. So we skate over the surfacea€’’providing a 
quick review to those of you who have taken Econ 100b before, and a skating-over-the-surface to 
those of you who have not.
Remember: we do not want you to understand the conclusions of these models and theoriesa€”we merely 
want you to know those conclusions, take them for now on faith, and use them.


As my teacher's teacher, the Nobel Prize-winning economic historian Robert Fogel once said, the 
killer app of history (and economics) is counting things.

Math is basically all about counting things. But we are very lucky, in that we stand on the 
shoulders of giants who have figured out how to and transmitted to us the knowledge of how to count 
things in incredibly powerful ways.

One such giant whose shoulders we stand on is Mua₄¥ammad ibn MA«SAO al-KhwAElrizmA« (c. 780-850). 
The first part of his name is simply "Muhammad, son of Moses". The second part? It is the answer to 
the question: "OK. But which Mua₄¥ammad ibn MA«sAd wandering around Baghdad in the early 800s 
during the reign of the Kalif al-Mamun are we talking about?a€d The answer was: "the one who came 
here from KhwAdrizm, and
who works at the House of Wisdom established by the Kalif".

When Italians heard "al-KhwADrizmA«", they mangled it into algorithm. Every time you say algorithm, 
you are saying that you are undertaking the kind of step-by-step analysis that Mua^ammad ibn MA«SAD 
al-KhwADrizmA« taught us to do. Hew as the author of: Al-KitAEJ) al-Mukhtad'£ar fA« HisAEb al-Jabr 
waa€™ l-Mud* 3AJLbalad€”The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing

It was his work on how to repeatedly and rapidly do large numbers of similar and related 
calculations that allowed us to turn simple counting into the mathematics of "what-if?" machines. 
We ask the question "what-if?" And we then answer it be doing a large number of calculations about 
what might be at once, seeing which of these calculations produce ansers that satisfy whatever the 
consistency and coherence conditions we have imposed are, and
then summarizing the results of all of them in a very small space. It becomes complicated and very 
hard to remember and opaque very quickly. But, at the bottom, it is just counting.

Listen to physicist Richard Feynman, about how his QED theory of the interaction of light and 
mattera€”a theory that has been tested and is correct at unbelievably precise scales. As of 1985:

Experiments have Dirac's number at 1.00115965221 (with an uncertainty of about 4 in the last 
digit); the theory puts it at 1.00115965246 (with an uncertainty of about five times as much). To 
give you a feeling for the accuracy of these numbers, it comes out something like this: If you were 
to measure the distance from Los Angeles to New York to this accuracy, it would be exact to the 
thickness of a human hair...

No doubt experiments and calcuations since have sharpened both of those, and they are still in 
agreement.
Feynman, talking about this "Feynman Diagram" theory of his, said:

An analogya€!. The Maya Indians were interested ina€! [when they would be able to see the War-Star] 
Venusa€!. To make calculations, the Maya had invented a system of bars and dots to represent 
numbersa€! and had rules by which to calculate and predict not only the risings and settings of 
Venus, but other celestial phenomenaa€!.
Only a few Maya priests could do such elaborate calculationsa€!.

Suppose we were to ask one of them how to do just one step in the process of predicting when Venus 
will next rise as a morning stara€’’subtracting two numbersa€!.. How would the priest explain?a€!.
He could either teach us thea€! bars and dots and the rulea€! or he could tell us what he was 
really doing:

Suppose we want to subtract 236 from 584. First, count out 584 beans and put them in a pot. Then 
take out 236 beans and put them to one side. Finally, count the beans left in the pot. That number 
is the resulta€!.

You might say, a€~My Quetzalcoatl! What tediuma€! what a job!a€™
To which the priest would reply,

Thata€™ s why we have the rulesa€!. The rules are tricky, but they are a much more efficient way of 
getting the answera€!. We can predict the appearance of Venus by counting beans (which is slow, but 
easy to understand) or by using the tricky rules (which is much faster, but you must spend years in 
school to learn them)...

We stand on the shoulders of myriad upon myriad of armies of giants. All we have to do is to build 
in our brains a filing system so we can remember how to utilize the conclusions of all the work 
they have gifted us with, trusting that they were indeed giants and knew how to do their job.

Hinze Higendoorn: Perception in Real-Time: Predicting the Present, Reconstructing the Past: a€™ We 
feel that we perceive our environment in real-time, despite the constraints imposed by neural 
transmission delays. Due to these constraints, the intuitive view of perception in real-time is 
impossible to implement. I propose a new way of thinking about real-time perception, in which 
perceptual mechanisms represent a timeline, rather than a single timepoint. In this
proposal, predictive mechanisms predict ahead to compensate for neural delays, and work in tandem 
with postdictive mechanisms that revise the timeline as additional sensory information becomes 
available. Building on recent theoretical, computational, psychophysical, and functional 
neuroimaging evidence, this conceptualisation of real-time perception for the first time provides 
an integrated explanation for how we can experience the presents!

Liam Bright: a€™ My somewhat more detailed sense of the present balance of forces in something like 
The Typical Anglo-American University. The largest group, and not only numerically largest but over 
represented in positions of senior authority, are what I would call Generic Libs, left of centre 
but not especially so. Probably basically like Kier Starmer and Elizabeth Warren. They donS™ t 
understand and vaguely fear and resent woke students, who they think of as
something like the mob in a Victor Hugo novel (the TV show The Chair captured this vibe well). One 
way in which IS™ m a culture war centrist is I think the university is simultaneously full of 
insufferable baby-wokes who discovered Politics in 2016 and have been awful ever since, and also 
resentful mediocrities who blame feminism for their inadequacy. We contain multitudes. The next 
next biggest group are the woke. Disproportionately represented among students
and junior faculty youS™ d not naturally think itS™ s gonna be an especially powerful group. But 
they have four things going for them. 1. ThereS™ s often a power base for them in administration, 
as office for diversity (etc) often has more soft power than official position in the hierarchy 
suggests. 2. Some humanities disciplines ensure they will have representation at senior faculty 
level. 3. They have friends in the press so can credibly threaten bad publicity. 4. Most of
all, they have asabiyya. They have the energy and solidarity of young people who believe in what 
theyS™re doing and why. This group feeling lets them achieve more than their often quite junior 
official positions would suggest. Third are resentful anti-wokes. Smaller in number than either 
previous group they usually feel a bit beleaguered. But they have three things going for them. 1. 
To get anything done you have to go via first group. The second group achieved that


through fear. That works ok, but the anti-wokes thereby automatically get some institutional 
sympathy, as no one likes being pushed around and thata€™ s how the generic libs feel when 
confronted by the woke kids. 2. They also have friends in the press, so have a similar credibly 
threat to the second group. 3. They have allies with formal political power, and Deans are very 
aware of the need to fend off right populist attack. There are of course other factions and 
interest

groups, some of which can get a lot done, but Culture War wise these are the significant 
groupingsa€!

Charles Gaba: a€™ Unlike the Delta wave, which saw case and deaths hit the least-vaxxed counties 
with rates up to 4x or 5x as high as the most-vaxxed, Omicron has been the reverse in terms of case 
rates so far. As a result, herea€™ s what things look like since June 30th for each. First, herea€™ 
s what cumulative case rates from 6/30/21 - 1/21/22 look like broken out into 10 equal-population 
2-dose vaccination deciles. As you can see, Omicron has completely
cancelled out the prior trenda€! all 10 brackets have virtually identical case rates now. But 
herea€™ s the kicker: Even with virtually identical infection rates in all 10 brackets, the death 
rate is still 4x higher in the least-vaccinated tenth of the country than the most-vaccinated 
tenth. Ia€™ 11 have more on both trends and where theya€™re likely headed going forward soon. None 
of this actually surprises me, but I did a double take to see the case rate run virtually even 
across
all                                                                                                 
                                                                                                    
                      10 deciles at the same timea€“I figured therea€™ d be more variance even as 
they shift. Two other important caveats to keep in mind: 1. These graphs include Delta and Omicron 
combined; they look very different separately (Ia€™ 11 include Omicron only on a Monday blog post) 
2. The vaxx data is based on 2-DOSE vaccinations; it does not include Booster data yeta€!
