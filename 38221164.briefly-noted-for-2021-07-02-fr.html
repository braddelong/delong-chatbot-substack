Eighty thousand samples sounds like a lot, but it’s nothing in a country like China, which boasts over 7,500 native species of vertebrates. Besides, many of the animals tested in the first wave were pigs, chickens, and cows…. It’s not as if bat coronavirus hunters are coming up empty. New SARS-like bat coronaviruses are being found all the time…. </p><p>“Even if you’re doing the most sophisticated gain-of-function research you could possibly be doing, you have to start with a virus that’s at least close. We would estimate 99 percent, [or] even higher than that, 99.9,” Dr. Robert F. Garry…. There’s no way to use laboratory tricks to overcome this need for a close source virus. Even if researchers were to cut and paste different natural viruses together, each component virus would have to be in the 99 percent similarity range…. [If] the WIV… didn’t have wild viruses almost exactly like Covid–19, it couldn’t have engineered it, period. As far as anybody knows, the closest strain the WIV had is a bat virus called RaTG13 that’s 96 percent similar to Covid–19, but the gulf between 96 percent and &gt;99 percent is vast. The two viruses probably shared a common ancestor between 25 and 65 years ago…. </p><p>If RaTG13 were used as a backbone for Covid–19, Rasmussen told me, you’d expect to see big chunks of exact similarity with coherent chunks of new information added in…. Instead… Covid–19 differs from RaTG13 by over 1,000 point mutations spread through the virus like raisins in a pudding…. If the WIV had a secret strain (or strains) at least 99 percent similar to Covid–19, it got that raw material from the wild. That would mean there’s at least one wild virus that’s at least 99 percent similar to Covid–19 somewhere in nature, where humans had contact with it at least once…. Given that Covid (or its direct ancestor) must exist in nature, it’s more likely that it got out naturally (like SARS and MERS) than that it took an undetectable detour through a secure biolab. </p><p>If Covid–19 were bioengineered, that would mean the WIV lab found the now-untraceable Covid–19 precursor&nbsp;strain(s), and even though its main job is publishing about the cool viruses it finds, it never published it or talked about it, not even to the small army of American and international scientists it collaborates with. Then it embarked on a painstaking process of undetectably tweaking the Secret Ancestor into Covid–19, its manipulation succeeded, and then multiple layers of biosecurity failed, and Covid–19 escaped. It’s not impossible. But it involves a number of exceptions to rules—a number of carefully designed systems failing. Meanwhile, the natural origin theory just involves countless bat roosts with millions of bats doing what they do best: generating new viruses like the world’s most chaotic supercomputer… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162689/bats-covid-19-lab-leak-theory">https://newrepublic.com/article/162689/bats-covid-19-lab-leak-theory</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Add to this the fact that most of those enthusiastically pushing the lab-leak theory have a track record of being bad actors…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-02-fr?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-02-fr?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Hamilton Project</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Policies to Protect Workers and Families: Rethinking Social Insurance</em>: ’pening remarks from former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell, as well as Q&amp;A with former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors Jason Furman….

Our larger, more complex social networks now transfer high-fidelity information over vast distances at low cost. The digital age and the rise of social media have accelerated changes to our social systems, with poorly understood functional consequences. This gap in our knowledge represents a principal challenge to scientific progress, democracy, and actions to address global crises. We argue that the study of collective behavior must rise to a “crisis discipline” just as medicine, conservation, and climate science have, with a focus on providing actionable insight to policymakers and regulators for the stewardship of social systems…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/27/e2025764118">https://www.pnas.org/content/118/27/e2025764118</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-02-fr/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-02-fr/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>(Remember: You can subscribe to this… weblog-like newsletter… here:&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>There’s a free email list.
