Then came a great shift: invention sprinted forward, doubling our technological capabilities each generation, and creatively destroying the economy again and again. Brad DeLong’s <em>Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Twentieth Century</em> &lt;<a href="http://bit.ly/3pP3Krk">bit.ly/3pP3Krk</a>&gt; tells the story of the major economic and technological shifts of the 20th century. </p><p>DeLong charts the unprecedented explosion of material wealth after 1870 which transformed living standards around the world, freeing humanity from centuries of poverty, but paradoxically has left us now with unprecedented inequality, global warming and widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo. Our ancestors believed that by now utopia would have been the inevitable result of such material wellbeing – instead of arriving at utopia we are slouching towards it. </p><p>In this conversation with Bristol Ideas’ Andrew Kelly, DeLong looks at the role of public understanding of the complexity of economics; writing grand narratives and the inspiration of Eric Hobsbawm; and the importance of editors. They discuss economic growth from 1870 in the great transformation; Mill, Keynes, von Hayek and Karl Polanyi; the great period of social democracy and welfare in the ‘Trente Glorieuses’ post-Second World War; the collapse of the New Deal Order and how it might have been saved; the impact of neoliberalism; and the challenges now and what to do next.</p><p class="button-wrapper"

Personally, I’m pretty sanguine about this development. It’s no secret that I think that Twitter is a <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2016/12/is-twitter-dystopian-technology.html">uniquely dystopian feature</a> of the modern media sphere a bad equilibrium that traps the nation’s journalists, politicians, and intellectuals in close quarters with all the nastiest and most strident anonymous bottom-feeders. There’s a nonzero chance Musk will be able to improve this situation; if not, it’s hard to see how he could make it particularly worse. If he destroys the platform, we’ll find something else — probably a number of different somethings, which I think would be good for the media ecosystem…. Twitter’s power of “cancellation” is boosted by another feature of the internet: permanence. Anyone who searches for your name will always be able to find those 200 people who got mad at you on Twitter. This means that “cancel culture” is different than traditional social ostracism, which you could escape by moving to a new town or by people forgetting a controversy over time…</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Matt Yglesias</strong>: <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/one-billion-americans-now-more-than?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">One Billion Americans — now more than ever</a>: ‘We want a story to tell China and the world about a path to enduring American primacy that doesn’t involve keeping everyone else down. We know that China is already facing extremely stiff demographic headwinds. We know that lots of people from around the world would like to move to the United States. And we know that we have the capacity to do more to financially support parents of young children. We should try to address those issues in ways that are sensitive to conservatives’ concerns, but we should in fact try to address them and have more legal immigration and more of a policy tilt against the trend toward ever-fewer children. That doesn’t answer all the dozens of specific diplomatic, economic, military, and political questions posed by U.S.-Chinese rivalry, but it would put us on a fundamentally firmer footing.
