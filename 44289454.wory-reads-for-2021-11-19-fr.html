High-quality early care and education provides critical socialization and learning opportunities when the brain is developing rapidly and is particularly responsive to the outside environment…. Adequate funding is necessary for human capital development. Fully funding the subsidy programs and devoting resources for state-level agencies to assist providers in qualifying for subsidies are two ways in which greater public investment could increase child care availability and quality. Supporting child care workers is crucial for promoting quality care and human capital development. Using public funds to support higher compensation would help stabilize the child care workforce, ensuring that these workers can afford to stay in their jobs. Investing in the nation’s children is one of the safest bets policymakers can make. Research on early care and education programs finds that $1 in spending generates $8.60 in economic activity…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/research-paper/the-child-care-economy/">https://equitablegrowth.org/research-paper/the-child-care-economy/</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>2) Equitable Growth’s Jonathan Fisher did very well before the House Select Committee on Economic Disparity &amp; Fairness in Growth in detailing Equitable Growth’s push for improving the American statistical system to be good at things other than simple national scale means:</p><p></p><p><strong>Jonathan Fisher</strong>: <em>Testimony before the House Select Committee on Economic Disparity &amp; Fairness in Growth</em>: ‘In which direction should the federal statistical system move?….

Congress should support the Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics working together to develop one survey that can: Measure income, consumption, and wealth. Having all three measures in one survey would decrease academic disagreement on the proper survey or definitions to use. Reconcile the reporting of these measures…. Link to administrative records….

Wage bargaining between employers and employees in real time simply does not appear to be a thing. Instead, employers post wages and then overwhelmingly hold the line:</p><p></p><p><strong>Raffaele Saggio &amp; </strong><em><strong>al.</strong></em>: <em>Wage Posting or Wage Bargaining? A Test Using Dual Jobholders</em>: ’This paper examines the behavior of dual jobholders to test a simple model of wage bargaining and wage posting. We estimate the sensitivity of wages and separation rates to wage shocks in a worker’s secondary job to assess the degree of bargaining versus wage posting in the labor market. We interpret the evidence within a model where workers facing hours constraints in their primary job may take a second, flexible-hours job for additional income. When a secondary job offers a sufficiently high wage, a worker either bargains with the primary employer for a wage increase or separates. The model provides a number of predictions that we test using matched employer-employee administrative data from Washington State. In the aggregate, wage bargaining appears to be a limited determinant of wage setting. The estimated wage response to improved outside options, which we interpret as bargaining, is precisely estimated, but qualitatively small. Wage posting appears to be more important than bargaining for wage determination overall, and especially in lower parts of the wage distribution. Observed wage bargaining takes place mainly among workers in the highest wage quartile. For this group, improved outside options translate to higher wages, but not higher separation rates. In contrast, for workers in the lowest wage quartile, wage increases in the secondary job lead to higher separation rates but no significant wage increase in the primary job, consistent with wage posting. We also find evidence in support of the hours-constraint model for dual jobholding. In particular, work hours in the primary job do not respond to wages in the secondary job, but hours and separations in the secondary job are sensitive to wages in the primary job due to income effects…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/wage-posting-or-wage-bargaining-a-test-using-dual-jobholders/">https://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/wage-posting-or-wage-bargaining-a-test-using-dual-jobholders/</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>4) I have long thought that economists should be a lot more like anthropologists than we are.

When I listen to Jason Furman, for example, I hear rhetorical alarm coupled with a suggestion for only a very small revision in the future of monetary policy—that the Federal Reserve’s first interest rate hike should probably be made next February rather than next October, leaving short-term interest rates about half a percentage point per year higher at the end of 2022 than the Federal Reserve is currently penciling in. That is not a huge difference. The inflation we have seen this year—that is just the rubber left on the road from the skidmarks that always happens when you try to rapidly re-join highway traffic at speed. Nothing that has happened so far this year has surprised me, definitely not enough to make me revise my belief that the inflation we see is highly likely be transitory. And I am greatly encouraged by the fact that Wendy Edelberg of the Hamilton Project agrees:</p><p></p><p><strong>Wendy Edelberg</strong>: <em>What Does Current Inflation Tell Us About the Future?</em>: ‘Should [we] expect continued extraordinary inflation for core goods—everything from automobiles to exercise mats—in the coming years? Three factors suggest no. First, the surge in spending on goods has put upward pressure on prices as suppliers have been unable to keep up with demand. Suppliers have strong incentives to iron out issues with the supply chain to get more product onto shelves; in addition, the problems with the supply chain that owe more directly to the pandemic will ebb as the pandemic is brought under control globally. Second, that surge in goods spending is no doubt temporary because households—as the pandemic recedes—will rebalance consumer spending toward services, which has been unusually depressed…. Third, the fiscal support to households that has helped to finance the surge in goods spending has largely waned. In contrast to spending on consumer goods, spending on services remains below its pre-pandemic peak. This pattern is a significant departure from previous business cycles where services were relatively unaffected…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.hamiltonproject.org/blog/what_does_current_inflation_tell_us_about_the_future">https://www.hamiltonproject.org/blog/what_does_current_inflation_tell_us_about_the_future</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>2) I do not understand whether there is some picky technical requirement that prevents the Joint Tax Committee and the Congressional budget office from taking a clear-eyed view of the importance of IRS enforcement. But without taking a clear-eyed view, they do not present a full picture of the budget impact of the Build Back Better act, which looks highly likely to me to be deficit reducing over the long term:</p><p></p><p><strong>Kate Berner</strong>: <em>’CBO estimates that Build Back Better</em> will add $367.1B to the deficit. That doesn’t include revenue collected from tax enforcement. Treasury estimates $479.6 revenue from tax enforcement.

If the central bank is surrounded by people who get panicky every time growth picks up, then a) we are never going to find out what the true productive potential of the economy is, and b) companies will take this into account in their investment plans. To focus on Alan Beattie’s iconic example, if you know that there will always be surplus low-wage labour, but that demand will be periodically restricted, why on earth would you invest in a mechanical car wash? Basically, for most of the post–2001 Great Moderation, we accidentally created an environment tailor made to discourage entrepreneurial investment and encourage rent-accruing behaviour.

I think that they are 100% correct in their strong condemnation of algorithmic feeds tuned to attempt to maximize attention. Internet companies that seek to serve their users require users to make deliberate and considered choices about what they want to put in front of their faces:</p><p></p><p><strong>Chris Best &amp; Hamish McKenzie: </strong><em>The Internet Needs Better Rules, Not Stricter Referees</em>: ‘People are taking the wrong lessons from the Facebook Papers…. The key to a healthier platform is to flip the power dynamic: give the people themselves the power to choose what they pay attention to. Let the will of the people control their feeds, not the other way around. Instead of removing people’s agency by manipulating their attention in favor of the most profitable and provocative content, let them seek out what they really value. Other than in extreme cases involving violence or illicit activity, people should be allowed to decide for themselves who’s worth listening to, what’s trustworthy, and which direction is punching “down.” Beyond being undesirable, relying only on top-down moderation is ineffective: tech companies didn’t invent teen insecurity or tribal resentments, and they won’t fix those problems through censorship whack-a-mole. There is no world in which all vexing views can be banished. And if there were, none of us should want to live in it. There will be no perfect internet, but there can be a better one.

Costa Rica is not a country that has remained poor and nevertheless upgraded its human development patterns. It is a country that has become much richer and has invested well in human development:</p><p></p><p><strong>Martin Ravallion</strong>: <em>The Degrowth Fallacy </em>: ‘In an example of the Degrowth Fallacy, in a radio interview… Jason Hickel (introduced as an economist and anthropologist at the London School of Economics) points to Costa Rica to support his claim that rich countries can maintain their social outcomes at lower mean income. Yes, Costa Rica has had good social and environmental policies over many decades, and other countries can learn from that experience. However, the country did this in combination with economic growth. Indeed, mean income has tripled in real terms since 1960, and the average growth rate has been above average for Latin America (World Bank). By combining social policies with policies that directly supported economic growth, Costa Rica was able to attain over time good social outcomes for a country at its level of mean income.

The key paper here is Paul Krugman’s 1998 paper where he looked at the liquidity trap in Japan…. I believe the paper is underestimated and misunderstood…. I view it as one of the most important macro papers of the last 40 years…. The problem in Krugman’s view was not just that money and bonds are equivalent at zero interest rates. The real problem is sort of bearish expectations of future monetary policy…. One interpretation is that monetary policy still works at zero interest rates. The central bank just needs to commit to future inflation…. The other interpretation… is that central bank promises to inflate are not likely to be credible… so you need Keynesian fiscal policy…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/podcasts/01112021/scott-sumner-princeton-school-macroeconomics-and-overcoming-inflationary">https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/podcasts/01112021/scott-sumner-princeton-school-macroeconomics-and-overcoming-inflationary</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/publish/post/44289454&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/publish/post/44289454"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>
