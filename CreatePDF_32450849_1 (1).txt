This is the DeLongTODAY Briefing. I am Brad DeLong, an economics professor at the University of 
California at Berkeley, and a sometime Deputy Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.
Here I hold forth here on the Leigh Bureaua€™ s vimeo platform on my guesses as to what I think you 
most need to know about what our economy is doing to us right now.

I promised Wes Neff when he agreed to provide the infrastructure for this that I and my briefings 
would be: lively, interesting, curious, thoughtful, and relatively brief.
Relatively.

I promised I would provide briefings on a mix of: forecasting, politics, macroeconomic analysis, 
history, and political economy.
Today is mostly an economic analysis situation briefing: the minimum wage. What should it be, 
technocratically and neoliberally?
But firsta€!

hello, here is some news

Facebook is building a newsletter product, designed to court independent
writers and journalists

As brash as those tweets might seem on first glance, however. 1 swear there was some
thought behind them. I genuinely believe that Twitter and Facebook getting into paid
newsletters is good for writers and a positive development for the media ecosystem. We
need                                               more initiatives that give power to writers and 
reduce the force of the attention
economy. just as we need more electric cars, more solar energy, and less burning of
fossil fuels. The Bolt, after all. is a great car, and it's good for the world that it came
when it did. Just look at what General Motors is promising now: a full transition to
electric transport.

GM isn't acting out of concern for the environment. It has realized that its gasoline cars
aren't as good as their electric counterparts. The internal combustion engine, an
invention                                               as old as the phonograph, is reaching its 
limits. At the same time, battery
technology is improving rapidly and getting cheaper every day. Later this year, all going
to plan. Tesla will release a full-sized sedan that accelerates from zero to 60 miles per
hour in under two seconds and drives for more than 500 miles per charge better
performance than a McLaren with greater range than a Honda Civic. GM can't compete
with that by releasing a next-generation Boh. It has to reinvent its entire business.

Perhaps Twitter and Facebook arc realizing that they may need to take similarly radical
action to be on the right side of history.

One of the reasons we started Substack is that we were concerned about the effects of
the attention economy on the human mind That might sound grandiose, but it is
undeniable that our addiction to social media is having negative effects on both
individual    and collective thought. As individuals, we fret about doomscrolling and
watch                                                    in hopeless horror as we become 
rage-monsters in the digital public square. As a
society, we wonder how it has come to pass that a conspiracy theory-addled mob can
overrun the Capitol. Not all of these things happen because of social media, but it does
play a significant role. We are feeding our minds with a poisoned information supply.

However, we at Substack have neter thought that the solution lies in simply shouting
about how engagement-based business models lead to media products that arc
superficially compelling but underneath are eroding the foundation of society . Instead,

we have set out to show that platforms that put writers and readers in charge are just

Paul Krugman started a a€oeSubStacka€D

So I am going to be starting one too: <http://braddelong.substack .com>
What is a SubStack?

SubStack isa€! classical weblogginga€”but. What is the a€oebuta€D? The a€cebuta€D is:

1. A very aggressive push of the post to the email inbox of the recipient, rather than waiting for 
the recipient to come surfing by, with perhaps an rss-flag tickler to remind readers to come by. A 
subscription email with a website attached, rather than a website with a push RSS feed attached.

2. A very, very aggressive focus on what used to be called the tip jar, which hath now fed upon 
that meat upon which CAisar doth feed and grown great, and morphed into a paywall.

3. A focus on longer-forma€”a newsletter rather than a log of readings and reactions. (That, 
however, may not turn out to be the stable form of whatever medium it turns into: Adrian Hona€™ s 
<http://mssv.net> used to have three columnsa€’’links with a phrase or a sentence, paragraphs, and 
essays.)

SubStack isa€”like Medium <http://medium.com> before ita€”at one level an explicit reaction to the 
consumption and destruction of what appeared to be a growing weblog-based public sphere by 
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and companya€’’each of which consumed part of the space, and each of 
which succeeded in generating superior dopamine-hit random-reinforcement engagement, which turned 
what I at least regarded as a functional and improving
intellectual ecosystem into: the Net of a Million Lies.

I guess the game is to return Facebook to its role of posting updates for family and friends; to 
turn Twitter into SubStacka€™ s comment section, and to, as Hamish writes up top, provide a€oea 
calm space that encourages reflection^ I free of advertising or any other distractiona€l no 
addiction-maximizing feeds, autoplaying videos, or retweetable quote-retweets to suck you into a 
psychological space you never asked to be ina€la€D

Will it work? Probably not. Can it be worse than Zuckerberga€™ s or Dorseya€™ s firehoses of 
fear-generating misinformation? Almost surely not. Thus it is, I think, worth trying. As Noah Smith 
said on the inaugural edition of our Hexapodia podcast 
<https://braddelong.substack.eom/p/hexapodia-is-the-kev-insight-i-relief> 
<https://api.substack.com/feed/podcast/47874.rss>, we have already tried everything else, with less 
persistent success than Sisyphus.

2020-02-11

Let me start with how economists currently understand the minimum wagea€”how the literature on how 
the labor market works started by David Card and Alan Krueger has led people to think about the 
issue.

There is a too-simple view of the labor market. It is that when you hire a worker, you have to pay 
an amount proportional to that workera€™ s quality to attract them away from other possible jobs 
because the market is in equilibrium and effort and skill are rewarded. Offer to pay a wage 50% 
higher, and you attract a pool of workers who cannot get higher-paying jobs. Select the best ones 
out of that pool and you find you have workers who do 50% more work
than you got from the workers you could hire at the old, lower wage that you had been paying. You 
thus have no market power to choose the wage you will pay per unit of work. And so you keep on 
hiring workers until the value to you an extra worker producesa€”his or her marginal revenue 
producta€”is just a bit above the cost per unit of work that the market-in-equilbrium makes you 
pay.

That way of understanding the labor market seems to be wrong.

Instead, when you cut the wage you pay, you find that you do have trouble attracting workers to 
fill all the slots in your table of organization: you would, if you could do it, rather have your 
organization more fully staffed-up because you are leaving money on the table: an extra worker on 
the shift would bring in more extra money than their wages. But when you cut the wage you pay, you 
also save because you are paying your non-marginal workersa€’’those
who feel themselves stuck to the joba€”less as well. What you lose because you are running your 
organization with inefficient staffing holes in your table of organization you make up for by a 
lower wage bill in general. A low-wage policy that gives you an inefficiently-lean organization is 
thus the profit-maximizing one.

Now I find it a mystery why so many low-wage workers appear to be stuck to their jobsa€”why is it 
sufficiently difficult to find another one nearby and as good that employers, even small employers, 
even small employers in densely populated areas, have a€oemarket powera€D in the sense that they 
can choose how much they will pay per unit of, as Marx would say, labor power hired? I do not 
understand well. But it is.

So suppose we have such a labor market, and we take employersa€™ power to choose what they will pay 
their lowest-paid workers away from them: we raise the minimum wage. They then no longer have the 
power to choose to pay less, thus saving wage costs for all their workers stuck to the job. So they 
keep hiring until marginal revenue product equals wage costsa€”you thus get a higher level of wages 
in the low-wage part of the labor market, and also a
higher level of employment. A higher minimum wage thus creates jobs.

Now this part of the labor marketa€”the one in which firms have market power because workers are 
sticky-at-the-job, the one in which as long as the minimum wage is not binding firms can thus 
choose to save on the wage costs of their sticky workers by refusing to pay the prevailing market 
wage needed to fill their table of organization so that the firm runs with optimal efficiencya€”is 
not the whole of the labor market. There are jobs where workers are not
sticky. There are firms that hire up to the point where the wage equals the marginal revenue 
product. And for those firms, a higher minimum wage discourages employment.

As we consider higher and higher minimum wages, those firms where the effect of a higher minimum 
wage is to reduce employment become more and more salient. Those firms where the effect of a higher 
minimum wage is to remove the incentive to run the firm in an inefficiently lean manner become 
less. When the minimum wage is very low, odds are that increasing the minimum wage will boost 
employment. When the minimum wage is higher, odds are that
it will reduce it.

So where is the sweet spot? What is the sweet spot? How can we tell where the sweet spot is?

The first thing to note is that the sweet spot is not the point at which the minimum wage level 
results in the most jobs. The minimum wagea€™ s effect on the level of employment is a side effect. 
The purpose of the minimum wage is to ensure that the market is our servant, not our mastera€”that 
the market was made for man, not man for the market. The market economy needs to deliver a fair 
distribution of income and wealth. Having the minimum wage to
make sure that even low-wage jobs are fairly remunerated is an important part of that.

As Adam Smith wrote back in 1776:

No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are 
poor and miserablea€!

And he went on to immediately add:

It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, clothe, and lodge the whole body of the people, 
should have such a share of the produce of their own labor as to be themselves tolerably well fed, 
clothed, and lodgeda€!

The sweet spot for society as a whole is above the point at which the employment-inducing effect of 
the minimum wage is exactly offset by the growing employment-shrinking effect.

The second thing to note is that a good minimum wage policy is one that is properly supported by 
other policies. There is, in addition to the minimum wage, the Earned Income Tax Credit: the 
government tops off your wage via sending you a check if your hourly wage is sufficiently low. 
Expansing the Earned Income Tax Credit both gets more money torelatively poor workers are increases 
employment byproviding workers with an incentive totake jobs at
wages they would otherwise find not worthwhile. If you are worried about the disemployment effect 
of the minimum wage, there is a simple solution: when you raise the minimum wage, also expand the 
EITC so that the employment-inducing effect of the second offsets the employment-reducing effect of 
the first.

So why, you may ask, have a minimum wage at all? Why not just have an EITC? The problem is that the 
IRS is not set up to evaluate and audit EITC claims. The IRS is set up to deal with data flowing in 
in which there are powerful incentives to create accurate data. A firm that underinvoices what it 
sold diminishes its own tax liability, but that underinvoice means that the firm it sold to must 
thereby underestimate its own costs, and so raise its tax liability. By
contrast, EITC-relevant reports have no such internal checks. It is thus a€oedifficult to 
administera€D fairly and cheaplya€”a lot of energy needs to be devoted to checking to achieve a 
tolerable a€oeerror ratea€D. Not that the EITC is a bad program. But it is not a perfect program.

By contrast, the minimum wage is easy to administer. Once the minimum wage is broadly known, it all 
but administers itself. Workers know what the minimum wage is, and to whom they should complain if 
they are stiffed. On the one hand a program that all but administers itself, but that at some point 
has a disemployment effect. On the other handa program that has an employment-encouraging effect, 
but that isdifficult and costly to administera€”and
requires taxes somewhere else in the system with their own drawbacks to finance. There are 
tradeoffs, so you seek a balance. Thus a good income-support policy for low-wage workers should 
have both an EITC and a minimum-wage component. It should not be all one or all the other.

A parenthetical remark: If you find anyone who claims that the minimum wage ought to be set at the 
employment-maximizing levela€”at which the employment-inducing and employment-discouraging effects 
balance out, without noting that making the wage distribution fairer is a goal and that a higher 
minimum wage than the zero-effect level is in fact the sweet spota€”they are not your friend. They 
are not trying to educate you or discuss issues with you, but
to deceive you and swindle you. Similarly, if you find anyone who talks about the minimum wage in 
isolationa€’’without ever noting that when you worry about disemployment effects you should not 
just moderate the increase in the minimum wage but also adjust other employment-encouraging 
policies at the margin as wella€”they are, also, not your friend. They are not trying to educate 
you or discuss issues with you, but to deceive you and swindle you.

So with all that as prologue: What should the minimum wage be in the U.S. today? And should it vary 
from place to place? And how much should it vary from place to place?

To answer that, we need to decide (i) what the world is actually like, and (ii) how much we care 
about boosting the incomes of low-wage workers on the one hand via discouraging employment on the 
other. The first is not an ideological question, but an empirical-technocratic one. What is the 
answer?


I Am Disappointed with the CBO Here


Congressional Budget Office

Nonpartisan Analysis for the U.S. Congress

The Budgetary Effects of
the Raise the Wage Act

of 2021                    FEBRUARY 2021

If enacted at the end of March 2021, the Raise the Wage Act of 2021 (S. 53, as introduced on
January 26, 2021) would raise the federal minimum wage, in annual increments, to $15 per hour
by June 2025 and then adjust it to increase at the same rate as median hourly wages. In this
report, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill’s effects on the federal budget.

■  The cumulative budget deficit over the 2021-2031 period would increase by $54 billion.
Increases in annual deficits would be smaller before 2025, as the minimum-wage increases
were being phased in, than in later years.

■  Higher prices for goods and services—stemming from the higher wages of workers paid at or
near the minimum wage, such as those providing long-term health care—would contribute to
increases in federal spending.

■  Changes in employment and in the distribution of income would increase spending for some
programs (such as unemployment compensation), reduce spending for others (such as
nutrition programs), and boost federal revenues (on net).

They nowhere say what they
assume for the own-wage
elasticity

• But their estimates seem to assume an
own-wage elasticity of -0.5

I think it is in the range of between 0
and -0.15

Where does -0.5 come from?

•  30% chance of -0.2; 40% chance of

-0.3; 30% chance of.  1.1?????

•  I cannot follow the logic here at all...

2020-02-11

Unfortunately, if you want the answer to that, you cannot look at Phil Swagela€™ s Congressional 
Budget Office <https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56975-Minimum-Wage.pdf> right now. It says 
that the employment elasticity a€’’the amount by which employment falls when the minimum wage 
risesa€”is -0.48. Or, rather, it does not **say** that. As Jordan Weissman wrote 
<https://slate.com/business/2021/02/minimum-wage-hikes-cbo-relief-bill-
democrats.html>: a€oein a stark and slightly suspicious failure of wonk transparency, the budget 
office did not actually state outright the number they chose to use anywhere in their reporta€la€D 
Ita€™ s not a slightly suspicious failure, Jordan: ita€™ s an unprofessional lapse. I expected 
professional behavior from Phil. And I am greatly disappointed.

The CBOa€™ s estimates of an increase in the minimum wage to $15/hour nationwide are: an extra $33 
billion a year in pay to low-wage workers, a 900,000 reduction in the number of people in poverty, 
and a 1.4 million reduction in employment. That correspondsa€”but recall the CBO does not saya€”to 
an estimated employment elasticity of -0.48. And that is very large. My estimate of the employment 
elasticity over the range from the current value to


^ib/nour is mat it is probably somewnere between u and -u.ib.

How did they get to -0.48? Since they do not say that that is what they use, they choose not to 
defend it at all. Again, unprofessional. They do say that had they followed the methodology they 
followed when they last looked at the issue in 2019, they would have estimated 1.1 rather than 1.4 
million. And they do say that they chose 1.4 million because they think there is a chance that the 
elasticity might truly be much bigger than the near-consensus of study
estimates is. We can do some math. Suppose that there were a 40% chance that the near-consensus was 
correct, and that the near-consensus was 1.1.; suppose that there were a 30% chance that the 
near-consensus was pessimistic, and that the optimistic number was 0.8; and suppose that there were 
a 30% chance that the near-consensus was optimistic.

What would the pessimistic number have to be to make sense of 1.4? It would have to bea€! 2.4 
million. With 30%-40%-30% probabilities, and 0.2 and 0.3 optimistic and near-consensus 
elasticities, the pessimistic-scenario elasticity would, arithmetically, have to be 1.1: in the 
pessimistic scenario, raising the minimum wage would **reduce** the total income of low-wage 
workers because the share fired would be greater than the proportional wage increase.
I                                                                                                   
                                                                                                    
        know of no economist of note and reputation who believes that that is true in the range 
from the current minimum wage to $15/hour. I may have gotten the CBOa€™ s calculations 
wronga€”they, unprofessionally, do not spell them out. But unless I have, I simply see no 
professional method at all here.

So what should the minimum wage be, technocratically a€’’and neoliberally, using market and market 
structuring mechanisms to advance near-consensus societal well-being?

The Minimum Wage Has Fallen Way Behind Productivity

As Heidi Shierholz and my colleague Jesse Rothstein just wrote: a€oeThe rise in inequality over the 
last decades has been a choicea€!. Institutionsa€! have been weakened or attenuated and have helped 
the one percent absorb ever increasing shares of national income. One of the most glaring examples 
of this has been the minimum wagea€!. A wage floor that had kept up with productivity growth since 
the late 1960s would be over $21 per hour todaya€!.
Increasing] the minimum wage in five steps to $15 per hour in 2025a€! [would directly] benefita€! 
32 million workers, their families and their communities. Nearly one-third (31 percent) of Black 
workers, more than one-quarter (26 percent) of Hispanic workers and 26 percent of womena€!a€D

My view: we could afford the minimum wage back in 1968a€”it had no significant disemployment 
effect. You might argue that a good part of the increase in income inequlaity and since reflects 
a€cetechnologya€D and not a€oeinstitutionsa€na€”and I would say that that is why Bernie Sanders and 
company are only proposing $15 and not $21. The a€oetechnology vs. institutionsa€n debate over the 
causes of rising inequality has already been taken into
account in choosing $15.

I do believe the argument against a nationwide $15 an hour minimum wage has some bite in 
low-productivity and low-wage states. Unfortunately, I find that I cannot trust state governments 
in low-productivity states to properly value the interests of their low-wage workers. If I could be 
reasonably sure that state governments wanted a carveout from the $15/hour minimum wage because 
they really believed that that was best for their statesa€™ low-wage
workers, I would be enthusiastically in favor of such a carveout. But since I am reasonably sure 
that is not the case, what to do?

I propose that states that seek a carveout from the $15/hour minimum wage do so by topping-off the 
EITC in their states instead. And if a state is not willing to offer such a top-off? It should not 
be offered a carveout. That, I believe, is incentive compatible. And fair.

It is, I think, corrosive of our democracy and our republic that opponents of minimum-wage 
increases rest their argument on junk economics claims that raising the minimum wage would be bad 
for low-wage workers, without putting forward ancillary policies to mitigate the harms they claim 
that they are concerned about, it is corrosive because, I think, those who do say they worry about 
disemployment effects are, for the most part, worried about something
elsea€”they think that the market is fair, and that disturbing the marketa€™ s distribution of 
income via a minimum wage is unfair. But they do not want to say that. And so we have a public 
sphere that is fed lies. And it does not work very well.
