First:

This paper seems to me to bury the leada€”which is that it is the interaction of past slave-raiding 
and present decolonization that seems to be associated with very low present-day
economic productivity. What are the mechanisms that could generate such an association?:

Margherita Bottero & BjA^rn Wallace: Is There a Long-Term Effect of Africaa€™ s Slave Trades?'. a€™ 
[The] negative relationship between past slave
exports and economic performance within Africaa€! did not become significantly negative until 1970, 
and that it was close to zero in 1960a€!

Paragraphs:

Tae Kim: Intela€™ s Plan to Take On TSMC & Win Big in Chips Has Big Risks: a€~Intela€™ s strategic 
pivot to chip making comes at an ideal moment, but that wona€™ t make
its task any easiera€!. Intel will spend $20 billion to build two new factories in Arizona, vastly 
expanding capacity for both internal use and for customers of its new program, called
a€oelntel Foundry Services," or IFSa€!. Herea€™ s the biggest question for the chipmaker: Can it 
win a large chunk of business away from market leader Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co.? During his strategy presentation, Gelsinger confirmed for the first time that 
the company will be using TSMC to manufacture some of its top-of-the-line CPU
processors  in 2023. This is a result of years of Intel delays in moving to the latest chipmaking 
technologies. With Intel compelled to use TSMC for some of its leading products,
ita€™    s going to be difficult at least in the near term for the company to argue that its 
services are significantly better than its Asian rivala€!. There are some tail winds for

Intela€™ s manufacturing businessa€! security concernsa€! future subsidies and tax incentives from 
the Biden administration^!. While it is easy for Intel to talk a big game about
building a a€ceworld-classa€D foundry business, it will be much harder to create a viable and 
profitable onea€! LINK: <https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-

Martin Weitzman: Prices vs. Quantities: a€~The benefit of a final good is essentially the utility 
which arises out of consuming the good. It could be highly curved at the optimum
output level if tastes happen to be kinked at certain critical pointsa€!. Our intuitive feeling, 
which is confirmed by the formal analysis, is that it doesna€™ t pay to a€oefool
arounda€D with prices in such situationsa€!. There is, it seems to me, a rather fundamental reason 
to believe that quantities are better signals for situations demanding a high
degree                                                                                   of 
coordination. A classical example would be the short run production planning of intermediate 
industrial materials. Within a large production organization, be it the
General Motors Corporation or the Soviet industrial sector as a whole, the need for balancing the 
output of any intermediate commodity whose production is relatively specialized
to this organization and which cannot be effortlessly and instantaneously imported from or exported 
to a perfectly competitive outside world puts a kink in the benefit function. If it
turns out that production of ball bearings of a certain specialized kind (plus reserves) falls 
short of anticipated internal consumption, far more than the value of the unproduced
bearings can be losta€! LINK: <https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/weitzman/files/prices_vs_

Dan Wang: China, the U.S., & Technology: a€~The economic relationship between China and the US is 
massive. Over the last few years, US direct exports of goods and services
to China clocks in at around $200 billion every single year, but thata€™ s really dwarfed by the 
amount of sales that US companies make in China, which the last figure we have
from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the US is $600 billiona€!

Emily Stewart: Inflation: What Is It, Will Rates Change, & What Economists Think the Risks Are, 
Explained'. a€~I spent most of 2008 to 2014 in Argentina, a country that is one of
the examples of hyperinflation people often invoke to scare others about the dangers of 
inflationa€!. Prices are constantly going up, to the point that restaurants sometimes just write
menu prices on stickers, and cash isna€™ t really worth saving, at least not in pesos. People and 
businesses rush to convert their pesos to dollars because theya€™ re aware the
currency is unstable. The country has a dual exchange rate: the a€ceofficiala€D rate and the black 
market rate, known as the a€ceblue.a€D Right now, the official rate is about 90
pesos  to the dollar, the blue is about 140. If youa€™ re paid in dollars, ita€™ s a good deal. If 
youa€™ re paid in pesos, it sucks, and prices are going up a lot faster than wages.

Consumers pay for stuff in a bunch of interest-free installments when they can because the 
assumption is everything will probably be way more expensive soona€!. What some
economists are worried about right now is that the US might be headed toward a a€™ 70s-like period 
of inflation, due in large part to the federal governments™ s response to the
pandemic, most recently President Bidena€™ s $1.9 trillion Covida€‘T9 relief billa€!. Is the 
worst-case scenario the likeliest scenario? In a word, no. Therea€™ s reason to stay
vigilanta€”as policymakers say they area€”but not reason to panica€!. That doesna€™ t mean the Fed 
wouldna€™ t react if things go awry, or that Powell and Yellen might not
wind    up being wrong in their predictions. But doomsday isna€™ t the most probable scenario on 
the horizon, or close to ita€!. Soelnflation has been very low for over a decade.
And, you know, ita€™ s a risk, but ita€™ s a risk that the Federal Reserve and others have tools to 
address,a€D Yellen told CNBC in February. a€oeThe greater risk is of scarring
the people, we having this pandemic take a permanent lifelong toll on their lives and 
livelihoodsa€Da€!
