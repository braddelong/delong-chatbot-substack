We're here to celebrate the birth of this book: <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em>. We have the author here in person. We almost are without empty seats. This is fabulous. Our discussants today are Barry Eidlin from McGill, Emily Merchant from UC Davis, Jari Eloranta from the University of Helsinki, and myself. We’re going to each get a chance to say something about Brae’s book. But first we're going to ask Brad himself to tell us.</p><p><strong>Brad DeLong:</strong> Thank you very much . One of the great things about having finally managed to get this book out has been to discover how many friends I have, and how many friends the book has, and how many friends economic history has, and how many people are interested in thinking and thinking hard about what we know about the long run shape of human economic history.

And around that time in the year 2000, Paul Krugman wrote an opinion piece in <em>The New York Times</em> in which refers to Brad's book in progress. </p><p>So for getting it done, congratulations. </p><p>I still have the question of how the title cannot even change.</p><p><strong>Brad DeLong:</strong> I could not think of a better one. I tried and tried. But you're William Butler Yeats is the best.</p><p><strong>Simone Wegge:</strong> <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em> made the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list for nonfiction books in September, and their bestseller lists for books in business in the month of October. And then if you go to Amazon, you can see that this week, it was fifth in macroeconomics books on Amazon, and 13th in economic history books,</p><p><strong>Brad DeLong</strong>: Actually higher than fifth. The fifth rank includes three different versions of Ray Dalio…</p><p><strong>Simone Wegge:</strong> Amazon also tells us that the reading age is 13 years old, and grade 11 and up. </p><p>I beg to differ. </p><p>I made use of the audio version. And there were many times when I had to rewind to make sure I had gotten Brad's point.</p><p>Let me describe the subject matter and the breadth of the book a little bit more. The breath of economic and political events it covers is wide ranging. The geographic range is also very wide—he goes all over the world. It's very accessible to a very wide audience. There are no equations providing some complicated economic model. There's no tedious econometrics, nothing about instrumental variables, identification strategies, diff-in-diff estimation, etc, etc. cetera, et cetera, et cetera, which would bore the non economists of the world. The writing engages the reader. Brad has striking stories to tell you. Every other page, he comes up with some fact of describe some interesting socio-economic relationship, or uses a turn of phrase that is clever, and adroit.

But is the era of cheap money over?… Eventually, the boost to the economy from pandemic aid will fade away. And once that happens, we’ll probably be back where we were before the pandemic, with weak private investment demand holding interest rates down. Why will investment demand be weak?… The <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/accelerator-effect/?te=1&amp;nl=paul-krugman&amp;emc=edit_pk_20221118">accelerator effect</a>…. Investment spending will only remain high if we expect rapid economic growth. And what we know now doesn’t support that expectation…. Why the slowdown? Demography indeed plays a role…. Another important factor is that aforementioned midlife crisis in technology…. What all this suggests to me is that the era of cheap money is not, in fact, over. A few years from now, we’ll probably be back to a situation in which too much saving is chasing too few investment opportunities...</p></blockquote><p>Our 10-year inflation-protected Treasury, security, the TIPS—which is market traders’ putting-their-money-where-their-mouth-is expectations of inflation—does not go back into the past millennium. But we can construct a very crude proxy for real Treasury long interest rates by subtracting the past year’s core inflation from the nominal 10-year Treasury rate. The two track each other well since 2004, save for the period immediately after the nadir of the Great Recession, when bond traders wrongly expected inflation to rise with recovery, and except for the past year, when the rebound supply-chain and now Russian attack inflation also has taken bond traders by surprise:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F553e482a-116c-4cb1-b42b-784f97012f61_1574x818.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F553e482a-116c-4cb1-b42b-784f97012f61_1574x818.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F553e482a-116c-4cb1-b42b-784f97012f61_1574x818.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F553e482a-116c-4cb1-b42b-784f97012f61_1574x818.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F553e482a-116c-4cb1-b42b-784f97012f61_1574x818.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/553e482a-116c-4cb1-b42b-784f97012f61_1574x818.png" width="1456" height="757" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/553e482a-116c-4cb1-b42b-784f97012f61_1574x818.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:757,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:180541,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F553e482a-116c-4cb1-b42b-784f97012f61_1574x818.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F553e482a-116c-4cb1-b42b-784f97012f61_1574x818.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F553e482a-116c-4cb1-b42b-784f97012f61_1574x818.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F553e482a-116c-4cb1-b42b-784f97012f61_1574x818.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Looking further back into history, we see:</p><ol><li><p>A period before 1965, when the <em>ex ante</em> 10-year expected Treasury rate was about 2.5%.</p></li><li><p>The post-1965 inflation, when the past year’s inflation is really not a good proxy for what <em>ex ante</em> inflation expectations were, and it is hard to figure out what real long-term bond rates were.</p></li><li><p>The Volcker disinflation of highly elevated long-term real interest rates from 1981-1985. </p></li><li><p>The post-Volcker “Great Moderation” period, in which the <em>ex ante</em> 10-year expected Treasury rate was about 3.5%.</p></li><li><p>The post-2001 period of increasingly despressed real interest rates—either the global savings glut, secular stagnation, or the global safe asset shortage, depending on your theoretical model.</p></li><li><p>The return toward pre-2001 normalcy that we see right now.</p></li></ol><p>But what if we want to look not at nominal-safe assets—those that are useful as collateral and as safety anchors—but at profit rates, at real rates of return on risky assets?

Yet the <a href="http://www.publicreason.ro/articol/49">normative logic of social insurance</a> is Paretian, reflecting the contractarian imperative to efficiently compensate the potential “losers” from creative-destruction, and thus isn’t merely instrumental to growth. The preference-neutrality and positive-sum logic of a Pareto improvement makes it easily confused with utilitarianism, but the two have quite different implications. Utilitarianism is top-down…. Paretians, in contrast, start with the bottom-up process of exchange and transaction….

Well, sort of, because your upside is unbounded and your downside is bounded at your entire net worth. But most people don’t do this, because … they really don’t want to lose all of their money. (Of course those people are lame and not EAs; this blog endorses double-or-nothing coin flips and high leverage.)” In other words, according to their own public statements, Bankman-Fried and Ellison both believed that they had a moral obligation to make “double-or-nothing” financial bets over and over again—even though this would almost certainly lead to financial ruin eventually—because there was a small chance that they would just keep winning such bets, and thereby save humanity. And some of the world’s most reputable investors handed them billions of dollars anyway…</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Michael Pettis: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/BrakelsRonald/status/1594319554871963648">‘The easiest way to convince someone else of a lie is to believe it yourself</a>: Because I've been devouring books and papers on financial history for over 30 years, I thought understood from fairly early on how risky the crypto space was and how likely to be filled with scammers and pyramid schemes. The emerging picture of what went wrong suggests the crypto empire was a mess almost from the start, with few boundaries, financial or personal. And yet I still find all these article about SBF fascinating because they add a lot to the historical accounts. For example I had always assumed there was a sharper difference between the scammers that took advantage and the unsophisticated victims they exploited. But from these accounts it occurs to me that the self-delusion was so deep that it drove the scammers as much as it drove the victims…</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
