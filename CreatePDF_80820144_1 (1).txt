DRAFT: Review of Nouriel Roubinia€™s Megathreats:


Nouriel Roubini Wrestling the Ten Megathreats, by Stable Diffusion via Night Cafea€!

The booka€’’Nouriel Roubinia€™ s Megathreats: Ten Dangerous Trends That Imperil Our Future, & How 
to Survive Them <https://www.amazon.com/dp/031628405X/> is written in Nouriel's a€oeDr. DoomaGD 
personaa€”that does sell, and sell very well:

1. Debt spirals and crises,

2. their amplification by our very limited societal private-sector and public-sector ability to 
deal smoothly with large-scale bankruptcy situations,

3. the increased costs of caring for an aging population,

4. overreliance on an easy-money cure for a€oesecular stagnation^ □,

5. threatening stagflation,

6. our continued failure to design a stable international financial system,

7. the threatened loss of many of the benefits of the division of labor via a retreat from 
globalization,

8. out-of-control AI hacking our brains to our detriment,

9. the New Cold War between China and the U.S .A.,

10. and global warming.
These are indeed megathreats.

And Nouriel doesna€™t even mention:

• democracy-in-decline,

• rising klepto-plutocracy, or

•  the increasing mismatch between our system of property with the incentives it generates and the 
requirements for mobilizing humanitya€™ s anthology intelligence for our collective benefit.

But while the a€oeDr. Dooma€D persona makes the book arresting and indeed essential reading for 
people who want a guide to point them to what our problems are, the same characteristics that make 
it arresting also make it a not very good guide to any realistic assessment of what we do indeed 
face.

So, in my rereading, I turned back to the final chapter, which is Nouriel at the most optimistic he 
allows himself to bea€”chapter 12: a€oeA More a€~Utopiana€™ Future. I did so looking for some 
cheer. But I did not find any. The problem is that Nouriel finds that he can only become optimistic 
by ceasing to be realistic.
Nouriel writes:

High-powered economic growtha€! say, between 5 and 6 percent GDP sustained over time in advanced 
economiesa€! pay[s] down the debts that threaten usa€! generates resources that can help us tackle 
expensive public projects to forestall climate change, aginga€! tech unemployment^! future 
pandemics. It reduces political tensions and strife. Higher growth is driven to a great extent by 
technological innovationsa€!. Innovations
might create cheap energy in large quantities without emitting greenhouse gasesa€!. I marvel at an 
accelerating pace of biomedical discoveriesa€!. DeepMinda€™ s AlphaFolda€! augurs well for 
accelerating progress againsta€! diseasesa€!. Technology that accelerates growth at a rapid pace is 
a key allya€!

These will not solve all of our problems:

Replacing humans with robots will still tend to increase inequality, culminating in widespread 
structural tech unemployment. Many people whose jobs vanish will end up earning smaller paychecks 
for less satisfying work. That has happened to factory workers in the United States and Europe, and 
their pain is reala€!

But they will solve many of them. Indeed:

Sluggish growth and inequality spur populism, and populism stirs economic nationalism. Strong, 
inclusive, and sustainable growth keeps both trends in checka€!

And such growth would recenter the world and restore to it a unified commitment to extending peace, 
prosperity, and democracy:

Advanced industrial states and successful emerging markets. Their prosperity will beckon to 
countries wobblinga€!. Western values would likely prevaila€!. A rejuvenated Western system would 
counteract calls for deglobalization and protectionism^!

I think Nouriel is right. This would indeed solve our big problems or reduce them to little 
problems. This would give us the resources to compensate losers from change, and to deal with all 
those of our problems that can be solved via resource mobilization. Moreover, the better technology 
we would gain in the process would make most of our other big problems, solvable as well. 5% per 
year real national income growth in the global north would indeed be a

panacea.

But the prospects for 5% per year real national income growtha€’’through some combination of 
immigration and productivity growth acceleration^’’are very dim indeed. In the global north, even 
moderate rates of immigration trigger forces that lead to perceive immigrants as threats rather 
than helpers. Global-frontier productivity increase at a rate of more than 2% per year requires 
institutions that we do not know how to build.

It is strange. We know that 40 years from now frontier level of global technology will support an 
economy between 50% and 100% more productive than we are today. So why not set a goal: Do 
everything we will do over the next 40 years to boost productivity, but do it all in 20 years. 
Start next January. In January, do whatever you would normally do to boost productivity in January 
and February, and do so by bringing productivity-boosting activities forward
from February into January and pushing activities that do not boost productivity off from January 
into February. Then repeat.

Yet nobody believes that anything like this is possible. There are diminishing returns to 
investments ’’diminishing returns of all kinds. There are limited capacities for absorption and 
reconfiguration. There is Fred BrooksS™ s Mythical Man Month', if you double the number of 
programmers devoted to a project, you do not halve the time needed to finish, but rather you find 
that the time needed to finish is significantly greater than if you had just left the situation
alone. There needs to be time: time to experiment, observe, reformulate, rejigger, and deploy. And 
then to experiment again, and restart the cycle.

But should such diminishing returns be an insurmountable obstacles? Perhaps, when global-frontier 
productivity growth was 2% per year, democracies were stable, and there were no 
civilization-shaking, urgent problems like global warming far closer than horizon, we could be 
satisfied with 2%/year global-frontier technology growth. But now we do not een have thata€”my 
forecast is 1% per year. We have global warming that we have not dealt with and need

Some Super-Sputnik-Moment effort seems to be called fora€”that is the message I get from Nouriela€™ 
s book. But what effort? By whom? And how?
