Paragraphs:

When you buy an option from somebody who then delta-hedges it, what you really have done is: (a) 
taken a very small position in the underlying, and (b) committed to a positive­
feedback trading strategy that will continually plow a very large share of notional profits you may 
earn on your position back into the underlying by massively raising your leverage:

Robert Armstrong: The Nope Theory to Explain Volatility in Equity Markets'. a€~One factor in many 
of the strangest market episodes is the shadow cast
by the equity options marketa€!. Options to buy and sell shares have to be hedged by the dealers 
which offer them. When options-related volume is a
significant portion of the market, this makes the market unstablea€L The delta of an option changes 
with the price of the underlying stock. So if a stock
really  starts to run up, dealers of options in it have to buy more of it to hedge the options they 
have sold. This adds to the upwards price pressurea€!. This
kind                                                                     of snowball was behind the 
more violent spikes in GameStop, a name retail option buyers piled into heavily. The punchline is 
that the state of the
equity options market at any given moment tells you something about pressures that will be 
subsequently felt in the equity market itselfa€”and it should be
possible to trade on this facta€!. Francusa€™ core concept is an indicator called Nopea€! a 
rough-and-readya€! gauge of the weight the options market is
exerting on the stock market. It estimates the amount of the liquidity available in a certain stock 
or index that is being sopped up by options dealersa€™
hedginga€! the delta of all the outstanding a€oecalla€n options to buy stocks, less the delta of 
all the a€ceputa€D options to sell them, divided by the

total daily volume trading of the shares. When Nope gets unusually high, Francus says, a€oethe 
market has a strong tendency to reversea€Da€;. This
volatility-encouraging character of options is a nice iteration of a familiar Wall Street irony: a 
financial instrument designed to manage risk is turned into a
speculative  device, making the market riskier. Credit default and total returns swaps are two 
other good examplesa€!

Duncan Black: This Again'. a€~If only there was some way employers could attract more workers to 
jobs:a€oea€™ Ia€™ ve never seen it this bada€™ , said Arnold, president of
Look Trailers, based in Middlebury, Indiana. Look builds utility trailers, which are in heavy 
demand from small businesses such as landscapers and plumbers as well as hobbyists
who use them to haul motorcycles or other bulky sports equipments!. Wages at his trailer factories 
are already far above state or federal minimums. The average starting pay is $19
an hour, while workers with skills such as welders make $24 an hour or more. a€~People talk about 
the oil boom in the Dakotasa€”how workers would get in their car and drive
out to get jobsa€™ , he said. a€~We have the same thing here, a jobs boom. But nobodya€™ s 
coming.a€™ a€!a€oe Way above the minimum and still the ungrateful peasants
wona€™ t come!!! $24 hour full time 50 weeks per year is $48,000. This is not a lot of money. This 
is not a€Dmove across the country to Middlebury, Indiana" moneya€!

Ezra Klein: The Best Explanation ofBidena€™s Thinking Ia€™ve Heard'. a€~With the $2 trillion 
American Jobs Plan, the economic theory that is Bidenomics is taking shape.

risksa^”losinff the. House ffivincr Donald Tnimn a nath hark to nowera^”than some.


traditional economic risks, like wasting money and bumping up inflation. It prefers to err on the 
side of spending more and making sure people know they got a bridge or a job than
doing less and having people question whether government is working for them. But I still have a 
lot of questions about Bidenomicsa€!. Brian Deese is the director of the National
Economic Councila€!. I asked Deese to join me on the podcast to talk about how his economic 
policymaking and thinking have changed since 2009a€!. "Growing economic
inequality  a€! was laid bare during the pandemica€!. Climate change; wea€™ ve also seen the impact 
acceleratinga€! [and] having an economic strategy that is unresponsive or
agnostic  to those issues is no longer a viable optiona€!. One of the important things politically 
is making sure that the ultimate beneficiaries of the things you are trying to
accomplish                                                                              know and 
understand what youa€™re trying to accomplish^!. The president is thinkinga€!. When hea€™ s 
thinking about the infrastructure investments necessary, a
lot of it is in contraposition to what he is seeing China doing in terms of strategic 
investmentsa€!. There is a big questiona€!. Can the United States deliver for its own citizens? Can
the United States competently govern and invest in things that are obviously beneficial to its own 
welfare, its economic strength, its economic resilience? Because the world has
watched now for a couple of years where the United States operated in a way that was very difficult 
for our international counterparts to fathom. That is really the dominant
questiona€!. Can the U.S. get its house in order? And that question is inevitably framed vis-A -vis 
Chinaa€!

Greg Robb: Fed Officials Split on Outlook for Inflation'. a€~Federal Reserve officials seemed 
divided evenly into two camps about the outlook for inflation, according to minutes of
their March meeting released on Wednesday. a€ceSeverala€D Fed officials said that supply 
bottlenecks and strong demand would push up price inflation a€oemore than

anticipated ,a€D the minutes said. At the same time, a€ ce sever al a€D other Fed officials 
expressed belief that the factors that had contributed to low inflation over the past decade
a€oecould again exert more downward pressure on inflation than expected.a€D The Fed upgraded its 
forecast for growth and employment and forecast that headline inflation would
rise  to 2.4% rate this yeara€”above the 2% targeta€”but then settle down to 2.1% by 2023. Despite 
these changes, the Feda€™ s median forecast was for no liftoff in interest rates
through 2023. The central bank cut its policy interest rates to zero last March. The Fed said it 
would maintain this easy stance until the economy returns to full employment, and
inflation has risen to 2% and was on track to rise moderately above 2% for some timea€!

Jim Tankersley: With Warning to Democrats, Manchin Points the Way for Bidena€™ s Agenda: a€~The 
West Virginia Democrata€™ s latest plea for bipartisanship suggested that,
to win over a critical swing vote in his own party, President Biden will first have to reach out to 
Republicansa€!. The chances that such a compromise will materialize are slima€!.

Manchina€™ s calls for bipartisanship were less an insurmountable obstacle for Democrats than a 
road map for Mr. Bidena€! reaching out to Republicans to explore possible areas
of compromise while laying the groundwork to steer around them if no such deal materializesa€!. 
Bidena€! aim[s] at increasing the pressure on Republicans to compromised”and,
if they will not, giving Mr. Manchin and other moderate Democrats whose backing Mr. Biden needs the 
political cover to accept an all-Democratic plana€!. [Biden] urged
Republicans to a€oelisten to your constituents ,a€D arguing that voters across America back 
infrastructure spending on the scale Mr. Biden envisionsa€!. Smaller pieces that could
attract                                                                                 10 or more 
Republican votes each, starting with a bill focused on supply chains and competition with Chinaa€!. 
Postponing Mr. Bidena€™ s proposed tax increases on
corporationsa€! if doing so would get Republicans on board with a spending billa€!. Manchina€! has 
blared his message: First, try bipartisanship. a€oeSenate Democrats must
avoid the temptation to abandon our Republican colleagues on important national issues ,a€D Mr. 
Manchin wrote in the Washington Post op-ed on Thursday. a€oeRepublicans,
however, have a responsibility to stop saying no, and participate in finding real compromisedDa€!

Dan Wang: China, the U.S., & Technology. a€~China has become a lot more brutal than I expected and 
then second of all, China looks a lot more successful than I expectedd!.
You have to be able to recognize that things in China are getting worse, and then things in China 
are also getting better, just depends on the particular segment. China last year
looked especially brutal, as it was able to control the virus fairly successfully. I think the 
lived experience to all of us in Beijing where I was based, right now Ia€™ m in Shanghai,
was that China was able to control everything more or less by April of last year and it was really 
able to get its factories restarted by thena€!. China was really, really good at
figuring out these short-term problems. The central government, the local governments, but 
especially the companies themselves were able to organize production effectively and
what Ia€™ m now hearing from so many companies now is that China is still the worlda€™ s best 
growth story. That was the case in 2020, and that might still be the case for the
next 10 years relative to a lot of other emerging countries. In addition to that, China is the 
worlda€™ s best place to manufacture so many different types of goods and theya€™re
more or less doubling down a lot more on China as a major market and also as a producera€!. Ia€™ ve 
come to the view now thata€! we have to spend much more time taking a
look at whata€™ s going on with the leading companiesa€!. There are some areas of Chinese 
technological success, I would cite areas like solar panels, high-speed rail, mobile
telephony equipment, so this is the 5G stuff that Huawei has become really good at. But if you take 
a look at a much bigger ticket items, things like semiconductors or aviation
technologies, China has been a manifest failurea€!
