Go read my review, then go read Brad's book…. Brad… knew he was swinging for the fences and he cared about getting it right. There's an intellectual flexibility at work in the book that I find really admirable, even when I don't necessarily agree….&nbsp;</p><p>Economic history is… unusual field. <em>Good </em>economists study it closely, but there is nevertheless <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/on-the-wisdom-of-the-historians">an allergy to history</a> in some corners…. Economists who love math think stories about the past are unscientific, and they’re right. But numbers without narrative are meaningless…. Understanding economics from an historical perspective helps demystify it—we come to grips with how different economic policy initiatives are supposed to work, and what problems they were developed to solve…. Starting with the financial crisis of 2008, a lot of smart people who had taken the economic orthodoxy of the 1990s for granted started to look more carefully at its intellectual and political roots… discarded the strictest elements of the 1990s orthodoxy for free trade and balanced budgets… acknowledged that budget deficits are not the apocalyptic threat they were once presented to be… monetary policy is not<em> </em>the ideal or only appropriate tool for economic management, that austerity is politically dangerous, and that under-investment and unemployment are the most serious economic problems facing the world….</p><p>Over the past few months, however, we've watched central banks in Europe and the United States pivot to what strikes me as an indefensibly bleak view of economic management—the insistence that higher interest rates and higher unemployment are not only an effective way to combat inflation, but also somehow humane and, in any case, unavoidable…. One day Larry Summers says we need <a href="https://slate.com/business/2022/07/larry-summers-massive-unemployment-fed-inflation.html">sustained, high unemployment</a> to cure inflation, and the next he points out that <a href="https://twitter.com/LHSummers/status/1572433427365826565">unemployment is jet fuel for fascism</a>. Jason Furman <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/an-economists-case-against-biden-student-loan-forgiveness-plan/671259/">rails against student debt relief</a> as a 0.2 percent tax on the poor, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-scariest-economics-paper-of-2022-federal-reserve-interest-rates-median-inflation-unemployment-labor-market-job-openings-11662582326">then calls to add more than four million names to the unemployment rolls</a>. If you are concerned about the plight of the poor, in my view, it is a bad idea to throw them out of work by the millions, especially if you think doing so will enhance the appeal of authoritarian politics….</p><p>In June, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIK9UogQBjE">thoughtfully emphasizing the limits of monetary policy</a>…. Gas prices are down dramatically since June, and to the limited extent that inflation expectations can be quantified in financial markets, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1576218863959650306">those expectations have been falling for months</a>. And yet with no apparent revision to his summertime framework, Powell abruptly vowed in September to continue tightening monetary policy until inflation disappears, all consequences for employment, investment and social stability be damned. Nor is this a strictly American problem…. Nobody can really say <em>why</em> we have to throw so many people out of work, but apparently everyone really wants to do it….</p><p>And do <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/a-dose-of-rational-optimism">read the review</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Let me set out a few quick points:</p><ol><li><p>Economic theory can be nothing other than distilled or crystalized economic history—after all, what else can it possibly be?</p></li><li><p>When applied to policy issues, people relying on economic theory need to realize that it is not only concentrated historical examples and analogies, but also that it has been adulterated with ideology—and they had better hope the adulterant is only oregano, and not something like peyote.</p></li><li><p>Why is it adulterated with ideology? Because every single generation since 1870 has been trying to figure out how to cobble together, running Econo social code on top of a brand new set of technological forces of production. Since the technological forces of production are brand new, there is no experience to guide us. and since pretending that things are working, even when they are not can get you another year or decade or generation in power, the standard move becomes "my ideas did not fail: they were failed". And thus history gets contaminated with ideology.</p></li><li><p>How reliable are the underlying historical examples and analogies? Not at all. Every generation, as I just said, face is the problem of building, Econo, social software code for humanity that will run on top of a brand new set of technologically enabled forces of production hardware. Thus claiming that our problem, today is essentially the same as the problem of any past generation is certain to be wrong.</p></li><li><p>Since 1870 we have been continually in the situation that teams warned us about back in 1924: “We lack more than usual a coherent scheme of progress, a tangible ideal. All the political parties alike have their origins in past ideas and not in new ideas.... No one has a gospel. The next move is with the head…”</p></li><li><p>With respect to Larry Summers's views of our current inflation problem... Look: There were and are three dangers: (1) insufficient support for a struggling economy that lands us back in secular-stagnation semi-permanent depression, as happened in 2010; (2) insufficient monetary tightening at the appropriate time that lands us in stagflation; (3) a Federal Reserve that does not react early to a strengthening economy and then, when it feels it has fallen behind the curve, panics, and so lands us back into (1) after a short episode of (2). <br><br>Larry is right to worry about (3), and looks to have wise and prescient with his early warnings about how it would be advisable not to get into a situation in which (3) was a danger. <br><br>But we have, and it now is. <br><br>Would Larry look prescient but for Vladimir Putin, OPEC+, and Biden's choice of a highly competent Republican Worthy rather than a Democratic macroeconomist to lead the Fed through this? <br><br>Perhaps not. <br><br>But I will certainly not die on the hill of claiming that he would not.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696d769a-f450-4e18-932d-989a386f8358_2310x794.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696d769a-f450-4e18-932d-989a386f8358_2310x794.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696d769a-f450-4e18-932d-989a386f8358_2310x794.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696d769a-f450-4e18-932d-989a386f8358_2310x794.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696d769a-f450-4e18-932d-989a386f8358_2310x794.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/696d769a-f450-4e18-932d-989a386f8358_2310x794.png" width="1456" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/696d769a-f450-4e18-932d-989a386f8358_2310x794.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:165942,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696d769a-f450-4e18-932d-989a386f8358_2310x794.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696d769a-f450-4e18-932d-989a386f8358_2310x794.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696d769a-f450-4e18-932d-989a386f8358_2310x794.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F696d769a-f450-4e18-932d-989a386f8358_2310x794.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>My view? If the bond-market five-year-ahead five-year breakeven inflation rate—what the bond market “expects” inflation to be between 5 and 10 years from now—is above 2.8%, it is a clear sign from the bond market that the Fed’s monetary policy is not restrictive enough, not because the bond market is infallible but because bond market expectations of inflation are a driver of inflation. If bond-market five-year-ahead five-year breakeven inflation rate—what the bond market “expects” inflation to be between 5 and 10 years from now—is below 2.3%, it is a clear sign from the bond market that the Fed’s monetary policy is too tight. This sign is not dispositive. Other things enter into the general expectations that matter than the bond market’s view.

Thus Chancellor McCormick will then, if the closing does not happen on October 28, rule that Musk has estopped himself from claiming that the problems he had seen are sufficient to release him from his obligation to buy Twitter at $54.20 a share.
