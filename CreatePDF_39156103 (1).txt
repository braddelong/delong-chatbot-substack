Stories have protagonists. They make most of the decisions and take most of the actions. That is 
how we think. A prime minister like Otto von Bismarck maneuvers to retain power.
The working class decides to give him some of their votes in return for national health insurance. 
So Germany chooses, precociously, to march down the road of social insurance
and social democracy. Often this is metaphor: the ocean seeks to climb closer to the moon and so we 
feel the tides, and the lightning chooses to follow the least-resistance path to
the ground.

I started this book with the protagonist, the actor, being humanity as a whole. Collectively and 
individually, we sought a better life for ourselves and security and survival for our
descendants; we took actions; and things happened. The processes and factors seemed almost 
inevitablea€”the actions and decisions of particular individual mostly offset one
another,    and if an opportunity was not seized by one person at one date it was soon enough 
seized by another. We have a sense that things could have turned out very differently. But
we cannot point to a single decision crux where some individual human decided to turn right instead 
of left and so made the difference.

Two chapters ago we shifted our focus from economics to political economy: we needed to look not 
just at technology, production, organization, and exchange, but also at how
people governing themselves and others tried to regulate the economy to preserve or produce a good 
society, or a society good for them.

One chapter ago we shifted our focus to imperial politics: we needed to look not just at how 
peoples and their elites governed themselves, but how they governed others. Each of
these shifts brought us toward processes and factors particular individuals and their actions 
mattered. But, still, they did not quite allow us to reach the level at which the actions of
individuals that we can understand from the inside via our empathy and imagination mattered. Even 
as decisive and important individual as Nikola Tesla simply turned onea€”very
importanta€’’technological clock forward by a decade. Herbert Hoover and Jennie Jerome and Li 
Hongzhang and company are, mostly, not decisive individuals but rather stand-ins
for      thousands if not more whose actions make imperialism, link Britain to the United States, 
and fail to put China on the road to rapid industrialization that Japan followed.

In this chapter we take a further step. We move to where choice and chance are dominant, into war, 
governance, and high politics. In this chapter individuals matter. This fits
awkwardly into an economic history. But it is necessary. For we cannot understand what the world 
was like in 1918 without grappling with World War I. Things could have
happened very differently. And if they had, we today would live in a very different world.

Alas, we do not. For as Angell scribbled, he missed the quite plan fact that humanity had not 
outgrown large scale war.

As we make this shift of perspective to thea€”this is not economistsa€™ distinction between 
a€cemicroa€D and a€cemacroa€D, so leta€™ s call it a€cesystema€D and
a€oeindividuala€na€”the individual level, we see who did what, and we can use our hard-wired 
abilities to get inside the minds of the human actors to understand why. And we
find        that our stories of history become both more and less comprehensible. They become more 
because we understand the making of the decisions. When decisions are made at the
macro-level system-level, a€oedecidinga€™ is only a metaphor. Thus what is causing who and who is 
causing what gets blurred into near incomprehensibility. When decisions are
made  at the individual level, we understand from the inside what happened. Yet, somehow, our 
knowledge remains unsatisfactory. It slips away from us, because we can also see
how key actors might have decided differently, and historical logic thus dissolves into chance and 
confusion.

A paragraph from Ron Rosenbaum's retrospective review of William Shirer's The Rise & Fall of the 
Third Reich that I greatly envy:

Writing The Rise and Fall was an extraordinary act ofa€l literary-historical generalshipa€”to 
conquer a veritable continent of informational that terrain
of horror in a mere 1,250 pagesa€l. Rereading the book, one sees how subtle Shirer is in shifting 
between telescope and microscopea€”even, one might
say, stethoscopea€!

Gerard Roland has written, fairly, that: a€oeAny explanation of WWI is controversial, but the role 
of Russia trying to take parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire is
underestimated herea€D. Indeed, the Romanov Empirea€™ s deciders thought that Austrian Poland and 
Austrian Ukraine ought to be theirs, and would become theirs in the event
of      a collapse of the Dual Monarchy.

a€\pitiful, isolatedd€\: The phrase a€oepitiful, isolateda€D is a callout to Leon Trotskya€™ s 
dismissal of mere writers and thinkersa€”a€ oeunarmed prophetsa€D, as Niccolo
Machiavelli called them in The Princea€.” and to Edmund Wilson, To the Finland Station: A Study in 
the Writing and Acting of History, Garden City: Doubleday and Company,
1955 [1940], p. 505<https://archive.org/details/tofinlandstation00wils>, who meditates on 
Trotskya€™ s dismissal of such:

The remarkable scene at the first congress of the Soviet dictatorship after the success of the 
October insurrection of 1917, when [Leon] Trotsky, with the
contempt and indignation of a prophet, read [the socialist] Martov and his followers out of the 
meeting. a€oeYou are pitiful isolated individuals ,a€D he
cried at this height of the Bolshevik triumph. a€oeYou are bankrupt; your role is played out. Go 
where you belong from now ona€”in the garbage-pile of
history !a€D

These words are worth pondering for the light they throw on the course of Marxist policy and 
thought. Observe that the merging of yourself with the
onrush of the current of history is to save you from the ignoble fate of being a a€oepitiful 
isolated individuala€D; and that the failure to so merge yourself
will relegate you to the garbage-pile of history, where you can presumably be of no more use.

Today [in the late 1930s], though we may agree with the Bolsheviks that Martov was no man of 
action, his croakings over the course that they had adopted
seem to us full of far-sighted intelligence. He pointed out that proclaiming a socialist regime in 
conditions different from those [of advanced
industrialization, high technology, and material abundance] contemplated by Marx would not realize 
the results that Marx expected; that Marx and Engels
had   usually described the a€oedictatorship of the proletariate□ as having the form, for the new 
dominant class, of a democratic republic, with universal
suffrage [for the working class] and the popular recall of officials; that the [Bolshevik] slogan 
a€oeAll power to the Soviets [workersa€™ councils]a€D
had never really meant what it said and that it had soon been exchanged by Lenin for a€oeAll power 
to the Bolshevik Party.a€D

There sometimes turn out to be valuable objects cast away in the garbage pile of history a€’’things 
that have to be retrieved later on. From the point of view
of the Stalinist Soviet Union, that is where [Leon] Trotsky himself is today [in the late 1930s]. 
He might well discard his earlier assumption that an isolated
individual must needs be a€cepitifula€D for the conviction of Dr. Stockman in Ibsena€™ s [play] An 
Enemy of the People that a€oethe strongest man is he
who stands most alonea€!

Trotskya€™ s most influential biographer, Isaac Deutscher, wrestled with these issues. You can see 
it in the titles of the three volumes of his biography: Trotsky: The Prophet
Armed, London: Oxford University Press, 1954 <https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.507702>; 
Trotsky: The Prophet Unarmed, London: Oxford University Press, 1959

replya€”that Deutscher was a€~the only man whose presence in the same academic community I should 
find morally intolerablea€!a€™ Berlin hastened to add that he would have
supported the claims of a C. Wright Mills or an Eric Hobsbawma€!a€D
