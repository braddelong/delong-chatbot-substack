Worthy Reads from Equitable Growth:

1) Six more months of this, and I will start to think that maybe Larry Summers and Olivier 
Blanchard have a point with their fears that perhaps Bidena€™ s $1.9 trillion Rescue plan was a bit 
too large to be optimal:

Kate Bahn & Carmen Sanchez Cumming: Equitable Growtha€™ s Jobs Day Graphs: March 2021 Report 
Edition'. a€~On April 2, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released new data on the U.S. labor 
market during the month of Marcha€!. The U.S. labor market added 916,000 jobsa€! prime-age 
employment-to-populationa€! increased 0.3 percentage pointsa€!. The Latinx unemployment rate 
decreased to 7.9 percent in March
from 8.5 percent in February. Employment growth in March was led by leisure and hospitality and 
education services as in-person activity was able to resume alongside a notable increase in 
construction. Top-line unemployment, also known as Ua€“3, and a broader measure of labor 
underutilization, known as Ua€“6, fell in tandema€!. Fewer unemployed workers were temporarily laid 
off and more were reentering the labor force to
look for worka€!

2) Back in 1993 I remember pleading with my fellow technocrats in the Clinton administration that 
the principle of AFDCa€”that raising children was very valuable social work that society needed to 
find some way to remunerated’’was a true and important one, and that whatever a€oeending welfare as 
we know ita€D meant, it should not mean abandoning that principle. But we did. Abandon it, that is. 
Now I very much hope that it is coming back:

Equitable Growth: The Child Allowance Will Pay Dividends for the Entire U.S. Economy Far into the 
Future'. a€~One feature of the newly enacted American Rescue Plan that got less attention in the 
lead up to its passage than the more headline-grabbing $1,400 economic impact payments are the 
reforms to the Child Tax Credit. The legislation dramatically expands and improves the CTC, making 
it fully refundable and increasing its
value to as much as $300 per child per month. The changes, particularly if they are made permanent, 
will be some of the most profound changes made to the social safety net in decades, with 
far-reaching positive effects not only for individual families but also overall economic mobility 
and growtha€!

3) We have, for a long time, had relatively good theories about how wages are set that are much 
more true than the naive theory that wages are set in a competitive equilibrium process where 
workers are paid some unambiguous and innate a€oemarginal producta€D. Efficiency-wage theories tell 
us that, in the context of the production network, workers are essentially paid their hold-up 
valuesa€’’whatever it takes to incentivize them not to a€ceshirka€D.
Employer-monopsony theories tell us that Labor supply curves are almost always substantially 
elastic, it's only because the local knowledge of how to manage the boss and which of your fellow 
workersa€™ company you would enjoy at lunch is a valuable source of utility and is something that 
you forgo if you change jobs. And yet elegant theoretical and empirical demonstration of the 
importance of these factors have had very little effect on how many
neoclassical     and neoliberal economist think about the labor market. Perhaps it is because 
sociologists and others tend to phrase these issues in terms of a€cepowera€D. And, for economists, 
a€cepowera€O is a meaningless noisea€”there are only factors that restrict the choice set, and 
exercise of choice within those constraints. Don Corleone in The Godfather does not exercise power. 
He merely makes you an offera€”one that the constraint set, it is true, makes
it   one that you cannot refuse:

Equitable Growth: In Conversation with Jake Rosenfeld'. a€~Equitable Growth Director of Labor 
Market Policy Kate Bahn talks with Jake Rosenfeld, a professor of sociology at Washington 
University in St. Louis, where he studies the causes of economic inequality in the United States 
and other postindustrial economies, particularly the determinants of wages and salaries and how 
these vary across time and place. His most recent
book, Youa€™ re Paid What Youa€™ re Worth and Other Myths of the Modern Economy (Harvard University 
Press, 2021), challenges the idea that workers are paid according to individual performance or 
inherent features of their jobs, and places power and social conflict at the heart of economic 
analysisa€!. How new research surveys show us that much of what we think determines our pay is 
wrong. The role of power in the pay­

4) On our a€~Hexapodiaa€™ podcast, Noah Smith and I wrestle with how to understand Chinaa€™ s 
economic growth trajectory. At the end of it, I try to summarize the key insights:

Noah Smith & Brad DeLong: PODCAST: Hexapodia VIII: The China Syndrome!: Brad DeLong: a€~The key 
insight is that there are five key insights: (1) We need to get Dan Wang on here. (2) When you look 
at China in the coastal East Asian context, it does not look like it has any extra remarkable 
special sauce for market-entrepreneurial and export-oriented growth in its coastal East Asian 
context. (3) Chinese land policy,
specifically the slowdown of the great migration to the coast, appears to have been a substantial 
retardation of what could have been a much more rapid rate of economic growth and catch-up for 
China. (4) Barry Eichengreen is an extremely wise man, and I should pay even more attention to him 
than I do given that he's only three offices away. And (5) isna€™ t there another key insight?a€™ 
Noah Smith: a€~That key insight is clearly

1)Actually, Tyler, no. I do not believe that any a€oeperson operating in good faith can look at the 
evidence and take either side of the argumenta€D on whether or not a $15/hour minimum wage is 
likely to reduce employment by more than one million. I believe that anyone operating in good 
faitha€”who is willing to downright their prior, and assess recent statistical studies without 
strongly motivated reasoninga€”has to wind up much, much closer to
Arindrajit Dubea€™ s beliefs

There is a chunk of the economy in which employers have essentially no market power or ability to 
pick what wages they pay, and in which workers are paid their a€oemarginal productsa€n. There is a 
chunk of the economy in which employers have market power to pick what wages they paya€”via various 
policies of a€oemanaging turnovera€Da€”and in which employers maximize profits by cutting low-wage 
employment below the level at which the
marginal workera€™ s product equals the wage. In the first chunk, an increase in the minimum wage 
reduces employment (but almost surely increases total wages paid to low-wage workers). In the 
second chunk, an increase in the minimum wage moves the low-wage labor market toward its 
competitive equilibrium and so raises employment. We have no good reason to believe that either of 
these sectors is, today, much larger than the other: no good reason to
believe that increases in the minimum wage in the range up to $15/hour will have a big effect 
either way on employment.

Thata€™ s what a good-faith look at the evidence tells us. The claim that the fact that people 
taking a good-faith look at the evidence are not impressed by the CBOa€™ s minimum wage study tells 
us that a€oehypocrisy is bipartisana€D is simply false. As Arindrajit Dube writes 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/24/minimum-wage-economic-research-iob-loss/>: 
CBOa€™ s a€oereport examines only 11 studiesa€!. Its sources include the first
University of Washington study but not the follow-up that came to a more positive conclusiona€! 
changed its formula for summarizing the literature sincea€! 2019a€!. Then, it looked at the 
mediana€!. This time, it placed more weight on those that found large job losses. The 2019 report 
was already somewhat out of step with the latest academic research, but the new one is even more 
soa€!a€D Cherry-picking the studies you look at, and then changing the way
you average them on the flya€”anyone operating in good faith has to be extremely skeptical of any 
such document:

Tyler Cowen: When It Comes to the CBO, the Hypocrisy Is Bipartisan'. a€~Earlier this year the CBO 
said that a federal $15 minimum wage would eliminate 1.4 million jobsa€!. Many academics also did 
not side with the CBO. Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts, a self-described social 
democrat, argued against the CBOinterpretation of the research literature and suggested the loss of 
employment would be much lower.
My own view is closer to that of the CBO. But my larger point is contextual: It is not obvious 
whether Dube or the CBO is right or wrong. A person operating in good faith can look at the 
evidence and take either side of the argumenta€!

2) When the moderate Republicans decided to follow Newt Gingrich in 1993 and go quiet as he led the 
right-wing choir into his version of the crazya€”from Hillary Rodham Clinton as anti-American 
feminist to Bill Clinton as Russian spy to Vince Foster killed to silence Clinton scandalsa€”they 
thought it was a tactical move that would seat them in the chairs of power, afterwhich they could 
bring things back to normal. They failed to recognize that when they
addict their base to the crazy they are always subject to being out-crazied. Some of those who 
followed Gingrich have had second thoughts since: John Kasich, for example. Othersa€”like former 
Speaker John Boehnera€”still have no clue how they pwned themselves, and have come close to 
wrecking the country in the process:

Charles Sykes: Popcorn & Cabernet: a€~Former Speaker John Boehner is out with a new book and, 
apparently, it does not disappoint. Politico has an excerpt: Boehner describes a meeting with Fox 
New boss Roger Ailes. "And it was clear that he believed all of this crazy stuff. I walked out of 
that meeting in a daze. I just didna€™ t believe the entire federal government was so terrified of 
Roger Ailes that theya€™ d break about a

myself talking to the president of the club. One of us was crazy. Maybe it was mea€!. Under the new 
rules of Crazytown, I may have been Speaker, but I didna€™ t hold all the power. By 2013 the chaos 
caucus in the House had built up their own power base thanks to fawning right-wing media and 
outrage-driven fundraising cash. And
now they had a new head lunatic leading the way, who wasna€™ t even a House member. There is 
nothing more dangerous than a reckless asshole who thinks he is smarter than everyone else. Ladies

productivity by a non-trivial amounta€”if we recognize the inadequacies of our statistics:

Arindrajit Dube: Impacts of Minimum Wages: Review of the International Evidence: a€~Overall the

effect of minimum wages on employment, while significantly increasing the earnings of low paid

Therefore, it concludes that, based on the
overall weight of the available evidence, there is room for exploring a more ambitious NLW remit in 
the UK in the coming years, in the range of 60% to two-thirds of median hourly earnings. However, 
given that the evidence base is still developing, it would also be prudent to accompany more 
ambitious minimum wages with a clear mandate that the Low Pay Commission (LPC) can use to 
implement, evaluate and recalibrate any
proposed changes to the NLW, thereby designing in responsiveness to any unforeseen impacts if

6) Here Joshua Gans agrees with me. It is much better for people with things to say to be on

marginal customer. When you sell subscriptions,
that may seem to also hold but it doesna€™ t. Thata€™ s because a subscription is not a payment for 
an individual unit but instead a payment for a bundle. To keep people subscribed to the bundle, 
people have to be attracted to the average rather than the marginal attracting people. That, 
combined with the lack of an intermediary, means that the scale of a substack is much lower and

7) Twittera€™ s failure to properly curb its Nazis, plus its tolerance for people of power and 
influence who violate its terms of servicea€”this has, I think, wrecked the usefulness of the 
platform for society as a whole. Yes, if you prune your feed properly, you can get a great deal out 
of it. But most people wona€™ t use their slow-thinking-brain to do the work. And twitter is 
poisonous if you let your fast-reacting-brain curate your feed. Facebook and Youtube are
worse: too much of their business model involves glueing you to the screen by scaring you so that 
you can be grifted. Now it is SubStacka€™ s turn in the barrel: trying to figure out how to make 
money without, you know, doing evil. We wish them luck:

SubStack: How We Approach Moderation Decisions: a€~We do not allow spam or phishinga€!. We do not 
allow harassment or threatsa€!. This does not include writing about someone unfavorably, even 
repeatedly, but does include threatening violence or explicitly organizing others to do so. We do 
not allow doxxing, defined as the public sharing of private information (such as a home phone 
number or physical address) without their
permission, or threatening to do soa€!. We do not allow hate, defined as publishing content or 
funding initiatives that call for violence, exclusion, or segregation based on protected classesa€! 
based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, age, 
disability, or medical condition. It does not include attacks on ideas, ideologies, organizations, 
or individuals for other reasons, even if those attacks are cruel or
unfair. We do not allow impersonation, though we appreciate a good parody. We do not allow 
plagiarisma€!. We do not allow porn or sexually exploitative contenta€!. Any writer can feel free 
to criticize us, and many have. We will continue to support their right to do so, and they can 
count on the same protection: so long as they havena€™ t broken the rules, we will resist any calls 
that may come for their own deplatforming. We will
always err on the side of respecting writersa€™ right to express themselves and readersa€™ right to 
decide for themselves what to reada€!

8) People should write true things rather than knowingly write false things. And people should 
check what they write to make themselves as sure as they can that they are writing true things. And 
people who make a pattern of writing, knowingly or carelessly, false things should be ignored. 
Sticking to these three principles would make the public sphere much better. Yes, we are looking at 
you, Jude Doyle:

Matt Yglesias: Weekend Update, March 20: a€~Along the way Jude Doyle named me as one of several 
a€oepeople who actively hate trans people and women, argue ceaselessly against our civil rights, 
and in many cases, have a public history of directly, viciously abusing trans people and/or cis 
women in their industry.a€D I objected on Twitter that I do not in fact hate trans people or women, 
nor do I argue against their civil rights even
sporadically, much less ceaselessly. Many people agreed with me, which was nice to see since ita€™ 
s clearly true. Unfortunately, several other people argued that it was fine to write in a public 
forum that I a€oeargue ceaselesslya€D against civil rights for women and trans people on the 
grounds that they find some other thing I did objectionable, or that some other parts of Doylea€™ s 
article are true. I reject this. People should write
true things rather than false thingsa€!
