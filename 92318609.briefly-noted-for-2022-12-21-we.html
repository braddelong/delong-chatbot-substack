However, it is not clear to me what "international factors" mean here. Think of it in this way: there are four things going on in Britain between 1688 and 1815 economically—(a) the creation of the British empire and its engrossment of global long-distance trade, (b) the general growth of the Atlantic, long-distance trade economy, (c) the general growth of the Dover Circle economy of north west, Europe, and (d) things going on within the island of Britain itself. Customs revenues tell us about the first three while excise revenues tell us about the fourth. But what I am really interested in here is the division between the former two and the latter two:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ernesto Dal Bó, Karolina Hutková, Lukas Leucht &amp; Noam Yuchtman: </strong><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30754?utm_campaign=ntwh&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntwg4">Dissecting the Sinews of Power: International Trade and the Rise of Britain’s Fiscal-Military State, 1689-1823</a>: ‘Brewer’s (1989) "Sinews of Power," attributed increased fiscal capacity to the taxation of domestic, rather than traded, goods: excise revenues, coarsely associated with domestic goods, grew faster than customs revenues. We construct new historical revenue series… find substantial growth in taxes on traded goods, accounting for over half of indirect taxation around 1800. This challenges the conventional wisdom attributing the development of the British state to domestic factors: international factors mattered, too…</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>If you realized what was going on in the zero interest rate world before 2022, you recognized that if you could talk fast enough, the willingness of lenders to open their purse would give you near-infinite shots-onpgoal.

The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's country.

I am coming around more and more two of you that social media are the third. Cory Doctorow agrees:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Cory Doctorow</strong>: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/19/better-failure/#let-my-tweeters-go">Better failure for social media</a>: ‘Commercial social media sites don't want to be good, they want to be profitable. The unique dynamics of social media allow the companies to uncouple quality from profit, and more's the pity…. Social media sites who want to keep their users' business walk a fine line: they can simply treat those users well, showing them the things they ask to see, not spying on them, paying to police their service to reduce harassment, etc. But these are costly choices: if you show users the things they ask to see, you can't charge businesses to show them things they don't want to see. If you don't spy on users, you can't sell targeting services to people who want to force them to look at things they're uninterested in. Every moderator you pay to reduce harassment draws a salary at the expense of your shareholders, and every catastrophe that moderator prevents is a catastrophe you can't turn into monetizable attention as gawking users flock to it. So social media sites are always trying to optimize their mistreatment of users, mistreating them (and thus profiting from them) right up to the point where they are ready to switch, but without actually pushing them over the edge…. There's no money in showing people the things they tell you they want to see. If Amazon showed shoppers the products they searched for, they couldn't earn $31b/year on an "ad business" that fills the first six screens of results with rival products who've paid to be displayed over the product you're seeking…</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2022-12-21-we/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2022-12-21-we/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>
