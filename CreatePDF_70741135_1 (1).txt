1. The truest hinge of human history comes in 1870.

2. The true hinge of human history comes not with the 1070 investiture controversy or with 1450 
Gutenberg-and-the-Renaissance, or with the 1700 Commercial-Enlightenment Revolution.

3. The true hinge of human history does not even come with the 1770 steam-and-machinery classic 
industrial revolution.

4. The true hinge of human history comes with the 1870 arrival of the last three pieces of the 
institutional configuration needed to support what Simon Kunznets labeled "modern economic 
growtha€D.

5. Modern economic growth's arrival was the at least 4.5-fold upward jump in the rate of progress 
in technology deployed globallya€”a jump to the 2.1% per year or more rate characteristic of the 
1870-2010 long 20th century.

6. The "at leasta€D and the a€oeor morea€D from the fact that our attempts to calculate real 
incomes are almost always measures of factor cost, while what we really want are measures of user 
benefit. We can guess at a rule-of-thumb: that factor cost and user surplus are of similar orders 
of magnitude for most rival commodities. But we would not expect that rule-of-thumb to hold for 
non-rival commodities. And an increasing share of production is non-rival as technology advances.

7. The first of the three missing pieces of the institutional configuration that arrived in 1870 
was the industrial research laba€”making possible the rationalization and routinization of the 
discovery and development of better technology.

8. The second of the three missing pieces of the institutional configuration that arrived in 1870 
was the modern corporation^’’making possible the rationalization and routinization of the 
development and deployment of better technology.

9. The third of the three missing pieces of the institutional configuration that arrived in 1870 
was full globalizationa€”in communications, in transportation, in migration, and in cultural 
contacta€’’making possible and amping-up the incentives for the global deployment and diffusion of 
better technology.

10. Do not make the mistake of believing that the research lab, the corporation, and full 
globalization were the only or even the most important pieces of the institutional configuration.

11. But without the research lab, the corporation, and full globalization, we get a worldwide rate 
of growth of deployed-and-diffused technology of less than 0.5% per year.

12. With the rule of thumb that 2% more resource scarcity diminishes productivity by as much as 1% 
more technology increases it, a rate of growth of the value of the technology stock 
deployed-and-diffused of 0.5% per year can be neutralized by a population growth rate of 1% per 
yeara€”a doubling only every three generations.

13. Why the rule of thumb that 2% more resource scarcity diminishes productivity by as much as 1% 
more technology increases it? That comes from a production function in which real income per capita 
is technology divided by the square root of population. To claim that real income per capita is 
simply proportional to technology makes the false claim that resource scarcity is not a thing. To 
claim that total global income is proportional to technology makes the false claim that labor is 
not productive. Real income per capita is technology divided by the square root of 
populationa€”that is a middle ground.

14. If the rate of growth of technology is less than 0.5% per yeara€”as it was before 
1870a€’’Malthusian positive and preventative checks swing into play to further limit the long-run 
growth of population.

15. A doubling of population every three generations is something that even a nutritionally 
stressed and poor (but not desperately poor) human population can and does accomplisha€”as long as 
patriarchy drives women to devote great effort to bearing sons.

16. Only a society undergoing modern economic growth can become wealthy enough to loosen patriarchy 
enough for women to possess durable forms of social power other than being the mothers of sons.

17. Thus before the coming of modern economic growth, the rate of technological progress was not 
fast enough to push real incomes high enough to trigger the demographic transition.

18. Before 1870 technology was not able to win its Malthusian race against fertility. That meant a 
very poor world, in which there was no prospect that a sufficiently large economic pie could be 
baked for everyone to have enough.

19. This was even true during the 1770 to 1870 classic industrial revolution century: the likely 
counterfactual scenario in which modern economic growth does not arrive after 1870 is of a very 
poor and semi-permanent steampunk world.

20. Before 1870, therefore, the overwhelming task of governance was that of running a 
force-and-fraud exploitation-and-extraction machine for the benefit of an A©lite, so that it could 
thereby appropriate enough for its members.

21. After 1870, the prospect of baking a sufficiently large economic pie comes into 
viewa€”a€oeeconomic El Doradoa€D, Keynes called it.

22. After 1870, therefore, the possibility arises of governance focused on guiding the creation of 
a truly human world.

23. A truly human world would be one in which there is baked a sufficiently large economic pie that 
is then sliced equitably so that everybody can have enough and that can be properly 
tasteda€’’utilized to offer all of us lives that make us healthy, safe, secure, and happy.

24. Since 1870 we have managed to accomplish the task of baking, a sufficiently large, economic 
piea€”one that is, in fact, vastly in excess of what earlier-century observers would have thought 
required to underpin a true utopia.

25. But the problems of slicing and tastinga€”utilizinga€”our now sufficiently large economic pie 
have flummoxed us.

Construction Physics

Why are there so few economies of scale in construction? Part I

(Note: trying an experiment where I write somewhat shorter posts somewhat more frequently. Any 
feedback is welcome.) Producing goods and services is typically subject to economies of scale - as 
the volume of output rises, the unit cost of each thing being produced falls. Economies of scale 
are common - we dona€™t find it surprising when a large company lika€!
