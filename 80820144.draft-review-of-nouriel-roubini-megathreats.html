I did so looking for some cheer. But I did not find any. The problem is that  Nouriel finds that he can only become optimistic by ceasing to be realistic.</p><p>Nouriel writes:</p><blockquote><p>High-powered economic growth… say, between 5 and 6 percent GDP sustained over time in advanced economies… pay[s] down the debts that threaten us… generates resources that can help us tackle expensive public projects to forestall climate change, aging… tech unemployment… future pandemics. It reduces political tensions and strife. Higher growth is driven to a great extent by technological innovations…. Innovations might create cheap energy in large quantities without emitting greenhouse gases…. I marvel at an accelerating pace of biomedical discoveries…. DeepMind’s AlphaFold… augurs well for accelerating progress against… diseases…. Technology that accelerates growth at a rapid pace is a key ally…</p></blockquote><p>These will not solve all of our problems:</p><blockquote><p>Replacing humans with robots will still tend to increase inequality, culminating in widespread structural tech unemployment. Many people whose jobs vanish will end up earning smaller paychecks for less satisfying work. That has happened to factory workers in the United States and Europe, and their pain is real…</p></blockquote><p>But they will solve many of them. Indeed:</p><blockquote><p>Sluggish growth and inequality spur populism, and populism stirs economic nationalism. Strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth keeps both trends in check…</p></blockquote><p>And such growth would recenter the world and restore to it a unified commitment to extending peace, prosperity, and democracy:</p><blockquote><p>Advanced industrial states and successful emerging markets. Their prosperity will beckon to countries wobbling…. Western values would likely prevail…. A rejuvenated Western system would counteract calls for deglobalization and protectionism…</p></blockquote><p>I think Nouriel is right. This would indeed solve our big problems or reduce them to little problems. This would give us the resources to compensate losers from change, and to deal with all those of our problems that can be solved via resource mobilization. Moreover, the better technology we would gain in the process would make most of our other big problems. solvable as well. 5% per year real national income growth in the global north would indeed be a <em>panacea.</em></p><p>But the prospects for 5% per year real national income growth—through some combination of immigration and productivity growth acceleration—are very dim indeed. In the global north, even moderate rates of immigration trigger forces that lead to perceive immigrants as threats rather than helpers. Global-frontier productivity increase at a rate of more than 2% per year requires institutions that we do not know how to build.</p><p>It is strange. We know that 40 years from now frontier level of global technology will support an economy between 50% and 100% more productive than we are today. So why not set a goal: Do everything we will do over the next 40 years to boost productivity, but do it all in 20 years. Start next January. In January, do whatever you would normally do to boost productivity in January and February, and do so by bringing productivity-boosting activities forward from February into January and pushing activities that do not boost productivity off from January into February. Then repeat. </p><p>Yet nobody believes that anything like this is possible. There are diminishing returns to investment—diminishing returns of all kinds. There are limited capacities for absorption and reconfiguration. There is Fred Brooks’s <em>Mythical Man Month</em>: if you double the number of programmers devoted to a project, you do not halve the time needed to finish, but rather you find that the time needed to finish is significantly greater than if you had just left the situation alone. There needs to be time: time to experiment, observe, reformulate, rejigger, and deploy. And then to experiment again, and restart the cycle.</p><p>But should such diminishing returns be an insurmountable obstacles? Perhaps, when global-frontier productivity growth was 2% per year, democracies were stable, and there were no civilization-shaking, urgent problems like global warming far closer than horizon, we could be satisfied with 2%/year global-frontier technology growth. But now we do not een have that—my forecast is 1% per year. We have global warming that we have not dealt with and need to. And our democracies appear very unstable.</p><p>Some Super-Sputnik-Moment effort seems to be called for—that is the message I get from Nouriel’s book. But what effort? By whom? And how? </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/draft-review-of-nouriel-roubini-megathreats?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/draft-review-of-nouriel-roubini-megathreats?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/draft-review-of-nouriel-roubini-megathreats/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/draft-review-of-nouriel-roubini-megathreats/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p><p></p>
