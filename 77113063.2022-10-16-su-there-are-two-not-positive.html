B. Say, were correct, then those actually taking the risks call the shots and not economists. However, if British Fabian Lord Keynes, who came to prominence only a century ago is correct, then economists in government, think tanks and academe become indispensable to setting policy. </p><p>Look at the laudatory reviews above, and you will see who I am talking about.&nbsp; </p><p>It has been challenging to keep Keynes looking respectable. I believe we are looking at version 3.0 now of rehabilitating his wrongheadedness. Meanwhile, Smith and Say, such ivory tower calumny apart, have held up well. But to read DeLong's "Slouching Towards Utopia," you would think it is not even a close call.&nbsp; </p><p>There is no mention of Keynes' frauds and blunders at the Genoa Conference to put the world back on the gold standard after World War I that led directly to the Great Depression. There is no mention of the "Roosevelt Recession," the third depression of the Great Depression that came as FDR tried to implement industrial policy after receiving his gift copy of Keynes' "The General Theory." There is no mention of the body of academic work that claims Roosevelt needlessly prolonged the Great Depression by at least seven years. There is no mention that FDR's New Deal consisted almost entirely of programs Hoover already had in place—just the opposite. </p><p>There is certainly no mention that Woodrow Wilson was widely credited in Europe as having provided the proof of concept for fascist dirigisme by his takeover of American industry in the first world war.&nbsp; </p><p>In short, I do not buy and read academic economics expecting it to be free of slant, but this book stands as pure snow job with not a nod I could find to any degree of objectivity.</p><ul><li><p>49 people found this helpful</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>Here is the second:</p><blockquote><p>• <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3303VI9YSJQLW/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0465019595">3.0 out of 5 stars :: Gives an economic history, but no new ideas for actually moving towards utopia</a> :: Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2022</p><p> This book provides an economic history with an emphasis on the United States from 1870 to 2010. It is well written and I mostly reading it as an opinionated economic history from an American perspective.&nbsp; </p><p>The title "Slouching Towards Utopia" might lead you to expect more, such as what could be done to improve the economic system or at least define some elements of a desired utopia. The book does little new in that direction.</p><ul><li><p>8 people found this helpful</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>Otherwise, I really cannot complain:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91dc5be3-f994-4212-8c5e-73d0441b3b94_634x710.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91dc5be3-f994-4212-8c5e-73d0441b3b94_634x710.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91dc5be3-f994-4212-8c5e-73d0441b3b94_634x710.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91dc5be3-f994-4212-8c5e-73d0441b3b94_634x710.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91dc5be3-f994-4212-8c5e-73d0441b3b94_634x710.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/91dc5be3-f994-4212-8c5e-73d0441b3b94_634x710.png" width="634" height="710" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/91dc5be3-f994-4212-8c5e-73d0441b3b94_634x710.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:710,&quot;width&quot;:634,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:80897,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91dc5be3-f994-4212-8c5e-73d0441b3b94_634x710.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91dc5be3-f994-4212-8c5e-73d0441b3b94_634x710.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91dc5be3-f994-4212-8c5e-73d0441b3b94_634x710.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91dc5be3-f994-4212-8c5e-73d0441b3b94_634x710.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><p></p><p>One Video:</p><div id="youtube2-FEZPCme8WZY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;FEZPCme8WZY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FEZPCme8WZY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div>
