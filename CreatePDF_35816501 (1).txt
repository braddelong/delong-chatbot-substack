A 33.4% annualized U.S. GDP growth rate for the third quarter of 2020; a 4.3% growth rate for the 
fourth quarter; a 6.4% rate for the first quarter of 2021; and we are now a...“ of the way through 
the second quartera€’’which means that a...” of the economic transactions that will be aggregated 
into the second-quarter growth rate have already happened, even though we do not yet have a read on 
thema€”in which the growth rate will be at least 8% and perhaps
significantly higher. That means that by the third quartera€”the fourth quarter at the latesta€”the 
U.S. economy will, in aggregate, have fully recovered its production level from the coronavirus 
plague recession.

And we already have, this past month in the U.S., core inflation of 0.4%-points: nearly a 5% annual 
inflation rate if this pace were to continue for the next year. Looking backwards, over the past 12 
months core inflation has been 2.3% as measured by the CPIa€”only a whisker below the Federal 
Reservea€™ s 2.0%/2.5% PCE/CPI target.

Yes: We are going to have some inflation this year. Its most important determinant, however, is not 
a€ceoverheatinga€O in the economy as a whole. The amount by which production is going to exceed the 
level of potential output in the U.S. economy for year 2021 as a whole will be less than zero. And, 
as the Federal Reserve makes clear with every press conference and statement, it will not allow any 
wage-price spiral to embed itself in expectations of future
inflation. The outlook for 2021 and beyond is that inflation will bounce arounda€”not, as it has 
for the past thirteen years, average belowa€”the Federal Reservea€™ s targets.

The U.S. economy is emerging from the coronavirus plague year recession with a very different 
intersectoral structural balance than it had back in 2019. Durable goods spending right now is 
running at 1.7%-points of GDP above its 2019 share. Housing construction spending right now is 
running at 0.5%-points above its 2019 share. On the flip side, business spending on structures and 
consumer spending on energy are both running at 0.5%-points below their
2019 shares. And servicesa€’’hospitality, recreation, and transportation^’’are collectively running 
at 2.2%-points below their 2019 share.

That is going to be the most important determinant of inflation this year. By the end of this year 
we will have an economy that will have perhaps 4% of workers not just in different jobs but in 
different sectors than they were before the coronavirus plague struck. We have an economy in which 
business very rarely cut nominal wages. That means that to pull workers out of sectors in which 
demand is relatively slack into those in which demand is intense will
require firms to offer wage increases to incentivize workers to move sectors.

How much inflation? We do not know: we have not seen this happen before. We will learn a lot about 
the short-run intersectoral elasticity of employment supply this year.

Should we be upset at this inflation this year? No. It is an essential part of rebalancing the 
economy. Real production, real wages, and real asset values will all be higher because of this 
yeara€™ s inflation. And it will still leave the price level far below what it would have been had 
the Federal Reserve managed to successfully hit its inflation targets since the start of the Great 
Recession.
Are the 1970s coming again? Highly, highly unlikely. It required a perfect storm of shocks, and a 
Federal Reserve under Arthur Burns that was greatly conflicted and confused, to generate the 1970s. 
The Federal Reserve is very different now. And the perfect storm of repeated shocksa€”from the 
productivity growth slowdown to the Iranian Revolution and much, much morea€”is absent.
You cannot rejoin the highway at speed without leaving rubber tracks on the road. But that does not 
mean you have had a blowout.
