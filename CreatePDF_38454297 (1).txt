Zach Carter:The End of Friedmanomics 
<https://newrepublic.com/article/162623/milton-friedman-legacv-biden-government-spending>:

When he arrived in South Africa on March 20,1976, Milton Friedman was a bona fide celebritya€!. 
Friedman was a bestselling author and no stranger to fine living. But he was astonished by both 
a€oethe extraordinary affluence of the White communitya€D and the a€oeextraordinary inequality of 
wealtha€D in South Africa.
Friedman was not a man to scold opulence, and yet he found the tension permeating apartheid South 
Africa palpable in both taxicabs and hotel ballrooms. The a€oehardboiled attitudesa€D of Mobil 
chairman Bill Beck and his friends were difficult for him to endurea€!.

All of which makes a contemporary reading of Friedmana€™ s Cape Town lecturesa€! harrowing.a€! His 
first speech was an unremitting diatribe against political democracy.a€! Voting, Friedman declared, 
was inescapably corrupt, a distorted a€cemarketa€D in which a€oespecial interestsa€D inevitably 
dictated the course
of public life. Most voters were a€oeill-informed.a€n Voting was a a€oehighly weighteda€D process 
that created the illusion of social cooperation that whitewashed a reality of a€oecoercion and 
force.a€D True democracy, Friedman insisted, was to be found not through the franchise, but the 
free market, where consumers
could express their preferences with their unencumbered wallets. South Africa, he warned, should 
avoid the example of the United States, which since 1929 had allowed political democracy to 
steadily encroach on the domain of the a€oeeconomic market,a€D resulting in a€oea drastic 
restriction in economic, personal, and
political freedom.a€Da€!

Friedman did not subscribe to biological theories of racial inferiority.a€! The program Friedman 
prescribed for apartheid South Africa in 1976 was essentially the same agenda he called for in 
America over his entire career as a public intellectuala€’’unrestrained commerce as a cure-all for 
inequality and unrest.

That this prescription found political purchase with the American right in the 1960s is not a 
surprise. Friedmana€™ s opposition to state power during an era of liberal reform offered 
conservatives an intellectual justification to defend the old order. What remains remarkable is the 
extent to which the Democratic Partya€”
Friedmana€™ s lifelong political adversarya€’’came to embrace core tenets of Friedmanism. When 
Friedman passed away in 2006, Larry Summers, who had advised Bill Clinton and would soon do the 
same for Barack Obama, acknowledged the success of Friedmana€™ s attack on the very legitimacy of 
public power within
his                                                                                                 
                                                  own party. a€oeAny honest Democrat will admit 
that we are now all Friedmanites,a€D he declared in The New York Times.

No longer. In the early months of his presidency, Joe Biden has pursued policy ambitions unseen 
from American leaders since the 1960s. If implemented, the agenda he described in an April 28 
address to Congress would transform the countrya€’’slashing poverty, assuaging inequality, reviving 
the infrastructure that supports
daily economic life, and relieving the financial strains that childcare and medical care put on 
families everywhere. It will cost a lot of money, and so far at least, Biden isna€™t letting the 
price tag intimidate him. a€oel want to change the paradigm,a€D he repeated three times at a press 
conference in Marcha€!

Zach Carter: The Price of Peace: Money, Democracy, & the Life of John Maynard Keynes <https: 
//www.zacharydcarter.com>:

The school of thought that has come to be associated with the name of Keynes no longer has much to 
do with the moral and political ideals Keynes himself prized. Keynesianism in this broader sense 
was for a time synonymous with liberal internationalism^’’the idea that shrewd, humane economic 
management could protect
democracies from the siren songs of authoritarian demagogues and spread peace and prosperity around 
the globea€!.

The key to realizing that international vision was domestic economic policy making. International 
political stability would be achieveda€”or at least encourageda€”by alleviating domestic economic 
inequality. State spending on public works and public health could be combined with redistributive 
taxation to boost consumer
demand, while establishing an environment in which great art could thrive. In his maturity, Keynes 
offered radicals a deal: They could realize the cultural and moral aims of liberationist 
revolution^ ”a more equal society and a democratically accountable political leaderships’’while 
avoiding the risks and tragedies inherent to
violent conflict. He claimed that the social order established by nineteenth-century imperialism 
and nineteenth-century capitalism was not so rigid that it could not be reformed rather than 
overthrown.

After nearly a century on trial, this Keynesianism has not embarrassed itself, but neither has it 
been vindicated. The New Deal, the Beveridge Plan, and the Great Society fundamentally reordered 
British and American life, making both societies more equal, more democratic, and more prosperous. 
In the 1930s, black poverty in
the United States was so high that nobody bothered to measure it. By the 1950s, it was over 50 
percent. Today it is about 20 percent. This is progress. But it is decidedly not the world promised 
by the Communist Party in the 1930s, when it denounced Franklin Delano Roosevelt as a tool of the 
business elite. It cannot compete
with the dreams of liberation presented by Black Power revolutionaries of the 1960sa€!.

Keynesians can persuasively argue that todaya€™ s tragedies are the product of a failure to fully 
implement Keynesian ideas rather than a failure of Keynesian policiesa€!. For the past thirty-five 
years, the United States and Great Britain have mixed Keynesian disaster managementa€’’bailouts and 
stimulus programsa€”with
the aristocratic deregulatory agenda of Hayekian neoliberalism.

It is appropriate for neoliberalism to take most of the blame for the political upheavals of the 
twenty-first century. The neoliberal faith in the power of financial markets bequeathed us the 
financial crisis of 2008, and the fallout from that disaster has fueled dozens of hateful movements 
around the world. While the American
commitment to Keynesian stimulus after the crash was inconstant, Keynesian ideas were simply 
abandoned throughout most of Europea€!. The economic ruina€! has energized neofascist political 
parties, which now threaten the political establishment^!. But pointing the finger at neoliberalism 
raises uncomfortable questions
for  Keynes and his defenders. Why has Keynesianism proven to be so politically weak, even among 
ostensibly liberal political parties and nations? The Keynesian bargain of peace, equality, and 
prosperity ought to be irresistible in a democracy. It has instead been fleeting and fragile. 
Keynes believed that democracies slipped
into tyranny when they were denied economic sustenance. Why, then, have so many democracies elected 
to deny themselves economic sustenance?a€!

This is a dark time for democracya€”a statement that would have been unthinkable to U.S. and 
European leaders only a few short years ago. It took decades of mismanagement and unlearning to 
manufacture this global crisis, and it cannot be undone with a few new laws or elections.
