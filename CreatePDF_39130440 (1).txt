Scott Lemieux: The Tucker/Berenson Corridor, & the Blue State Holdouts: a€~The COVID surge is of 
course concentrated heavily among the unvaccinateda€”the vaccines are extremely effective !a€’’and 
so ita€™ s not surprising which states are seeing the worst numbersa€!. Still, blue states cana€™ t 
be entirely complacent: Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia have adjusted rates below 
the national average. In the region, however, lower
vaccination rates in the Black community have concentrated cases there to an extraordinary degree. 
Before vaccines, Black people represented about one-third of new coronavirus cases in Maryland and 
half in D.C. In the latest data, Black people represent just under half of the new cases in 
Maryland and more than 80 percent in D.C. In jurisdictions where ita€™ s politically viable, we 
need more vaccine mandates and more positive incentives to take the
vaccines. Solving the problem of MAGA non-vaccination is harder but therea€™ s still plenty of 
lower-hanging fruit out there in absolute numbersa€!

Joe Studwell: How Asia Works: Success & Failure in the Worlda€™ s Most Dynamic Region: a€™ A rather 
typical landlord of the era was Deng Wenming, father of future Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who 
owned ten hectares in Paifang village in the hinterland of Chongqing in Sichuan province. Deng 
Wenming lived in a 22-room house on the edge of his village and leased out two-thirds of his 
fields. He, like so many other landlords, was not a man of
limitless wealth. But he controlled the land of more than half a dozen average familiesa€!

Paul Krugman: What Inflation Risks & My Intermittent Fasting Have in Common: a€~This creates a 
situation very different from the one that prevailed after World War II. Then, people rushed to buy 
the cars and home appliances they had been prevented from buying under rationinga€!. There really 
was a lot of pent-up demand. But you cana€™ t suddenly eat all the restaurant meals you didna€™ t 
get to eat during lockdown; people will probably spend a few
months dining out more than usual, and they may engage in some revenge vacation and travel. But 
therea€™ s a limit to how much of that you can doa€”just as therea€™ s a limit to how much you can 
stuff yourself after a fast daya€l. So my guess is that therea€™ s less to those huge excess 
savings numbers and big stimulus numbers than meets the eye. Overheating is still possible, and the 
Fed should keep its eye on that possibility. But the big numbers
arena€™t as scary as they seema€!

Matthew Yglesias: Thirteen ways of Looking at a Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal: a€~A clear path to 
a successful 117th Congress is emerging: A bipartisan group of senatorsa€! agreed yesterday on a 
broad framework for an infrastructure billa€l. A lot is being made of progressive sour grapes about 
how they dona€™ t want to agree to this deal unless they are guaranteed a later reconciliation 
package with more partisan ideas. I think the real linkage goes the
other waya€”Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema (and quietly the dozen other senate Dems who kinda agree 
with them) now get to say that bipartisan legislating is happening, and ita€™ s happening thanks to 
them. They are now open to a reconciliation bill on its own termsa€!. This whole thing could still 
fall apart! The painstaking negotiations were driven by the perceived political needs of moderate 
Senate Democrats, who wanted to make a deal with Senate
Republicans. But Democratsa€™ House majority is very thin and ita€™ s not clear that bipartisanship 
in the Senate will carry over into votes from House Republicans. I dona€™ t think anyone on either 
side of the aisle in the House is thrilled about having been cut out of these talks. Watch what 
happens there!

Noah Smith: Who Can Push Back When Wokeness Overreaches?: a€~There were reasons that wokeness 
emerged when it did; it was not an external imposition or a communist infiltration or any of the 
other nefarious plots its inveterate opponents accuse it of beinga€!. By the early 2010s, America 
had become a country where the general social respect afforded to minorities of all kinds was out 
of step with the countrya€™ s increasing diversity and material
equality. Wokeness, I posited, arose as a leveling movement for the upper rungs of Maslowa€™ s 
Hierarchya€”a sort of socialism of respect. In the second post, I drew a connection between 
wokeness and Protestant Christianity, especially the Congregationalist abolitionism of the early 
1800sa€!. Wokeness is a fundamental, recurrent part of the American nationa€!. In other words, I 
believe that wokeness was a thing whose time had comea€!. has done a

with me about this. But like many movementsa€! overreach[ing]a€!. A few examples of places where I

cultureaC™ stuff when X is something good like a€~punctualitya€™ . If something else is meant, then 
it would be good to say that clearly insteada€!. In 2015, a group of protesters protested an 
exhibit at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts that encouraged attendeesa€”of all racesa€”to wear 
kimonos. The protesters, who were themselves mostly (maybe entirely?)
non-Japanese, alleged that this was a form of White appropriation of Asian culture. They were 
promptly opposed by a group of counter-protesters: the Japanese women who made and sold the kimonos 
to the attendees! In other words, non-Japanese American protesters had appropriated kimono culture 
for themselves and threatened to deprive Japanese people of their livelihood selling their 
countrya€™ s cultural productsa€!. The college cafeteria firingaCI Smith
Collegea€! a cafeteria worker who was threatened with firing for informing a Black student that she 
wasna€™ t allowed to eat in a space that had been reserved for young children. Later, a janitor 
called security to talk to the student, following a procedure forbidding janitorial staff from 
interacting with students on their own. Accusations of racism erupted, and the university 
apologized, even though its own investigation found that both employees were following

procedures correctly and were not motivated by racisma€!. Ideological overreach does need to be 
pushed back against, otherwise it can grow into a serious problem. The question is: Who in America 
has the moral standing to push back?a€!

Lant Pritchett: National Development Delivers: & How! & How?: a€™ Core dual ideas of early 
development economics and practice were that (a) national development was a four-fold 
transformation of countries towards: (i) a more productive economy, (ii) a more responsive state, 
(iii) more capable administration, and (iv) a shared identity and equal treatment of citizens and 
(b) this four-fold transformation of national development would lead to higher levels
of human wellbeinga€!. Idea [(b)] is strikingly correct: development deliversa€!. How national 
development deliversa€! variesa€!. Economic growth is much more important for achieving wellbeing 
at low versus high levels of incomea€! matters more for a€oebasic needsa€D than for other 
dimensions of wellbeing (like social inclusiveness or environmental quality)a€! [and] state 
capability matters more for wellbeing outcomes that depend on public
production than on private goodsa€!. These findings may seem too common sense to be worth a paper,
