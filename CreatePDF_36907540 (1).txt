First:

Butd! butd! butd! If it escapes from the lab, it escapes into people working at the lab who then 
have lots of close indoor contact with others working at the lab. Thus the first

sign we see of the disease is a huge cluster among lab workers. Did we see such a cluster? No. We 
see no antibodies in lab workers. We see three lab workers catching what look to
be bad cases of the flu in November 2019, and then no radiation until we get the superspreader 
event at the market:

Aylin Woodward: Lab Leak vs. Animal Spillover: Evidence for Coronavirus Origin Theories: d~The WIV 
staff said they found no evidence that samples
of the new coronavirus had been stored at the instituted!. Records reviewed by WHO did not indicate 
that any viruses closely related to the new
coronavirus were kept in any Chinese labd!. [But] the WHO team spent just hours at the 
instituted’’which isnd™ t enough time to pore over files,
databases,   or freezer inventories. The instituted™ s staff also did not share all of its records 
or safety logsd!. Shi Zhenglid! doeis absolutely positive
that   she had never identified this virus prior to the outbreak happening ,dO Mazet told 
Insiderd!. Three WIV staff members got sick and went to a
hospital more than a month before experts identified the first COVIDd“19 cases in Wuhand! [with] 
symptomsd! doeconsistent with both
COVIDd“19   and common seasonal illnessdDd! blood samples taken from WIV staff in the months ahead 
of the pandemic all tested negative for
coronavirus antibodiesd!. Fauci saidd! itd™ s more likely that the coronavirus got good at jumping 
between people while spreading doebelow the
radardD   in China in late 2019d! spreading for several weeks, if not months, before the first 
cases were reported. That allowed the virus doeto be pretty
well adapted when first recognized,dD Fauci saidd!

Plus:

No, we should not be studying dangerous viruses in labs in the middle of large cities. With nuclear 
weapons, there is a reason we built Lawrence Livermore lab very far indeed from
the university in Berkeley that initially staffed it. We should treat contagious deadly viruses the 
same way. We should do this whether the lab-leak story is true or false. We should
do this if we conclude that there is a 10% chance, a 1% chance, an 0.01% chance, or a 0% chance 
that the lab-leak story is true.

But we should not doeact as though the [lab leak] story is truedD. This subhead from the Atlantic 
is highly, highly unprofessional:

Daniel Engber: If the Lab-Leak Theory Is Right, Whata€™ s Next?: d~We know enough to acknowledge 
that the scenario is possible, and we should
therefore act as though itd™ s trued!

Paragraphs:

I want more backing for this. I guess I have to go read Craig Freedman 
<https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-l-137-58974-3_5> to find it:

Paul Romer: Stigler Conviction: d~The Great Depression was a traumatic experience ford! Stiglerd!. 
Stigler wanted halt to progress in economic
theory because he feared that it would lead to more theories like those of Keynes and Chamberlin 
(who provided the foundation for Dixit and Stiglitz). For
him, there was apparently too much risk that such theories might lend political support for 
government policies that should not be tried. Under his division
of labor with Milton Friedman, Friedman took on Keynes and Stigler took on Chamberlin. Marshall, 
they agreed, was safe. They turned Chicago in the last
bastion of opposition to the Samuelson program and thereby prolonged for decades the confusion that 
Marshall had spawnedd!

Did Truman not submit this because the GATT process was already underway, seemed to be working, and 
he had more than enough on his plate with the Korean War and the
implementation of NSC-68? Or was Trumand™ s decision not to submit the Havana Charter treaty to the 
senate a significant policy shift? I ought to know this. I do not:

Wikipedia: International Trade Organization: d~Led by the United States in collaboration with 
allies, the effort to form the organization from 1945 to
1948, with the successful passing of the Havana Charter, eventually failed due to lack of approval 
by the US Congress. Until the creation of the World
Trade Organization in 1995, international trade was managed through the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT)d!

Even Levittd™ s papers have doereplication problemsdnd”which is no biggie: that is why we check 
each other, so that we can get enthusiastic when we think we find
something. But Andrewd™ s definition of the general freakonomics franchise as contrarian bulls—: 
doeeverything you thought was right, was wrong. Drunk walking is worse
than                                                                            drunk driving, 
global cooling rather than global warming, etedidd is correct. And assessing it as doepromoting the 
work of Levittd™ s friends and various randos on the
internetdD is also correct:

Andrew Gellman: Thinking Fast, Slow, & Not at All: System 3 Humps the Shark: d~The chain of 
trusta€!. We discussed this general issue a few years
ago in the context of the unstable mix of skepticism and trust that was characteristic of the 
Freakonomics franchise. The skepticism came because one of

the main themes of Freakonomics was how everything you thought was right, was wrong. Drunk walking 
is worse than drunk driving, global cooling rather
than global warming, etc. The trust came because, after their first book, which was mostly based on 
author Levittd™ s research, the Freakonomics
franchise pretty much ran out of original research and was reduce to promoting the work of Levittd™ 
s friends and various randos on the internetd!
