Better than ever…. The ‘Foundation’ novels are about society, not gadgets…. The absence of conventional cliffhangers doesn’t mean an absence of unconventional cliffhangers…. Here’s the trick: after the fact, it becomes clear that bravery and cunning had nothing to do with it, because the Foundation was fated to win thanks to the laws of psychohistory…. The warlord’s weapons were no match for the Foundation’s economic clout. And so on. This unique plot structure creates an ironic resonance between the ‘Foundation’ novels and… prophetic fantasy… a tale of prophecy fulfilled… a very bourgeois version of prophecy…. The ‘Foundation’ novels are… about the true final frontier—understanding ourselves, and the societies we make…. What do I think of Asimov’s belief that we… can develop a social science?… I’ve been struck… by just how much power good economics has to make correct predictions that are very much at odds with popular prejudices and ‘common sense’…. It’s a long way from getting the medium-term path of interest rates and inflation more or less right to predicting the overall course of civilization…. Asimov’s psychohistory evidently integrates economics with political science and sociology, which are much harder sub- jects than economics—economics is, after all, largely about greed, while other social sciences have to deal with more complex emotions…. The ‘Foundation’ novels… remain, uniquely, a thrilling tale about how self-knowledge—an understanding of how our own society work—can change history for the better… every bit as inspirational now as they were when I first read them, three-quarters of my life ago…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190918085648/https://webspace.princeton.edu/users/pkrugman/FDT%20intro.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20190918085648/https://webspace.princeton.edu/users/pkrugman/FDT%20intro.pdf</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-2021-10-30-sa?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-2021-10-30-sa?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Michelle Holder &amp; Lisa Cook</strong>: <em>Child Care &amp; the Economy</em>: ‘A clip from… In Conversation at Equitable Growth 2021: Evidence for a Stronger Economic Future… &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1nIS_mwy20">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1nIS_mwy20</a>&gt;:</p><div id="youtube2-W1nIS_mwy20" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;W1nIS_mwy20&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W1nIS_mwy20?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Erik Anderson</strong>: <em>California Condors Reproduce Without a Male.

Schumpeter believed that capitalism would become the ultimate victim of its own success, inspiring reactionary and populist movements against its destructive side that would inadvertently strangle any potential for future creativity….

But as late as 1650, Britain was neither the world’s richest nor most energy-intensive economy. That honor fell to the Netherlands…. Peat forms when plant matter, usually in marshy areas, fails to fully decay because of a lack of oxygen. It’s sort of an intermediate stage on the road to coal formation, and is really only semi-renewable—it takes 1000 years to form one meter, provided that you leave it undisturbed. The energy density of peat is equivalent to that of wood—15–17 MJ per kg—though lower than coal (24 MJ/kg) or charcoal (29 MJ/kg).

They haven’t quite severed ties with Eastman but clearly don’t want him to be their public face. The relationship between the Federalist Society and Eastman parallels how establishment Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell treated Donald Trump after the January 6 riot. McConnell refused to support the impeachment and sanctioning of Trump and just wished the former president, as well as the embarrassment Trump has brought to the Republican party, would simply go away. The political calculation is that it is too damaging to either embrace Trump (and thus alienate many moderate voters) or to condemn him (thus alienating the right-wing base). Similarly, if the Federalist Society were to make explicit that Eastman is no longer welcome, they would alienate many of their own members and donors (who might, in fact, agree with Eastman). If they continued to host events with Eastman, the Federalist Society would lose their status as a respectable mainstream institution that can be trusted to provide advice to the Republican party.&nbsp;Like McConnell, the Federalist Society has worked out a dodge, a way to whistle past the graveyard of a failed insurrection in the hopes that no ghosts will be revived.
