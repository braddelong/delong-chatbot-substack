No. I do not think that this laptop is happy running both mmhmm and zoom at the same time. Why do 
you ask?:

John Holbo: Dead Right: a€~Fruma€™ s conception of liberals as unhappy until therea€™ s a paroled 
murderer and UN bluehelmet on every cornera€”is subject to doubt. But we pass over in silence; the 
man, to his credit, does not mince words about the faults of his partya€!. I was genuinely curious 
what Frum thinks conservatism looks like in all its glorious and unalloyed philosophical ideal 
purity, scoured clean and
purified of blemishes, flaws, errors, compromises, distortions due to human weakness, money, K 
Street, the usual suspectsa€!. [When] I went on a multi-post tear into the NROa€! what impressed me 
then was the lack of discernable political philosophy. To adapt the great conservative Carlyle: 
seldom have I seen someone execute such a shallow dive into such deep water and emerge so muddy.

Little sense of how complicated the brain is, and how well it has been taught by evolution:

Duncan Black: Eschaton: If Only Theya€™ d Listened To Atrios: a€~And paid me lots of money for the 
very fine advice that I gave away for free on this very fine blog: a€oeThe wizards of Silicon 
Valley said people would be commuting to work in self-driving cars by now. Instead, there have been 
court fights, injuries and deaths, and tens of billions of dollars spent on a frustratingly fickle 
technologya€! still years from
becoming the industrya€™ s next big thinga€!. Uber and Lyft, worried about blowing through their 
casha€! have tapped out. Only the most deep pocketed outfits like Waymoa€! auto industry giants, 
and a handful of start-ups area€!in the game.a€D a€ceWizardsa€Da€!

IIRC, Solowa€™ s contempt was always more than returned by Lucasa€™ s venom. It was in 1980, after 
all, that Lucas wrote: aCcePeople even take offense if being referred to as a€~Keynesiansa€™ . At 
research seminars, people dona€™t take Keynesian theorizing seriously anymore. The audience starts 
to whisper and giggle to one anothera€!a€D

<https://web.archive.Org/web/20070610024139/https://www.iisec.ucb.edu.bo/amercado/clases/macroeconom
ia maestria/lecturas/The reincarnation of keynesian economics.pdf>.

A curious thing is that this was written by Lucas a year and a half after what he characterized as 
a€oethe beginning of the end for my attempts to account for the business cycle in terms of monetary 
shocksa€D.

I confess it is one thing to form a a€oesub-culturea€! more likea€! a platoon on the battlefielda€! 
[with] loyalty and group cohesiona€! priority, so models that were illogical or inconsistent with 
the evidence went unchallengeda€!a€D for an intellectual position you believe in. It is quite 
another for a position that you see as badly underwater and gambling for resurrection:

Paul Romer: What Went Wrong in Macroa€”Historical Details: a€™ Solow was harshly critical of the 
new classical macro models pioneered by Robert Lucas, dismissive in a way that seemed to me to 
skirt uncomfortably close to contempta€! concerned that the type of model Lucas was developing 
might undermine political support for active countercyclical policy. To his credit, there was a 
legitimate basis for this concern.
The new Chicago school of macro eventually did oppose an active response to the financial crisis 
and its aftermath. But the type of response that Solow exemplified may actually have contributed to 
the emergence of this new Chicago schoola€!. Tak[ing] seriously what the rebel group that was 
forming around Lucas was sayinga€! might have kept the rebels from cutting off contact with all 
outsiders, even those who were
taking seriously the issues they were raising. Once they cut off contact with the outside, these 
rebels developed a sub-culture that was more like what youa€™ d expect to find among members of a 
platoon on the battlefield than among scientists parsing logic and weighing evidence. Loyalty and 
group cohesion took priority, so models that were illogical or inconsistent with the evidence went 
unchallenged. These values might
have developed in any department, but they found support and encouragement at the University of 
Chicago, which was already committed to Stigler conviction instead of Feynman integritya€!

This is really creepy;

McKinley Valentinie: The Polywater Fiasco: a€~Strongest memories are points of disillusionment, 
because theya€™ re turning points in how you view the worlda€!. The first time I felt true 
disillusionment was when I found out that caterpillars dona€™ t go into cocoons and grow wings; 
they go into cocoons, release digestive enzymes, dissolve into soup, and then grow into butterflies 
from stem cells. It really puts a different
spin on all those butterfly/transformation/coming-of-age metaphorsa€!

Botswana is worth more attention. But a€oeproperty rights!a€D and a€oeorthodox economic 
policies!a€D is not, IMHO, sufficient:

Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, & James A. Robinson: An African Success Story: Botswana: a€~Botswana 
has had the highest rate of per-capita growtha€! in the worlda€! despite adverse initial 
conditionsa€! minimal investment during the colonial perioda€! high inequality. Botswanaa€! 
follow[ed] orthodox economic policiesa€! [but] typically in Africa, a€oegood economicsa€D has 
proved not to be politically
feasiblea€!. We conjecture that the following factors were importanta€!. Effect[s] of British 
colonialism on Botswana was minimala€!. Following independence, maintaining and strengthening 
institutions of private property were in the economic interests of the elitea€!. Botswana is very 
rich in diamondsa€! rentsa€l [so] no group wanted to challenge the status quo at the expense of 
a€oerocking the boata€Da€! critical
decisions made bya€!. Khama and Masirea€!

Can scale and apps built on top of platforms a step behind and not quite cutting-edge systems come 
to dominate? Perhaps:

Nicolas Colin: Chinaa€™ s Industry Policy wl Emily de La BruyA 're: a€~[On] Jordan Schneidera€™ s 
ChinaTalk podcasta€! the key idea a€!. "What matters today is the applications of science and 
technologya€“a€“the sort of networks you build with ita€! capturing scale and being able to build 
and deploya€!. [Then] ita€™ s okay to have a slight lag in when you get the patent and when you get 
the really cutting edge, as
long as you can apply it to scalea€!. The Chinese orientation appears to be focusing on that rather 
than on basic R&D, which creates this tremendous asymmetry vis-A -vis the U.S. and really vis-A 
-vis the entire global system because therea€™ s just a different competition underwaya€!. Ita€™ s 
not a matter of just pouring resources into basic research: ita€™ s about competing for 
applicationsa€!
