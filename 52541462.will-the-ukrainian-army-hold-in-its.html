Beyond tactical assessments, there are two primary reasons I’ve said Ukraine would win this fight. Here’s… why…. Reason 1: Conventional joint and combined arms operations are hard. Real hard. Exceedingly hard…. Doing so takes intense training of individuals in their specific skills, exercises that build the capabilities of interprofessional teams who pull those skills together, the understanding of complex equipment &amp; doctrine, communicating intent…and great leadership…. All this takes time, determination, and repetitious training… develops develops teamwork, trust, loyalty, and camaraderie. Good militaries understand all this, and good military leaders ensure it happens…. Less-than-good militaries put conscripts under arms, field equipment with inherent faults, and allow corruption…. The second reason I’ve been bold is because I had the chance to see how seemingly small things contribute to big failure…. I was assigned as the Commander of the Operations Group… at our Army’s National Training Center… fight[ing] mock battles against a tough opposing force for a couple of weeks…. Good units polish their good things, fix their bad things, and the battle resumes. After three weeks units and their leaders are darned good. Not-so-good units don’t accept critiques, don’t fix broken processes, repeatedly allow small issues to turn into big problems, and don’t reflect on their own leadership failures…. A few years after serving at the NTC, and after a combat tour, I was assigned as a new Brigadier General to command the Army’s European training center at Grafenwoehr Germany…. U[kraine ]A[rmy] trained there &amp; soon had their own training center at Yavoriv…. The few times I observed the R[ussian] army in training and exercises, or talked to their leaders, they didn’t seem to be “good units.” Comparing the 2 armies-even w/ seemingly different quantity of equipment-the expectations seemed obvious…. I’ll again be bold in saying Ukraine will persevere. I hope that isn’t seen as hubris, it’s just an assessment based on my bias about who will best face the challenges of combined arms warfare &amp; which is the learning Army…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/MarkHertling/status/1518604757149143040&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;A few folks suggested I've been \&quot;bold\&quot; in some of my predictions accompanying the analysis I've provided on <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@CNN</span> regarding this conflict.\n\nBeyond tactical assessments, there are 2 primary reasons I've said Ukraine would win this fight.\n\nHere's a short 🧵 on why I say this.  1/17&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;MarkHertling&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mark Hertling&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Mon Apr 25 14:56:03 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:2155,&quot;like_count&quot;:9479,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/MarkHertling/status/1518604757149143040" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/MarkHertling.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @MarkHertling"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">Mark Hertling </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@MarkHertling</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">A few folks suggested I've been "bold" in some of my predictions accompanying the analysis I've provided on <span class="tweet-fake-link">@CNN</span> regarding this conflict.

For most of history, a commander with <em><strong>assibayah</strong></em><strong> </strong>handled logistics, inspiration, and delivered soldiers to the right battlefield; and soldiers with <em><strong>assibayah</strong></em><strong> </strong>knew how to handle their weapons while protecting those standing next to them. And with <em><strong>assibayah</strong></em>, soldiers supplied who trusted their leader and found themselves on the right battlefield were nearly invincible. F——— phalanx. F——— legion. F——— knights. F——— longbowmen. F——— pikemen. And, above all (usually), f——— horse-archers.</p><p>But then, with the coming of personal firearms, it all became more complicated. It turned into rock → paper → scissors. Cavalry rode down musketeers. Musketeers rolled over pikemen. Pikemen drove off cavalry. And artillery was a joker that could break up the pike phalanx and disorder the other arms to render them combat ineffective—unless and until it was itself overrun. Tactical victory required combined arms, and the right kind of combined arms, so that their cavalry faced your pikemen, their pikemen faced your musketeers, and their musketeers were ridden down by your cavalry. As time passed, things became more complex.</p><p>And in all of this, (fewer) professionals could easily defeat (more) amateurs. And professionals could be defeated by better professionals who understood the principles of combined-arms warfare better. How is it that Arthur Wellesley could win at, consecutively, Roliça, Vimeiro, Oporto, Talavera, Buçaco, Fuentes de Onoro, Salamanca, Vitoria, the Pyrenees, Bidassoa, Nivelle, Toulouse, and Waterloo? (Note, however, that his siege efforts were often unsuccessful.) As von Clausewitz wrote: “war is very simple, but the simplest thing is very difficult”.</p><p>How much does the Ukrainian Army really know what it is doing? And how much of that knowledge can be transmitted quickly to replacements? We can hope.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The best single thing I have read on all of this is: <strong>Daniel P.

It concludes: “We consider the story of Iraq’s weapons, and of the pattern of misinformation, to be unfinished business. And we fully intend to continue aggressive reporting aimed at setting the record straight.” That seems to have been an unkept promise. And not-keeping this promise has led to a New York Times that for four years assured me, several times a week, that Jared and Ivanka were horrified and were working diligently to save us all:</p><blockquote><p><strong>James Fallows</strong>: <em>Two New Possibilities for the ‘Times’</em>: ‘In May, 2004, barely a year after the U.S. invaded Iraq, the paper ran a major editorial-page statement titled “The Times and Iraq.”… People could differ about this or that aspect of the <em>Times’s</em>internal reckoning. But no one could doubt that it was a brave and serious effort. Bill Keller, executive editor at the time of the review, had earlier come out in favor of the Iraq invasion.

"As members of a common educational community, we owe to one another duties that, in some respects, go beyond what we owe to the public at large. In particular, we are obliged to refrain from saying or doing things to other members of this community that entail “threatening, tormenting, mocking, intimidating, maliciously or inappropriately ridiculing another’s work or comments beyond the scope of scholarly inquiry”… treat fellow members of this community with respect…. The Coases thread at the heart of this controversy did not consistently live up to that standard…. Vigorous debate, disagreement, and dissent is vital to a university community…. But within the NYU community, such debate can—indeed, must—be conducted in ways that demonstrate mutual respect, and that affirm that we all deserve to feel safe as fully fledged members of this community…. Part of doing better is striving to find effective and respectful ways to have difficult, even painful conversations with those with whom we disagree…. The Coases listserv may itself be part of the problem here…. The administration may well choose to consider alternative communications platforms…. In the meantime, I would urge that the use of Coases be limited to the kinds of simple informational exchanges for which it was initially intended…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:52562592,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://davidlat.substack.com/p/dean-trevor-morrison-speaks-out-about&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:229933,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Original Jurisdiction&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a9527a1-e841-4955-98c6-56d8b2fac6d7_256x256.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Dean Trevor Morrison Speaks Out About Anti-Semitism Controversy At NYU Law&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Welcome to Original Jurisdiction, the latest legal publication by me, David Lat.
