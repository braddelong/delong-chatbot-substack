presidential primary. And, in a surprising twist, he’s going after the competition by highlighting how “gutless” their Covid messaging has been. To be clear, Trump’s attack has less to do with his newfound enthusiasm for public health than it does with making others look weak.

In the low-friction world of internet-delivered or mediated services, start-ups are eager to spend ever-greater amounts of other people’s money to acquire customers, the goal being to emerge victorious in a winner-takes-all race…. Occasionally, these explosions of investor exuberance have funded the deployment of innovative technologies at sufficient scale to transform the market economy, as was the case with railroads, electrification, and the internet. Whether a bubble is productive depends on what it leaves behind. But all bubbles burst, so even investors in the vehicles of a productive episode inevitably will fall into one of two categories: the quick or the dead…. The managerial sagas of Uber, WeWork, and Theranos represent the downstream consequences of the flood unleashed by central banks. Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes may be the only one so far to have been caught crossing the line into criminal liability as she pumped and puffed up her company.

This was particularly the case in 2021…. As the new year unfolds, both the Fed and markets have a huge stake in inflation coming down in an orderly way. But the window of opportunity for policy to achieve this is rapidly closing.

Ron DeSantis. ‘I’ve had the booster’, Trump told One America News Network in an interview. ‘Many politicians, I watched a couple of politicians be interviewed and one of the questions was, “Did you get the booster?” Because they had the vaccine, and they’re answering like—in other words, the answer is “yes”, but they don’t want to say it, because they’re gutless. You gotta say it, whether you had it or not, say it.’” One advantage of being a cult leader is that it makes you the one Republican who can accidentally tell the truth and not see your political career ruined over it.</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2022/01/when-hes-right-hes-right-6">https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2022/01/when-hes-right-hes-right-6</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2022-01-14-fr/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2022-01-14-fr/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Become a free subscriber to receive this ‘Stack in your email.
