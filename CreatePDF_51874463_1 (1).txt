FIRST: Time to Post My 675-Word Elevator Pitch for a€oeSlouching Towards Utopiaa€d:

AN ECONOMIC HISTORY
OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY

J. BRADFORD DELONG

FOR
PREORDER

J. Bradford DeLong (Sep. 6,2022): Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Long 20th 
Century, 1870-2010 (New York: Basic Books,) 
<https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Historv-Twentieth-Century/dp/0465019595/>:

Slouching Towards Utopia is a book in the same class as Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, & Steel or 
Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century.

The theme of Diamonda€™ s Gwnsa€”a brilliant book, if not without its major flaws (and what things 
in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)a€”is: Civilizations in different 
places had access to different plant and animal resources, and for developing bioand other 
technologies two heads arebetter than one. WithinEurasia at the last theAtlantic Seaboard led in 
agricultural  wealthand hence first developed thesteel and the guns.Plus
Eurasians gained immunity to all the germs that jumped from Eurasian animals into humans. And 
everything else follows from those Atlantic-Seaboard differential advantages with respect to guns, 
germs, and steel.

The theme of Pikettya€™ s Capital^”a brilliant book, if not without its major flaws (and what 
things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)a€”is: Capitalists control 
enough political levers to keep the profit rate  around 5%, faster than economies grow. Only in 
exceptional eras of wars, revolutions,deep depressions, and the short post-WWIIsocial-democractic 
age of very rapid growth will wealthat the top fail to outpace wealthin
general. Hence in normal times income and wealth inequality is either already very high already or 
is rising fast. And everything else follows from that tendency toward high inequality.

The theme of Slouching Towards Utopiaa^'a brilliant book, if not without its major flaws (and what 
things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)a€”’is this:

The long 20th centurya€”the first whose history was primarily economic, with the economy not 
painted scene-backdrop but rather revolutionizing humanity's life every single generationa€” taught 
humanity expensive lessons. In 1870 industrial research labs, modern corporations, globalization, 
and the market economy a€’’which, as that genius Friedrich von Hayek most keen-sightedly observed, 
is tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutionsa€’’proved
keys to the lock that had kept humanity in its desperately poor iron cage, with the only 
comfortable ones being the thugs with spears who took from the near-subsistence farmers, and those 
with whom they shared their extractions. And previously unimaginable economic growth revolutionized 
human life over and over, generation by generation.

We should, thereafter, have straightforwardly turned our technological power and wealth to building 
something very close to a utopia: a truly human world. From 1870-2010 was 140 years. Few in 1870 
would have doubted that humanity more than ten times richer in material terms would build ourselves 
a utopia.


So what has gone wrong? Well, that idiot Friedrich von Hayek thought the unleashed market would do 
the whole job: a€oethe market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the marketa€D. 
But, as that genius Karl Polanyi put it: people will not stand for being told that there are no 
rightsbut propertyrights. They instead insist that a€oethemarket was made for man, not man for the 
marketa€D. The marketa€™ s treating those whom society saw
as equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought social explosion after explosion, blocking the 
road to utopia. They deserved communities, incomes, and stability. They needed their Polanyian 
rights to those things vindicated too.

Since 1870 humansa€’’Theodore Roosevelt, John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt, Vladimir Lenin, Margaret Thatcher, Deng Xiaoping, and othersa€” tried to think up 
solutions. They dissented from a€oethe market givetha€!a€n constructively and destructively. The 
demanded thatthe market do less, or different, and other institutions domore.
Only with a shotgun marriage of von Hayeka€™ s market to Polanyia€™ society, a marriage blessed by 
Keynesa€”a marriage that itself has so far failed its own sustainability testsa€”have we been able 
to even slouch towards utopia, and bring the El Dorado of a truly human world into view.

Whether we ever justify the full bill run up over the 140 years from 1870 to 2010 will likely 
depend on whether we remember and act upon that lesson.

One day, Vladimir Putin will no longer lead Russia. And, according to the writer and journalist 
Masha Gessen, there may then no longer be a country called Russia to lead. This was one of many 
startling analyses I heard in my conversation the other day with Gessen, a Moscow-born, New

Paragraphs:

Dan Wang appears to be right here, broadly, about the pattern. Where it is a challenge of adapting 
technology to manufacture at scale, China has excelled. But I do not grok oh, exactly, 
"science"-based industries are different in a way that matters. The O-ring theorya€”when you have 
enough scale you can achieve efficiencies so that you can afford the waste that comes from the lack 
of sufficient precision, and so win in the relatively simple where you still lose in
the very complexa€”is just not adequate to motivate this large scale pattern:

Dan Wang: Chinese Manufacturing'. a€~My researcha€! is toa€! think about why China has been fairly 
good in certain areas, and why it is still pretty behind in some othersa€!. Technologies are much 
more manufacturing-heavy, rather than science-heavy, China has for the most part figured that out. 
But wherever there is a lot of difficulty with the fundamental science, well there China is fairly 
weaka€!. solar photovoltaic, something
like large-scale batteries that go into electric vehicles, and something like consumer electronics 
componentsa€! are things where the manufacturing challenge is considerable, but ita€™ s all 
execution risk. There isna€™ t a lot of science involveda€!. Where China does face a lot of greater 
challenges are in things like chips, which require the integration of a lot of different areas of 
sciencea€! as well as wide-body aircraft, where the jet
engines require things like aerodynamics, material science, and a whole lot of math. So now 
wherever the challenge is mostly manufacturing, China is pretty gooda€!. Ia€™ m thinking about 
things in terms of manufacturing and sciencea€!. The analogy of a bodybuilder is the right one, to 
spend all of their time working on the biceps instead of working on the corea€!. The essence of 
dual circulation^! is to make the rest of the world as
dependent on China as Beijing can make ita€! and at the same time, it is to make sure that China is 
less dependent on the rest of the worlda€!. That is a fairly robust strategy, and it has the 
benefit of simplicitya€!

I would not say that Lael Brainard has been "dovish" in the past: I would say that she has been 
reality-based. I think she is still being reality-based. And, no, the risk the Fed will overreact 
and tighten us into a deep and unwarranted recession rather than a "rolling readjustment" is still 
a minor one:

Robert Armstrong & Ethan Wu: The Fed Gets Scary. a€~Lael Brainard, who is lined up to be Fed 
vice-chair and has been dovish on monetary policy in the past, on Tuesday said a€cerapida€D 
reduction of the Fed balance sheet could start in May. She made various other hawkish noises, as 
wella€!. Brainarda€™ s tough words landed in a market that was already plenty worried that the Fed 
was going to tighten the US economy right
into a big ola€™ recessiona€!. Do we need to worry even more now?a€! We dona€™t really know what 
the Fed balance sheet part of Brainarda€™ s commentsa€! portends. All we really know is that the 
Fed wanted to signal, again and more loudly, that they are going to tighten policy, soon, using 
every tool at hand. And this should make us worry that we will tighten right into a recessiona€!. 
You should be worrying more about
recession this morning than you were yesterday morninga€!

I have talked about Putin's attack on Ukraine as Spanish Civil War II. But it is not, really. It is 
not Hungary 1956 or Czechoslovakia 1968 or Poland at the end of the 1970s or Grozny either. It 
marks, rather, the limits of the power of a Muscovy that has 150 rather than 350 million people, 
spends 6% rather than 40% of national income on the military, faces a NATO willing to ship weapons 
to those it attacks, and comes at the end rather than in the middle of the
development of Eastern-European nationalism.

The joker, of course, is that it still has lots and lots of nuclear weapons:

Edward Luce: The World-Changing Meaning of Putin'. a€~Milestones area€! the point at which history 
says it can no longer be ignored. February 24 was the date Russia invaded Ukrainea€!. Geopolitics 
is now divided between the west and a Chinese-Russian Eurasiaa€!. Putin, whose loathing of the west 
has become his driving motive, has been the one to bring down the curtain. It is also ironic. 
Western strategists have tended to write
off Russia as a declining power. But Russiaa€™ s waning status has put it in more of a hurry than 
Chinaa€!. Joe Biden has in recent weeks turned into a Ronald Reagan-style crusader for global 
freedoma€!. Americaa€™ s undeclared goal is for Russian regime changea€!. The most surprising 
response to Putina€™ s aggression has been the intensity of the westa€™ s public reaction. It is an 
open question whether this will endurea€!.

Trump and Le Pen would present a very different west to the one championed by Biden and Emmanuel 
Macron. A new era is undoubtedly upon us. But the westa€™ s resolve is not yet a givena€!

As I see it, even the Kremlin's idea of Muscovy a€~Rus as a a€oegreat powera€D is limited to near 
hegemony in the "near abroad" and the recognition that interview counts in the Balkans in the 
Middle Easta€’’although, perhaps, not decisively. Also, the periodic American fits of action that 
it should promote "democracy" are annoying and need to be squelched by a global coalition of 
autocrats willing to do things like put their thumbs on the scales intervening
in US politics to attempt to elect Donald Trump. Also nuclear weapons. But how can Muscovy a€~Rus 
think it is a great power in today's world on a scale higher than that of Italy? It is puzzling:

KGBa€!. This group have remained remarkably stable and homogenous under Putina€l. Putin and his 
immediate circle remain intensely resentful
of the way in which the Soviet Union, Russia and their own service collapsed in the 1990sa€!. Five 
of Putina€™ s inner circle: Sergei Lavrov, 71, foreign minister; Sergei Naryshkin, 67, foreign 
intelligence chief; Nikolai Patrushev, 70, secretary of Russiaa€™ s security council; Igor Sechin, 
61, chief executive of Rosneft; Sergei Shoigu, 66, defence minister. In his first years in power, 
Putina€! could be regarded as a€oefirst among
equalsa€Da€!. No longer. Increasingly, even the siloviki have been publicly reduced to servants of 
the autocrata€!. Insofar as top economic officials with a€oepatriotic liberala€D leanings were ever 
part of this inner core, they have long since been excludeda€!. These men are known in Russia as 
the a€cesilovikia€Da€! in the Irish phrase, a€oehard mena€Da€i. Putin and the siloviki have the 
sympathy of very large parts of the Russian
populationa€!. Above all, for deep historical, cultural, professional and personal reasons, the 
siloviki and the Russian official elite in general are utterly, irrevocably committed to the idea 
of Russia as a great power and one pole of a multipolar world. If you do not believe in that, you 
are not part of the Russian establishment, just as if you do not believe in US global primacy you 
are not part of the US foreign and security establishment^!

My view of Lenina€™ s State and Revolution is that it is Lenin-as-utopian-dreamer. But even before 
the coup, he had never let his utopian dreams interfere with his political maneuverings either 
within the socialist movement or with respect to propaganda and action outside it. The 
utopian-dreamer had no influence on the power-wieldera€”save that the utopian dreams kept him from 
recognizing very important parts of the reality he was dealing with, and that
was one of the principal factors leading to the Bolshevik disaster:

Robert Service: Lenin: A Biography. a€™ So why has Lenin been charged with monumental insincerity 
in relation to the book [State and Revolution]? The main reason lies in the contrast between the 
predictions made in The State and Revolution and the reality of Bolshevism in power. The State and 
Revolution described an imminent future when the working class would become the ruling class and 
ordinary workers themselves take
the crucial decisions of state and society. Things turned out very differently after October 1917, 
when the Soviet state quickly became a one-party dictatorship that used force against industrial 
strikes and political protests by workers. A long shadow of doubt was cast over his intentions when 
he wrote The State and Revolutiona€\

Very nicely put by Andrew Gelman:

Andrew Gelman: One-Sided Journalism & the Fundamental Attribution Error. a€~Allsop continues: "This 
is itself a much broader problem than mere false equivalence, reflectinga€”as Brian Beutler, of 
Crooked Media, and others have put ita€”the commonplace journalistic assumption that a€~Republican 
bad faitha€! is just a feature of the landscapea€™ , whereas a given Democrat is a€™ an actor with 
agency, and subject to
scrutiny.a€™ a€D And that reminded me of something Ia€™ ve noticed in popular history writing, 
which is a form of reasoning that focuses on the mistakes on a€oeour sidea€D and assumes that 
whatever a€oetheir sidea€D does is pre-ordained. Ita€™ s a sort of fundamental attribution error by 
which our decisions and mistakes are based on context and circumstance, whereas theirs are based on

Subject: H. Rider Haggard Was Somewhat More Sophisticated than the Stereotype Suggestsa€!

His King Solomona€™ s Mines <https://archive.org/details/kingsolomonsmineOOOQhagg_ 
q8s2/page/n3/mode/2up>a€! Consider the character of Umbopa-Ignosi. He starts out as the stereotype 
of the clever servanta€”and one who is uppity, and does not accept his subordinate place in the 
racial hierarchy, calling the narrator and his companions a€cewhite mena€D rather than 
a€cechiefsa€D. He ends the book the equivalent of the Roman Emperor Trajan, while
the narrator is terrified at what he has gotten himself into. Yet it is not Umbopa-Ignosi who has 
changed.

At the start of the book:

The evening before the day we had fixed for our departure the Zulu Khiva informed me that a Kafir 
was waiting to see mea€! a a€ceKeshlaa€D or ringed man; that is, he wore on his head the black 
ring, made of a species of gum polished with fat and worked up in the hair, which is usually 
assumed by Zulus on attaining a certain age or dignity. Also it struck me that his face was 
familiar to me. a€ceWell,a€D I said at last, a€oeWhat is
your name?a€D

a€ceUmbopa,a€D answered the man in a slow, deep voice.
a€oel have seen your face before .a€D

a€oeYes; the Inkoosi, the chief, my father, saw my face at the place of the Little Handa€Da€”that 
is, Isandhlwanaa€”a€oeon the day before the battle.a€D

Then I remembered. I was one of Lord Chelmsforda€™ s guides in that unlucky Zulu War, and had the 
good fortune to leave the camp in charge of some wagons on the day before the battle. While I was 
waiting for the cattle to be inspanned I fell into conversation with this man, who held some small 
command among the native auxiliaries, and he had expressed to me his doubts as to the safety of the 
camp. At the time I told him to hold
his tongue, and leave such matters to wiser heads; but afterwards I thought of his words.

a€oel remember,a€D I said; a€oewhat is it you want?a€D

a€oelt is this, a€~Macumazahn.a€™ a€D That is my Kafir name, and means the man who gets up in the 
middle of the night, or, in vulgar English, he who keeps his eyes open. a€oel hear that you go on a 
great expedition far into the North with the white chiefs from over the water. Is it a true word?a€D
a€celt is.a€D

My view of Lenina€™ s State and Revolution is that it is Lenin-as-utopian-dreamer. But even before 
the coup, he had never let his utopian dreams interfere with his political maneuverings either 
within the socialist movement or with respect to propaganda and action outside it. The 
utopian-dreamer had no influence on the power-wieldera€”save that the utopian dreams kept him from 
recognizing very important parts of the reality he was dealing with, and that
was one of the principal factors leading to the Bolshevik disaster:

Robert Service: Lenin: A Biography. a€™ So why has Lenin been charged with monumental insincerity 
in relation to the book [State and Revolution]? The main reason lies in the contrast between the 
predictions made in The State and Revolution and the reality of Bolshevism in power. The State and 
Revolution described an imminent future when the working class would become the ruling class and 
ordinary workers themselves take
the crucial decisions of state and society. Things turned out very differently after October 1917, 
when the Soviet state quickly became a one-party dictatorship that used force against industrial 
strikes and political protests by workers. A long shadow of doubt was cast over his intentions when 
he wrote The State and Revolution^}

Very nicely put by Andrew Gelman:

Andrew Gelman: One-Sided Journalism & the Fundamental Attribution Error. a€~Allsop continues: "This 
is itself a much broader problem than mere false equivalence, reflectinga€”as Brian Beutler, of 
Crooked Media, and others have put ita€”the commonplace journalistic assumption that a€~Republican 
bad faitha€! is just a feature of the landscapea€™ , whereas a given Democrat is a€™ an actor with 
agency, and subject to
scrutiny.a€™ a€D And that reminded me of something Ia€™ ve noticed in popular history writing, 
which is a form of reasoning that focuses on the mistakes on a€oeour sidea€D and assumes that 
whatever a€oetheir sidea€D does is pre-ordained. Ita€™ s a sort of fundamental attribution error by

Subject: H. Rider Haggard Was Somewhat More Sophisticated than the Stereotype Suggestsa€!

His King Solomona€™ s Mines <https://archive.org/details/kingsolomonsmineOOOOhagg_ 
q8s2/page/n3/mode/2up>a€! Consider the character of Umbopa-Ignosi. He starts out as the stereotype 
of the clever servanta€”and one who is uppity, and does not accept his subordinate place in the 
racial hierarchy, calling the narrator and his companions a€cewhite mena€D rather than 
a€cechiefsa€D. He ends the book the equivalent of the Roman Emperor Trajan, while
the narrator is terrified at what he has gotten himself into. Yet it is not Umbopa-Ignosi who has 
changed.

At the start of the book:

The evening before the day we had fixed for our departure the Zulu Khiva informed me that a Kafir 
was waiting to see mea€! a a€ceKeshlaa€D or ringed man; that is, he wore on his head the black 
ring, made of a species of gum polished with fat and worked up in the hair, which is usually 
assumed by Zulus on attaining a certain age or dignity. Also it struck me that his face was 
familiar to me. a€ceWell,a€D I said at last, a€oeWhat is
your name?a€D

a€ceUmbopa,a€D answered the man in a slow, deep voice.
a€oel have seen your face before .a€D

a€oeYes; the Inkoosi, the chief, my father, saw my face at the place of the Little Handa€Da€”that 
is, Isandhlwanaa€”a€oeon the day before the battle.a€D

Then I remembered. I was one of Lord Chelmsforda€™ s guides in that unlucky Zulu War, and had the 
good fortune to leave the camp in charge of some wagons on the day before the battle. While I was 
waiting for the cattle to be inspanned I fell into conversation with this man, who held some small 
command among the native auxiliaries, and he had expressed to me his doubts as to the safety of the 
camp. At the time I told him to hold
his tongue, and leave such matters to wiser heads; but afterwards I thought of his words.

a€oel remember,a€D I said; a€oewhat is it you want?a€D

a€oelt is this, a€~Macumazahn.a€™ a€D That is my Kafir name, and means the man who gets up in the 
middle of the night, or, in vulgar English, he who keeps his eyes open. a€oel hear that you go on a 
great expedition far into the North with the white chiefs from over the water. Is it a true word?a€D
a€oelt is.a€D

a€oel hear that you go even to the Lukanga River, a moona€™ s journey beyond the Manica country. Is 
this so also, a€~Macumazahn?a€™ a€D
a€oeWhy do you ask whither we go? What is it to you?a€D I answered suspiciously, for the objects of 
our journey had been kept a dead secret.
a€oelt is this, O white men, that if indeed you travel so far I would travel with you.a€D

There was a certain assumption of dignity in the mana€™ s mode of speech, and especially in his use 
of the words a€oeO white men,a€D instead of a€oeO Inkosis,a€D or chiefs, which struck me. a€oeYou 
forget yourself a little,a€D I said. a€oeYour words run out unawares. That is not the way to speak. 
What is your name, and where is your kraal? Tell us, that we may know with whom we have to deal.a€D
And at the end;

a€oeBehold your king!a€! Go fight and fall for him, as is the duty of brave men, and cursed and 
shameful for ever be the name of him who shrinks from death for his king, or who turns his back to 
the foe. Behold your king, chiefs, captains, and soldiers! Now do your homage to the sacred Snake, 
and then follow on, that Incubu and I may show you a road to the heart of Twalaa€™ s host.a€D There 
was a momenta€™ s pause, then
suddenly a murmur arose from the serried phalanxes before us, a sound like the distant whisper of 
the sea, caused by the gentle tapping of the handles of six thousand spears against their 
holdersa€™ shields. Slowly it swelled, till its growing volume deepened and widened into a roar of 
rolling noise, that echoed like thunder against the mountains, and filled the air with heavy waves 
of sound. Then it decreased, and by faint degrees died
away into nothing, and suddenly out crashed the royal salute.

Ignosi, I thought to myself, might well be a proud man that day, for no Roman emperor ever had such 
a salutation from gladiators a€oeabout to die.a€D

Ignosi acknowledged this magnificent act of homage by lifting his battle-axe, and then the Greys 
filed off in a triple-line formation, each line containing about one thousand fighting men, 
exclusive of officers. When the last companies had advanced some five hundred yards, Ignosi put 
himself at the head of the Buffaloes, which regiment was drawn up in a similar three-fold 
formation, and gave the word to march, and off we went, I,
needless to say, uttering the most heartfelt prayers that I might emerge from that entertainment 
with a whole skin.
