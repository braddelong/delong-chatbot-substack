Lilliana Mason: 'The people -who really like Trump in 2018 are the same ones who really disliked 
Blacks, Muslims, LGBT+, and Hispanics in 2011. It's NOT THE SAME for the GOP in general, or even 
for Ryan or McConnell. Trump is
drawing on this particular group of people to a unique degree 
<http://cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/activating-animus-the-
uniquely-social-roots-of-trump-
support/D96C71C353D065F62A3F19B504FA7577>. He is also doing this ACROSS PARTIES. The new 
MAGA/anti-MAGA conflict is not an entirely partisan one. It's about white Christian supremacy 
versus a fully multi-racial
democracy. The Trump effect occurs most powerfully at the most hateful end of the spectrum (above 
0.5 on the animus scale). And it's not happening for anyone on the Democratic side. Hating 
Christians and White people doesn't predict
favorability toward any Democratic figures or the Democratic Party. So it isn't "anti-White racism" 
(whatever that means) motivating the left. It's not "both sides." This means that there is a 
faction in American politics that has moved

from party to party, can be recruited from either party, and responds especially well to hatred of 
marginalized groups. They're not just Republicans or Democrats, they're a third faction that 
targets parties. THIS is the faction we, as
Americans, should be worried about. "Bipartisanship" is not the answer to the problem. We need to 
confront this particular faction of Americans who have been uniquely visible and anti-democratic 
since before the Civil War (when they
were Democrats)a€!

would have kept going down that path.a€D Some residents were furious. a€oeWhat has gone terribly

who live right near a
proposed development care a lot about it, and more often than not they oppose projects that 
increase housing density. And because every project in a modern city is located near somebody, 
almost every effort to increase housing supply
attracts opposition^!. In the last decade, pro-development advocates have found ways to effectively 
organize for more housing. A big part of the solution was to give activists a shared enemy: the

Josh Marshall: You Wouldna€™ t Know It From the US News Coverage, Buta€\: a€~Key leaders of the US 
backed government over the last two decades are relaxedly meeting with the political leadership of 
the Taliban in Kabul about
the formation of the new governmental. Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan President whose precipitous flight 
hastened the rapid collapse of the government last weekend says he supports these negotiations and 
is in the process of negotiating his
own return to the countrya€l. Ghania€™ s brother, Hashmat Ghani, pledged loyalty to the Taliban and 
has encouraged all Afghans to do the same. I have no idea if that is in line with these 
negotiations or something differenta€l.. Does all
this mean that our US-backed leaders are scurrilous turncoats jumping to secure their power and 
wealth under the new regime? Or do they possibly not see the whole turnover in the cataclysmic 
terms we seem to? I suspect ita€™ s some
of both. But I dona€™ t know enough about the country to tell. Whichever it is seems highly 
relevant to how we got here and where this is goinga€l. It is remarkable to me that you can immerse 
yourself in the current US media coverage
and as far as I can tell see very, very little discussion of this at all. I only noticed it and 
started digging around because I noticed Abdullaha€™ s tweet and did some digginga€!

though there is a throwaway sentence that says it will happen) or any data presented. I dona€™ t 
understand how this is not undue
pressure  on the agencies to approve the booster, as stated. Second, wherea€™ s the data? Yes, the 
current administration has inherited the lack of data, but ita€™ s mid-August. This policy by press 
release is confusing and undermines
confidence because people on Twitter are now trying to reverse-engineer box plots from screenshots 
of other countries press releases (also without papers). Third, so we are going to give a third

Matthew Yglesias: Is Cuban Healthcare Actually Good?'. a€~Better than average for such a poor 
country, but hardly a huge success storya€!. The core claims to fame of the Cuban healthcare system 
are the linked facts that the country
has a low infant mortality rate (4.1 per 1,000, which is below the high-income country average of 5 
per 1,000)a€!. Roberto Gonzalez shows that the flip side of Cubaa€™ s abnormally low neo-natal 
fatality rate is an unusually high late-
fetal death ratea€!. The most likely is that they are simply misclassifying the early-life deaths 
of premature infants as lost pregnancies. The other possible explanations would reflect even worse 
on the Cuban healthcare systema€!. If you
look at late-fetal and early-neonatal deaths as a combined phenomenon, Cubaa€™ s performance drops 
to well below that of rich countries as well as Chile and Costa Rica, though still good relative to 
Latin America as a wholea€!

Is Cuban healthcare actually good?

Scott Imberman: d€™ This seems like the most comprehensive and best study yet. Random sample, 
followed over time, regular asymptomatic testing. What do they find? 
<https://ndm.ox.ac.uk/files/coronavirus/covid-19-infection-
survey/finalfinalcombinedve20210816.pdf> Ia€™ 11 focus the Pfizer (BNT162b2) vaccines since that is 
what was most used in the US. Vaccines just as effective against Delta infection as Alpha (about 
80%). Somewhat less effective on
symptomatic          infection but still very strong (84%). Prior infection also quite good. Pfizer 
shows some evidence of waning immunity over 3 months. If trend continues, I can see why Biden admin 
is worried and pushing for boosters. AZ
shows   little waning immunity-good news for J&J folks! Dosing interval doesna€™t seem to matter, 
though above/below 9 week cutoff may not be that informative for the 3 week dosing schedule used in 
US. Final point-this is exactly
the  kind of study CDC and NIH should be doing and ita€™ s a travesty they have not. But while the 
best time to start was yesterday, the second best time is today. Fina€!
