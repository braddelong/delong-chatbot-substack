It was just the vibe. The overwhelming bro-left vibe. The “How dare anybody actually try to do something to make a better world! Become a lanyard geek working for the UN trying to stop or shorten a war? F*** No! Dweebs! Let us radically reject! Let us show that we radically reject by smoking weed and bullshitting!” vibe.</p><p>Perhaps the real problem I had is that Ursula K. LeGuin’s “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas“ &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/newdimensions300gard/page/n13/mode/1up">https://archive.org/details/newdimensions300gard/page/n13/mode/1up</a>&gt; is not written to be an easy story. If your reaction is: Ones who walk away, yay! Omelas, boo!—Well, then, I do not think you have understood the story or LeGuin. I would dare say I do not think you have really read the story at all. The ones who walk away from Omelas, after all. Do they know where they are going? Ursula Le Guin will only say that they “seem to”. But it may not exist. It is less imaginable than the city of compromised happiness.</p><p>We do not know where they arrive, or if, indeed, they arrive anywhere. One powerful key that provides a way to read the story suggests that they die in the wilderness. Each of them leaves <em>alone, </em>without friends or companions or comrades, heading for the mountains. You do not need to be an anthropologist’s daughter to know that the chances of survival of a lone East African Plains Ape, however well-equipped, in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest are very small indeed. Another powerful key is to read it alongside J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Leaf by Niggle” &lt;<a href="https://wp.lps.org/mpayant/files/2010/08/LEAF-BY-NIGGLE.pdf">https://wp.lps.org/mpayant/files/2010/08/LEAF-BY-NIGGLE.pdf</a>&gt; and its ending: “They both laughed. Laughed—the mountains rang with it!” A third powerful key is to consider it as a refutation of the William James theme on which it is based: James thought the citizens of Omelas would be unable to live with themselves, and “Omelas” can be read as LeGuin pointing out that—as so much history shows—James was simply wrong for the overwhelming proportion of people. The ones who choose or find themselves forced to walk away from Omelas are few and rare.</p><p>And there are many other possible keys to the story. </p><p>Ursula K.

Our beloved editor, Izabella Kaminska, is leaving after a 13-year stint at the blog. Having joined in 2008 as a junior reporter after working for Big Oil (yes, that’s right conspiracy theorists), Reuters and CNBC, Izzy rose through the ranks to finally be made head honcho in 2017, succeeding FTAV founder Paul Murphy. She will be sorely missed by all of us, and many of you. Readers will agree that there is no one quite like Izzy…. Here are some stories, and a video, from her over the years…. Whether “Fulfilled by Amazon” was at risk of being swamped by counterfeit goods due to its co-mingling policy…. Did currency debasement lead to the collapse of the Roman Empire?… Uber’s business model didn’t look sustainable…. Izzy… produced a fantastic mini-film about QAnon…. Over 2,000 words on how the Roman Empire dealt with the pirate threat to its grain supplies…. Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?…. A history of bitcoin. From 2013. Need we say more?… Izzy had a go at working for Deliveroo…. Explaining the commodity warehouse trade with scripture…. Don’t have a clue what real-time gross settlement systems are?… Solar panel prices…. There’s no better example than this post on the problem with DAOs from… six years ago…. FT Alphaville: Vaudeville…. So long Izzy, and thank you for the memories. We wish you all the best at your next endeavour…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/70bfe728-5b94-49a8-9100-839b9b49417e">https://www.ft.com/content/70bfe728-5b94-49a8-9100-839b9b49417e</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Josh Barro</strong>: <em>Why I Hate Cryptocurrency</em>: ‘As someone who is in general more favorable to the social value of finance than a lot of commentators… I want finance to be useful, serious, and furthering the production of useful products and services in the real economy. I want banks lending for the construction of new buildings; equity markets making it possible for the most promising companies to raise funds to build useful products; bond markets making cheap and efficient financing available for public and private activities that will support payment of interest on the bonds. I was a big champion of the Fed’s actions to rescue the financial system in spring 2020 because I know a robust and liquid financial system isn’t just something people on Wall Street like—it’s something that makes it possible to get a mortgage, use a credit card, remain employed at a company, and generally enjoy all the things made possible by a modern economy. And I am concerned that tens of millions of Americans investing in a stupid market with no such thing as fundamental value… is likely to lead to significant financial dislocation and reduced trust in the financial system when a lot of them lose their shirts.

He remains unconvinced that we are facing anything more than a transitional shock. So what exactly is&nbsp;overheating? What’s “too hot?” The most plausible answer is that the speed with which we’ve returned to normal is extremely fast, and that’s taxing the system as a whole. This seems reasonable. It has been an extraordinary rapid bounce back, at least from the perspective of past downturns. And not only has the bounce back been very rapid, consumption patterns have changed amid the bounce back. As everyone knows by now, people are buying a lot more “stuff” relative to services, and as such the price of durable goods has shot up.&nbsp;One takeaway from all this is that it may be too soon to bury the t-word, “transitory.” Sure, nobody uses the word anymore. Most people seem to be too embarrassed to even say it out loud. But there are still reasons to think that the big upward pressure we’ve seen in prices is related to the rapid journey back to trend and the shift in consumer demand.&nbsp;And it’s important to remember that the rapid journey back to trend is a good thing…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:47094020,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-72-team-transitory-roars&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:192845,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Chartbook&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a8e73950-03bb-4589-afaf-d9cdd55ab61b_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Chartbook #72: Team Transitory Roars Back &quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;After the record series of “prints” for US CPI inflation in October, November and December 2021, there was a sense that the balance of policy argument had shifted.

The costs of making a dovish error are substantially lower than the cost of making a hawkish error. If you tighten too little, then a year from now inflation is higher than you’d like it to be, which annoys people and imposes some small efficiency costs across the economy, but at least you have all the tools you need to address the problem. If you tighten too much then a year from now employment is lower than it otherwise would be, which is more than a mere annoyance and which is likely to involve economic costs substantially larger than those associated with an inflation overshoot. Oh, and there may not be much you can do about it…. There were thus very good reasons for the Fed to be patient last year as inflation rose…. I am skeptical that the Fed will actually find itself able to go through with all of this, but if it does it will pack into about one year what took roughly four during the last tightening cycle.&nbsp;In doing this, the Fed has given itself very little margin for error…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:47510548,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://ryanavent.substack.com/p/the-fed-looks-increasingly-determined&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:19756,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Bellows&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Fed looks increasingly determined to make a major policy error&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Making monetary policy is hard, and I sympathize with officials at the Fed who have to make very difficult and very consequential decisions under extreme uncertainty.
