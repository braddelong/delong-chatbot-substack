CONDITION: No, Inflation Is Not Getting Entrenched

The odds that expectations of higher future inflation are getting entrenched in the labor and 
product markets while skipping the bond market are extremely, extremely low:

FIRST: An Earlier Version of My a€oeSingularity in Our Past Light Conea€D Meditation from 
a€oeSlouching Towards Utopiaa€Da€!

As Cosma Shalizi (2010) Says, a€ceThe Singularity Is in Our Pastd€m Look at the bleeding edge of 
urban North Atlantic or East Asian civilization, and you see a world fundamentally unlike any human 
past. Hunting, gathering, farming, herding, spinning and weaving, cleaning, digging, smelting metal 
and shaping wood, assembling structuresa€“all of the a€~in the
sweate of thy face shalt thou eate breada€™ things that typical humans have typically done since we 
became jumped-up monkeys on the East African veldta€“are now the occupations of a small and 
dwindling proportion of humans.

And where we do have farmers, herdsmen, manufacturing workers, construction workers, and miners, 
they are overwhelmingly controllers of machines and increasingly programmers of robots. They are no 
longer people who make or shape thingsa€‘yhcrwrea€“with their handsa€“manw.

At the bleeding edge of the urban North Atlantic and East Asia today, few focus on making more of 
necessities. There are enough calories that it is not necessary that anybody need be hungry. There 
is nough shelter that it is not necessary that anybody need be wet. There is enough clothing that 
it is not necessary that anybody need be cold. And enough stuff to aid daily life


that nobody need feel under the pressure of lack of something necessary. We are not in the realm of 
necessity.

What do modern people do? Increasingly, they push forward the corpus of technological and 
scientific knowledge. They educate each other. They doctor each other. They nurse each other. They 
care for the young and the old. They entertain each other. They provide other services for each 
other to take advantage of the benefits of specialization. And they engage in
complicated symbolic interactions that have the emergent effect of distributing status and power 
and coordinating the seven-billion person division of labor of todaya€™ s economy. We have crossed 
a great divide between what we used to do in all previous human history and what we do now. Since 
we are not in the realm of necessity, we ought to be in the realm of
freedom.

But although we have largely set these post-agrarian post-industrial patterns for the next stage of 
human history, the human world of this next stage is only half-made. The future is already 
herea€“it is just not evenly distributed. Of the 7.2 billion people alive in the world today, at 
least 25% billion still live lives that are hard to distinguish from the lives of our pre-industrial
ancestors. Only 5% of todaya€™ s world population lives in countries where income per capita is 
greater than $40,000 per year; only 10% lives in countries where income per capita is greater than 
$20,000 per year.

The bulk of the worlda€™ s population is on the stairway to modernity. The patterns are set. The 
top of the stairway is visiblea€ “although it is not clear which top we shall reach: many possible 
tops are immanent in the patterns. Nevertheless, the climb will be hard. And that is what much of 
the history of the twenty-first and twenty-second centuries is likely to be about.
So how did this great transformation happen? And how did the way it happened shape who we are now 
and who we will be in the future?

The traditional tools, practices, patterns, and molds of history are not as much help in telling 
this story as one might hope. The history of how the world was greatly transformed is primarily 
economic and technological, and secondarily political and social. But historians are not used to 
placing the economic and technological in first place. In the study of any period back
before 1800, there is no way that economic history can be seen as even one of the principal axes. 
Before 1800, most history at even the century-levela€“let alone the decade-level or the 
year-levela€ “could not be economic history. History is change. And before 1800 economic factors 
changed only slowly. The structure and functioning of the economy at the end of any
given century was pretty close to what it had been at the beginning.

The economy was then was much more the background against which the action of a play takes place 
than like a dynamic foreground character. Changes in humanitya€™ s economya€“how people made, 
distributed, and consumed the material necessities and conveniences of their livesa€ “required long 
exposures to become visible. Economic history could bea€“indeed,
had to bea€“a specialized a€~long durationa€™ history. It required a scope of perhaps 500 years, if 
not more, to be properly placed in the foreground of any historical canvas. And even then the story 
told was of recurrent patterns and cycles rather than development and change.

But since 1750 or so things have been different. The pace of economic change has been so great as 
to shake the rest of history to its foundation. For perhaps the first time, the making and using 
the necessities and conveniences of daily lifea€“and how production, distribution, and consumption 
changeda€“has been the driving force behind a single centurya€™ s history.
Even in the most long-established of professions, the pattern and rhythm of work life today is so 
very different from that of our ancestors as to be almost unrecognizable. It is these changes in 
production and also in home life and consumption, and the reactions to them, that make up the 
center ring action of the history that has made us who we are.

This post-1750 history takes place in two stages. The first stage is the nineteenth century: the 
century of the British Industrial Revolution. Call it 1750-1870. It opens up the possibilities. The 
second stage is the twentieth century. Call it 1870-2010. It sets the patterns into which the human 
world is likely to grow in the future.

incredible! Yet they cana€™ t seem to keep any cash. No matter how much they raise they spend more 
with nothing meaningful to show for it. Where
are  the new models? Where are the upgrades to the current models? Why are they firing 10% of the

Eric Topol writes, a€oeit took more than 7 months for the Omicron BA.l booster to be tested, a 
delay that is exceedingly long and unacceptable relative to the timing of validation and production

SUBJECT: Final Version of My Economist Piece:

Finance and economics

Brad DeLong asks what America can learn from its past bouts of inflation

In 1947 and 1951 the problem went away by itself. In 1920 the Fed tightened too much, says the 
economist

THE FIRST and most important thing to recognise about the macroeconomic situation in America is 
that Jerome Powell and his Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should be taking victory laps. Two 
and a half years after the start of the financial crisis in 2007, Americaa€™ s unemployment rate 
was kissing 10%, the Federal Reserve realised that it was out of
firepower and the Obama administration had just thrown away its ability to help by promising to 
veto spending and tax bills that were insufficiently austere. After that moment it would take six 
years for Americaa€™ s economy to approach full employment. The impact of deficient employment 
meant that output was $7trn lower in 2013 than it would have been otherwise.
Additional losses stemmed from the investments not made, business models not experimented with and 
workers not trained during the decade of anaemic recovery.

We have avoided all that this time around. Relative to the Fed presided over by Ben Bernanke 
between 2006 and 2014, Mr Powella€™ s team are public benefactors to the residents of America to 
the tune of $20trn, if you consider that there are more jobs and fewer idle factories now and in 
the future because of their actions. We have an uptick in inflation partly because the
Feda€’’alongside Congress and the presidencya€’’responded far more aggressively to the 
pandemic-induced recession than to the global financial crisis. A world in which the economy 
recovers so quickly that inflation emerges is better than one in which recovery drags on painfully 
for years.

America has faced five bouts of inflation in the past century or soa€”or six, depending on whether 
you count the 1970s as one or two episodes. The inflation during the second world war, which was 
tamed by price controls, is not relevant to our situation. That leaves four (or perhaps five) 
historical parallels which provide lessons in how to deal with the current inflation
problem.

The first is the inflation of the first world war, which was brought under control when the newly 
established Fed raised its discount rate from 3.75% to 4.5% between November 1917 and April 1918, 
and then again to 7% between October 1919 and June 2020. This triggered a short but very deep 
recession accompanied by substantial deflation. Milton Friedman later judged
that the Fed moved too latea€”it should have started raising interest rates a year or more before 
it dida€”but that it moved too far when it did move.

The second is the inflation which emerged after the second world war. It peaked at 19.7% in the 
year to March 1947 as Americaa€™ s economy reoriented itself from its wartime to its post-war 
structural configuration. Tank factories turned back into car factories. Resources that had been 
devoted to building factories and equipping them with tools were released to make all
the consumer goods that had been rationed during the war. The second world wara€™ s 
military-industrial complex was dismantled. Prices and wages went up in sectors where demand was 
high but supply constrained in order to pull resources to where they were wanted. The Fed did 
nothing. It was focused instead on propping up the value of all the Treasury bonds that had
been issued to fight the war. Inflation averaged 8% over the following year and then went negative 
in 1949, when a minor recession came. Once supply had shifted to match the sectoral pattern of 
demand, the bottlenecks and the upward price pressure disappeared. Because few expected the 
inflationary trend to continue, nobody was able to demand a high wage increase or
get away with a price increase, as those who paid them shrugged and said a€oeita€™ s just 
inflationa€D.

The third bout came in 1951. Inflation peaked at 9.4% in the year to February that year as America 
geared up to fight the Korean war and, perhaps more important, as it built up its global military 
capabilities in the early years of the cold war. The military-industrial complex was rebuilt, and 
rebuilt for a nuclear and aerospace age. Again, the Fed did nothing. And the inflation
wave passed. By March 1952 it was below 2%. And recession was avoided until a minor one in late 
1953. Again, once supply had shifted to match the sectoral pattern of demand, the bottlenecks and 
the upward price pressure disappeared. Once again, because few expected the inflationary trend to 
continue, no one was able to ask for a high wage increase or get away with a
price increase.

The fourth, or the fourth and fifth, came between 1966 and 1984. Inflation rose from 2% at the 
start of 1966 to 4.4% on Richard Nixona€™ s inauguration in January 1969. It then rose and fell 
throughout the 1970s before soaring to a peak of 12.8% in March 1980. The Fed dithered. Arthur 
Burns, its chairman from 1970 to 1978, was too interested in maintaining a strong
economy while his friend and patron Nixon ran for re-election in 1972. He did not believe that 
Congress would let him keep interest rates high enough for long enough to cure inflation through 
monetary policy. It was only when Paul Volcker became chairman that interest rates were raised to a 
peak of 16.9% in December 1980, and were not lowered below 10% until August
1982.

peak of 16.9% in December 1980, and were not lowered below 10% until August
1982.

Which of these is our current situation most like? In my view, the second and third bouts of 
inflation, in 1947 and 1951, are the right models. That is because the long-term inflation 
expectations implicit in the bond market are still trading at their normal 
a€oein-the-long-run-inflation-will-be-about-2.5%a€n range. Bond traders appear to expect a little 
extra inflation over the
next couple of years, but after that a return to what has become considered normal. Unless workers 
and managers see more inflation in the future than bond tradersa€”something that seems unlikely to 
mea€”they have no warrant for pushing for high wage increases or thinking that they can get away 
with price increases ahead of a continuing inflation wave. So there is
considerable hope (though hope is not confidence) for a soft landing.

But there are two risks of a hard landing. One thing to fear is that the inflation episode today is 
like that of 1920. Back then the problem would have passed on its own, but the Fed tightened too 
much in response. There are no indications of overtightening yet, but then there wouldna€™ t be: 
the effects of the roughly two-percentage-point rise in both nominal and inflation-
indexed ten-year Treasury rates since December 2021 will not begin to show in the real economic 
data until 2023.

The second risk is that this is indeed like the 1970s, and so it is imperative to scotch any 
expectations of an inflationary spiral before they are even formed. Turn on the news, and there is 
constant chatter that likens our situation to that of the 1970s, with suggestions to hedge against 
inflation .This may reflect the tendency of social and professional media towards clickbait, but
it could nonetheless shift expectations. There is little indication so far of such a shift in the 
prices of long-term bonds. Possibly it is imprudent to place too much weight on this particular 
harbinger alone.

Most of the time I think it would be great fun to be a member of the FOMC. Not today. The risks 
inherent within our current situation are immense. And misjudgments caused by a failure to listen 
to the right signals would be devastating.
