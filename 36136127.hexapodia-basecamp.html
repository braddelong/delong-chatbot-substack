Hence “Hexapodia as the key insight—because it is not too clear on the locomotion of ground dwellers, and does not distinguish between <em>wheels</em> and feet.</p><p>Noah Smith and I take a lesson from this: that there is often some key nugget of fact that—if you grok it correctly and place it in its proper contest—will transform your view of the situation, and allow you to grok it correctly.

I see a possible connection here with the Great Secrets. During the last two hundred and twenty days, there have been increasing reports of zone interface instability in the region below Harmonious Repose. As the Blight threat has grown and its attacks against advanced races and other Powers continued, this instability has increased. Could there not be some connection?

Furthermore, the other posters put its epicenter less than 6,000 light-years from recent warfare related to the Blight. Can this be mere coincidence? As has long been theorized [citations from various sources, three known to Ølvira ; the theories cited are of long standing and nondisprovable] the Zones themselves may be an artifact, perhaps created by something beyond Transcendance for the protection of lesser forms, or [hypothetical] sentient gas clouds in galactic cores. Now for the first time in Net history we have a Transcendent form, the Blight, that can effectively dominate the Beyond. Many on the Net [cites Hanse and Sandor at the Zoo] believe that it is searching for an artifact near the Bottom.

I wonder what would have happened if Ravna had just read a little further. In some weird way, Twirlip knows the Secret of the Riders. I wonder how many people will catch this. It's really not up to the level of a legitimate clue (I didn't notice it until after I wrote it) — but if it were, Ravna would have instantly caught on to it. This is a special case of something you might use elsewhere: Even though the Known Net has enormous connectivity, the interests of the participants and the prejudices of the newsfilter software would tend to create virtual partitions. There could be large segments that, sometimes unknowingly, are ignoring each other. Most of the time this would just improve efficiency; in some cases great insights would be lost. (Hence, I bet some people or their automation would expend lots of effort dredging the unintelligible. Even that would not eliminate the problem.)</p><p>Note 1165 1. Twirlip priors: file 13, speculation based on human hexapodia file 15, speculation that Zone instab is connected to the Blighter threat. Twirlip may know all the big secrets, but it's just too strange for credible translations — hence its permanent crank status throughout this story.</p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
