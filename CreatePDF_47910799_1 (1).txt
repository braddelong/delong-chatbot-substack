It is not at all clear that one would actually want to attend the Blackstock College of Pamela

better approximations to the Platonic Idea of College, or a better setting for Story?

First: The 1970s Are a Very Bad Analogy for Today:

Philipp Hildebrand is talking his book. And it is a very good book to talk.

Philipp Hildebrand: The Old Inflation Playbook No Longer Applies: a€~The debate about how 
a€cetransitorya€D inflation would end up being missed the point. The root cause of this rise is 
more importanta€!. Post-pandemic inflation surge is not principally being driven by excessive 
demand but by limits on supply capacitya€!. First, there are economy-wide constraints. In the 
restart of activity after
lockdowns it proved harder to bring supply capacity on stream than for demand to restart. Even more 
important has been a second sort of misfiring: supply capacity was in the wrong placea€!. We 
therefore find ourselves in a fundamentally different situation from the one Paul Volcker faced 
when he became chair of the US Federal Reserve in 1979. Then, the economy was running hot and the 
aim was
to drive inflation that had become embedded out of the system. But this is not a Volcker momenta€L 
When inflation is driven by demand, judicious policy can in principle stabilise both inflation and 
growth. This is not possible in a world where inflation is the result of supply constraints. 
Heightened macro volatility becomes inevitable. Central banks have either to accept higher 
inflation or be prepared
literally to destroy demand across the whole economy to ease supply constraints in one part of 
ita€!

Back in the 1970s we knew what the structural-adjustment problem was. The two triplings of oil 
prices, in 1973 and 1979, meant that everything energy intensive had the relative price structure 
strongly tilted against it. There was not a great deal of price discovery to be done: simply take 
the energy intensity of an activity and multiply it by nine, and you get with the new equilibrium 
real price of it was going to be.

The problem in that 1970s was that an expectation that wage inflation next year would be about what 
wage inflation had been this year, perhaps a percentage point per year or so more, also got 
embedded in the economy. But that embedding came with no countervailing information flow in terms 
of price discovery about the true real costs of energy intensive activities. We already knew what 
OPEC had done, and what its
consequences were going to be.

Our problem today is considerably different. We are wheeling the structure of our economy in a 
number of different directions with remarkable speed. And there is no sufficient statistic for what 
the new real equilibrium prices are going to be in the same way that black gold delivered in 
Cushing, Oklahoma was a sufficient statistic back in The Day. Thus we need to see where the 
bottlenecks are, and those bottlenecks need to
move prices in order to incentivize people to correct them. What we do not want to do is squeeze 
down on economic production in general so that the bottlenecks go away. That would produce low 
inflation, true. That would also produce low production. And that would keep us from undertaking 
the von Hayekian price discovery that the economy needs to learn as fast as possible.

And, with good luck, and with a Federal Reserve able to manage expectations of its own future 
actions, we can do this with just a one time step-up of the price level, and not get expectations 
of continual year-after-year wage inflation in bedded in the expectational and contracting 
structures of the economy.

Fully-vaccinated people have received all

doses prescribed by the initial vaccination protocol. The mortality rate for the 'All ages' group 
is age-standardized to account for the different
vaccination rates of older and younger people.
