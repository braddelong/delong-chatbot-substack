Hussman saying to me, repeatedly, “Well, Joe, you and I are both reporters…” or “Well, since we’re both journalists I think you understand…” This is a common rhetorical device. Find an area of common ground, assert affinity, create a bond…. After journalism and business school, Hussman was briefly a reporter before, at age 27, he was made publisher of a paper in the family media dynasty he would go on to inherit. When I was 27 years old I was a beat reporter on a daily newspaper going to fires, murder scenes, protests and government meetings. I practically slept in the newsroom, which was much nicer than my apartment, and took side gigs to afford to sleep indoors and eat while reporting. That sort of experience—slowly clawing your way up from smaller to larger newsrooms, being mentored by veteran reporters, slowly earning bigger beats and more responsibility over many years—is what I’m supposed to assume I share with someone who says “I was a reporter.” Those are, as it happens, experiences I do share with Nikole Hannah-Jones…. Neither of us were, in our mid twenties, handed news outlets by our families. Neither of us were allowed to lose enormous amounts of money in years-long, heavily political newspaper wars until we crushed our rivals, assumed dominance and expanded our intergenerational empires. I suspected this may be one of the things that most offended Hannah-Jones about Hussman questioning her media values and credentials, whether she was fit to teach young journalists. And my interview with her confirmed it…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/JoekillianPW/status/1412388863985819653">https://twitter.com/JoekillianPW/status/1412388863985819653</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Given that we have undershot our inflation target by a cumulative 10% over the past decade—by something like 0.8%/year—it seems likely that a 3% inflation target would produce 2.2% average inflation:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Jason Furman</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Interview with Noah Smith</em>: ‘There is a better possibility… that we will have a few years of inflation well above 2 percent. If this happens… at its next framework review about four years from now it could end up ratifying reality with a higher inflation target like a 2 to 3 percent range or 3 percent inflation. So far the bond markets and professional forecasters are giving very little weight to this possibility and expect them to keep inflation to 2 percent over the longer term. I’m much less sure and place at least a 20 percent chance of a higher inflation target, but possibly that is wishful thinking on my part because I would like them to raise the inflation target… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/interview-jason-furman-former-chair">https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/interview-jason-furman-former-chair</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Short-run dopamine loops have their proper place, but need to be kept in their proper place:</p><blockquote><p><strong>John Ganz</strong>:&nbsp;<em>It’s Really Not That Bad… Right?</em>: ‘I’m sure a healthy and normal person can go on Twitter for an hour or so, see what’s going on, and then log off and go about their day.

This relation of the worker to his own activity as an alien activity not belonging to himself; it is activity as suffering, strength as weakness, begetting as emasculating, the worker’s own physical and mental energy….

England was just late to take advantage—a century behind Spain and Portugal. (And, yes, some ramping-up of invention and innovation in Europe as well.) And, no, I don’t think it had much to do with “institutions” or the Glorious Revolution: those had powerful impacts later on (and earlier on as well, if you buy DeLong &amp; Shleifer: <em>Princes &amp; Merchants</em>).</p><p>The puzzle I see here is: why no rapid demographic expansion with population rapidly recovering from the Black Death nadir? Nutrition levels look very good, and equivalent real wages in the 1800s saw very rapid demographic expansion. Are builders unrepresentative of peasants (that free builders are able to bargain for high wages given their high productivity as a result of resource abundance does not mean that it was easy for the marginal peasant to do so)? Was the disease environment simply so poisonous? Paul Bouscasse, Emi Nakamura, and Jón Steinsson are working on this, I know, and—lo and behold: they have a new draft, which is something else I must now find time to read &lt;<a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~jsteinsson/papers/malthus.pdf">https://eml.berkeley.edu/~jsteinsson/papers/malthus.pdf</a>&gt;:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Gregory Clark</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Condition of the Working-Class in England, 1209–2003</em>: ‘Real wages of male building craftsmen and laborers in England for 1209–2003… implications for our understanding of both the Malthusian era, and of the Industrial Revolution…. From 1200 until 1800 there was no trend increase in real wages…. Modern economic growth, fuelled by productivity advance, probably began in the seventeenth century before the institutional reforms of the Glorious Revolution of 1688…. Human capital interpretations of the Industrial Revolution, formalized by Becker et al. (1990), Galor and Weil (2000) and Lucas (2002), as presently constructed, conflict with the empirical record.
