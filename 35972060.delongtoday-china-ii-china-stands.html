China’s growth has created three Chinas—the Spain-level 60-million megacity growth poles, which also possess the world’s second-leading high-tech economy; the Poland-level 300-million coastal economy, which is the world’s largest export manufacturing mechine ever (and which is mostly integrated with the rest of the world much more than with China’s interior), and the Peru-level one-billion interior economy, whose performance has been very good by global-south standards but sub-par by Pacific Rim standards.</p><p>2. All-in-all, China—coastal China—has managed to grow about as fast as one would expect given (i) when it started its reform process, and (ii) that it is located on the Pacific Rim.</p><p>3. China managed to grow at a Pacific Rim pace by stepping away from really-existing socialism-style planning and implementing a market economy.</p><p>4. China accomplished this in seven stages: (i) rural de-communization, (ii) growth of TVEs, (iii) urban retail decontrol, (iv) successfully dismantling the SOEs, (v) the great rural interior-urban coast migration, (vi) housing privatization, and (vii) the WTO-undervalued RMB-export manufacturing push.</p><p>5. Last takeaway from last time: This was not at all easy. Other countries that attempted to transition to a market economy—to “step away from the plan”—suffered a decade-long depression, underwent enormous political turmoil, and ended with a system that was substantially dysfunctional both in its political and its economic aspects. China managed it.</p><p>Let me stress that: China managed it. “Stepping Away from the Plan” was not easy. In the former Soviet bloc to China’s east moving to a market economy was hellish. It took a deep decade-long depression to do it. And even afterwards it left societies that were deeply wounded economically—and politically. Politically, far too many of the former Soviet bloc’s ex-planned economies are fascist or fascist-adjacent. Economically, they lack much dynamism—Poland is doing best, and Poland is eworking only as a cheap labor soure for Germany’s Weltexportmeister economy.</p><p>How did China manage to grow enormously during the process of creating a market economy—a process that was a horrific disaster in the USSR and in much of the rest of eastern Europe? It required government economic management, and very skillful government economic management.</p><p>Thus when someone—even someone as brilliant and as incredibly knowledgeable as UCSD’s Barry Naughton says that China over 1978-2006 was not a “developmental state” because all it was doing was building a market economy from scratch—and doing so with nothing, with neither bricks nor straw—my reaction is not terribly favorable. That seems to me to miss the point. It is much easier to focus inventive and entrepreneurial effort in sectors with large positive market externalities in a functioning market economy—what the other Pacific Rim “developmental states” did—than to build one from scratch, all the while providing the ruling bureaucrats and cadres with incentives for cooperating in the “stepping away from the plan”. China did so with its use of TVEs, which was a policy of political-economy genius. And yet they also, somehow, managed to keep valuable state-owned assets from being tunneled out into the control of oligarchs. They dealt with the dismantling of the state-owned sector without causing horrific social discontent from its stakeholders as they lost position, stability, and income. And—most important from the CCP’s point-of-view—they somehow maintained the leading role of the CCP, something that very few would have thought could survive the stresses of successful rapid economic growth (or, indeed, of unsuccessful rapid economic growth).</p><p>Moreover, the market economy that China managed to build was a successful one—a Pacific-Rim class one, rather than one like those of Latin America or Africa. Let us remind ourselves why the Pacific Rim economies have done so well—a happy coincidence of cultural, political, political economy, and economic factors. First was the relative absence of landlords: an entrenched non-entrepreneurial upper class with wealth based on assets—a class whose dominance might well be threatened by economic growth, and that viewed society as a whole as a sheep to be sheered. Closely connected was the presence of an at least semi-honest, and, important, competent bureaucracy. But it needs more: a bureaucracy that shares with the nation an agreed-on image of the future, and shares a sense of national purpose that a prosperous and productive country is the common goal.</p><p>Then it is not hard to see what is to be done with respect to industrial development: the richer countries of the world provide a target. And it is not that hard to see how it is to be done—simply copy what they did, leap-frogging where possible. And it is virtually certain that—if it can be accomplished—it will be very profitable.</p><p>Infrastructure—investing in buildings, machines, and people. (A cultural tradition that values education helps a lot.) Resource mobilization—much of it building the cities and the housing so people can move from the farm to the factory, plus creating the channels for savings and then for savings to be transformed into investment. (A long-lasting tradition of functional bureaucracy helps a lot.) Then there are the “industrial policy” concerns: how to nurture and grow communities of engineering practice, how to select and support firms that should grow—success at exporting, thus using the middle classes of richer countries as a quality-control mechanism, has provided reliable). An undervalued exchange rate and global-north markets open to your exports may well be the best of all industrial policies. Judicious controls to ensure that foreign exchange to invest for the future rather than boost elite consumption in the present, thus wresting substantial control over resource allocation away from those the market usually gives it to—the rich, who want to consume luxuries, especially high-status foreign-made luxuries.</p><p>The amazing thing about China is that it succeeded in matching the rest of the Pacific Rim. It succeeded in doing this while suspended in mid-air—without the market-economy underpinnings already in place, but managing to build the market-ecopnomy underpinnings, each stage just in time.</p><p>There is, however, a caveat: it did not match the other Pacific-Rim economies—not really. The 1B people of poor China had a decade-long headstart on Vietnam’s doi moi market reform program. And yet they have not gained vis-a-vis Vietnam at all since 1980. Admittedly, there are poor parts of Vietnam as well. And Poor China has done much to catch up to, say, the slow-growing Philippines. But there are a billion people in China who live in regions that, while much more prosperous than their predecessors were back in the late 1970s, are not any sort of growth miracle. Plus there is the dire condition of Manchuria, which was in the 1950s the heart of the centrally-planned industrialization push.</p><p>As economist Nancy Qian points out, success at spurring growth for the billion people in the regions of the interior is of vital importance for the regime: “The Chinese government… will be preoccupied for at least another generation by the need to increase domestic incomes…” And this is, I think, a major source of Xi Jinping’s push for “dual circulation”—to keep the export machine running, while redirecting as much of the wealth it generates to the interior as can be possibly done. This, too, will be a very difficult task.</p><p>The fact that China’s coast is now so much richer than the interior is one major reason that the Xi Jinping government feels it has to play the nationalism card—not just protecting China against natural disasters, but the claim that India and Southeast Asian countries objecting to China’s reinterpretation of international land and sea boundaries are a new colonialism.</p><p>Coastal China, however—the coastal regions outside the major growth poles, together some 300 million—have matched the pace. Coastal China has not yet seen any middle-income slowdown. Coastal China has, I think, now caught up with Thailand—and is growing significantly faster than Malaysia was when Malaysia was at Coastal China’s current level of income. But the Four Tigers and the heyday of Japanese growth? Those are things that Coastal China has not quite been able to match…</p><p>And then there is Growth Pole China: the Lower Pearl River, Shanghai, and Beijing—extraordinarily rich because of the extraordinary regional concentration of wealth in China. What is its real per capita income? Perhaps it is roughly equal to that of the U.S. in the early 1970s. Certainly it looks much richer than Japan looked back then, at the time of the “Nixon Shock” that triggered the first of Japan’s two major economic gorwth slowdowns. Yet so far there is no sign of such a middle-income slowdown in China’s three growth poles. And there is not even a slowdown like that of Taiwan island and South Korea after the 1998 East Asian financial crisis</p><p>It is against this background that, starting in 2005-2010, China began to reassert state guidance and state control over the economy: the government felt that it needed to do more than manage decontrol and promote exports. The theory is clear: where there are substantial externalities—in the nurturing of communities of engineering practice, say—the competitive market will systematically get prices “wrong”. And where there are strategic complementarities, only the government can elicit the confidence in A that B will make the investments that will make A’s business model profitable and also at the same time that A will make the investments that will make B’s business model profitable. China’s 2006 “Megaprojects” were an attempt to move beyond simple decontrol and export promotion and do standard Pacific-Rim catchup industrial policy.</p><p>But then around 2010 things change bigtime. As Barry Naughton points out in his very new and very good short book, _The Rise of China’s Industrial Policy_: “Since about 2010… the volume of resources the Chinese state invests in targeted sectors has been much greater than anything [in] Japan or Korea.” And the nature of the targetting is different: Japan and Korea when they were middle-income economies were playing catchup. Now China appears to think that it can play leap-frog. </p><p>Why this shift around 2010? First, and I think most important, there was no obvious next pro-market reform to undertake. And yet the government is bureaucratically programmed at a deep level to set big goals and pursue them. Add to this the fact that the Great Recession hit in 2008. The Chinese government made the correct, Keynesian diagnosis that continued prosperity required that the governmetn spend money on something. And they found that having the government take control of and maintain the economy-wide spending flow works—worked much better than the destructive austerity policies of Europe and of America’s Republican Party. Moreover, they found that having the government exercise command-and-control over the banks works—rather than let them stampede for the exits, as both American and European regulators did, and so trigger fire-sale collapses in asset prices.</p><p>China came out of the Great Recession with great confidence in the technocratic competence and power of its government—certainly much better than the clowns of the North Atlantic. The next natural question was: What else can government do that works? Plus the failure of the global north to handle the Great Recession removed any belief in China that further “convergence” of China’s economic structure toward that of global north-style “neoliberalism” was an attractive goal.</p><p>And then add on to this scientific-bureaucratic-technocratic discontent at the idea that China, as a low-middle-income country, should “stay in its lane”. At least as Barry Naughton interprets China’s Innovation-Driven Development Strategy, it is based on a consensus belief among China’s engineering governors that China righ tnow has a once-in-a-century opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a technological revolution—revolutionary new technologies that are intelligent and ubiquitous in communication, data, and artificial intelligence, a technological shift that is so disruptive that it is a positive disadvantage to have successfully implented earlier stages. In Chinese thought, global-north success at Industry 3.0 will hobble their ability to implement Industry 4.0, and gives China the opportunity to leapfrog: with the largest mobile internet market, with 5G’s ability to create very low-latency local networks, artificial intelligence ot make sense of what sensors produce—we are talking about the potential not just for intelligent machines but intelligent factories.</p><p>In short, as Naughton interprets it, the belief in China is that a new General Purpose technology is there to be grasped, in which China’s relative backwardness is, as Thorstein Veblen and Alexander Gerschenkron had thought was and had been the case with Imperial Germany’s rapid overtaking and surpassing of Great Britain at the end of the 1800s. There are no powerful entrenched incumbents “occupying the commanding heights of the technology revolution”… in the Industry 4.0 vision that is targeted by China’s Innovation-Driven Development Strategy—or that, at least, is the plan. </p><p>Adding to this is a perceived U.S. declaration of technological war against China. Back in the 1950s the founders of what was to become the European Union strove to make the economies of western Europe so interdependent that they would never dare wage war against each other—it would just be too expensive to break the links to prepare. But, in China’s perception, the U.S. has, as Abe Newman and Henry Farrell would term it, “weaponized interdependence”—have decided to use interdependence to kneecap Chinese companies like Huawei. As Dan Wang reports, China’s rulers see “a relentless pace of US actions targeting Chinese companies has delivered unmistakable setbacks to their operations…” The resutl has been to align the interests of China’s leading tech companies with the state’s interest in self-sufficiency and technological greatness. The U.S. under Trump has thus triggered a “Sputnik moment” in China—a willingness of the state to spend without counting the cost to acquire technologies of its own so that it will never again be dependent to any meaningful extent on higher-level technology from outside.</p><p>This is clearest in artificial intelligence. Yes, Google in California is the global leader. Yes, it requires specialized chips—“neural engines”. But advances in machine learning have steadily democratized the field. There are few barriers to new entrants.</p><p>It looks as though China will deploy $2T US in purchasing power in this technological-leapfrog attempt. Upstream, China needs to make huge heavy lifts to create sources of server chips, desktop chips, and communications chips that the U.S. cannot strangle. That means investing in “fabs”, which now cost $10B US each _if nothing goes wrong_ to build something that can manufacture chips at the technological frontier. Right now pretty much only TSMC, Samsung, and Intel can—and Intel is having problems maintaining the pace. Further upstream are those who do not manufacture but design the chips: Intel (again), the ARM consortia, now Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung—and Huawei was getting into the game before the U.S. kneecapped it with sanctions. </p><p>Moreover in all of this the U.S. may well be looking and moving in the wrong direction. To quote Dan Wang again, he sees: “A marketing trick that California pulled off to situate consumer internet as the highest form of technology, as if Tencent and Facebook are the surest signs that we live a technologically-accelerating civilization. The ‘tech’ giants are highly-capable companies that print cash. But they’re barely engaged in the creation of intellectual property, excelling instead on business-model innovation and the exploitation of network effects…” Getting very, very good indeed at figuring out how to glue people’s eyeballs to the screen through fear or clickbait so that you can sell them ads does not lead to global future technological supremacy.</p><p>To back up, what does the Chinese government think it is doing? It says that it is building Socialism with Chinese Characteristics. But it knows damned well that is not what it is doing. It is instead, building Authoritarian State Surveillance Capitalism with Egalitarian Aspirations</p><p>In this task, the Chinese government thinks:</p><p>* It has absolutely nothing to learn from the United States—as GFC, Great Recession, anemic recovery, Trump, disinformation epidemic, coronavirus shows. The United States is a society in decline, living off of accumulated capital</p><p>* It controls the most magnificent and profitable export machine the world has ever seen. But the purpose of the export machine is not profit—not to maximize profit by China’s slotting itself into the export-machine slot in the global division of labor</p><p>* The purpose of the export machine, rather, is to gain access to technology from value-chain partners and to gain worker and engineering experience to attain technological parity</p><p>* From that point, the CCP thinks, China’s societal superiority—plus its sheer size in an increasing-returns world, plus the CCP’s ability to mobilize resoruces for investment, plus the focus of global-north companies and governments on the short run and short-run profits only—will lead in a generation to Chinese technological supremacy</p><p>And after that, the CCP will lead humanity forward into the sunlit uplands of utopia. What form will that “utopia” take in the eyes of Xi Jinping and his successors?</p><p>* It will be a more egalitarian society than China today</p><p>* But it will still be under tight control from the CCP</p><p>* The CCP will need to control personnel and propaganda so that:</p><p>    * Egalitarian norms are respected and encouraged—perhaps there will be oligarchs and plutocrats, but they will be kept in their place and allowed by the party to flourish only as long as their enterprises are useful and focused, and as they recognize that they are servants of the party, and not independent powerbrokers</p><p>    * Policy remains technocratic—no botches like the global north’s failed handling of COVID-19, or of the Great Recession</p><p>    * Technological progress remains rapid.</p><p>And, most important of all, in Xi Jinping’s eyes, the CCP can only be the vanguard of humanity if the CCP is more than a bunch of corrupt bureaucrats uneasily sitting atop the pyramid of society. Hence the need to use propaganda to create centralized campaigns of inspiration—to focus effort on national economic uplift, to continually recall the CCP to its egalitarian, utopian origins, and to keep the members of the CCP conscious that they are a unified force rather than a collection of people who have climbed to the top of a bureaucratic heap so that they can give a handup to their familial and patronage networks. Avoiding the downfall into complacency and decadence will be very difficult. To do so needs tight central control of personnel and promotion from the center, and needs commitment by the center not to a comfortable bureaucratic life—not to late-Brezhnevism—but rather to the revolutionary utopian transformation of humanity.</p><p>And, of course, it is most important of all to firmly repress those who seek to remove the CCP from its vanguard role—that way lies decadence and incompetence, like the United States today. Nobody in China would want to see a Donald Trump in the place where Xi Jinping is now. So far it is going well: the CCP treated a great many of its finest cadres very cruelly during the Cultural Revolution, yet the thought that the party was at fault—rather than, say, the Gang of Four—is firmly repressed, apparently even among the victims. </p><p>It could work: China and the CCP handled the Tienenman Square protest crisis of 1990, reform-restart in 1992, 1998, 2008, &amp; 2020: it is effective and powerful. As long as the General Secretary remains minimally corrupt, key personnel decisions will put people who share the General Secretariat’s vision in the drivers’ seats. And, as I said before, nobody in China wants China to become more like America any more—COVID, Trump, the Great Recession, and so forth put an end to any such aspirations</p><p>But I do not think that it is likely to work—at least not the way that Xi Jinping and his faction hope. I see a grave succession problem as the emperor ages. I see the control and information problems that always beset overplanning—and, no, near-ubiquitous surveillance will not help. I see a very powerful incentivization problem as well. When power controls and can threaten wealth, those who would otherwise be entrepreneurial will become focused on acquring power which can protect itself rather than wealth which cannot, and growth will slow.</p><p>Plus the Chinese government thinks that it needs to be visibly eeking a “place in the sun”—perhaps to give the 1B in “Poor China” a feeling that they are winners too from China’s growth and power. But as pre-WWI Germany found, such growth provokes reactions. Disputes can turn into cold wars, and cold wars can get hot. Plus China may not recognize the degree to which the unweaponized interdependence between the U.S., Japan, South Korea, &amp; Taiwan means that the U.S. “vital interests” security perimeter runs through the Taiwan Strait and along the 38th Parellel. The chances of major miscalculation are much too high.</p><p>On the other hand: There are 60M people in the “growth poles”. That is a European country-sized power on its own. And then are 1.3B people outside the growth poles who can be included. Migration can add scale. Education can add energy. Investment—especially in ideas—empowers the future. And China is certainly investing in a way that reduces the current generation’s standard of living much more than it accelerates growth. But it does add to growth. Plus the scale of China’s domestic market, should the poorer regions of China with their 1B people manage to join the global middle class will give its government the ability to dictate terms: Your technology in exchange for market access.</p><p>So that, at least, is how I think the way it is. Next time I will—finally—turn to trying to assess how the U.S. should engage with China.</p><p>This is Brad DeLong’s DeLongTODAY briefing.
