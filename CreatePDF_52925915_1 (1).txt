GERMANY ENTERS THE THIRD REICH, by Calvin B. Hoovera€L

THE BROWN BOOK OF THE HITLER TERROR AND THE BURNING OF THE REICHSTAG, prepared by the World 
Committee for the Victims of German Fascism

I LIST a few of the first-comers among what promises to be a long procession of Hitler books. We 
are in for a great flood of them, like the flood of Russian books two or three years ago. At the 
time these lines are written Hitler has just flung his defiance to the world, and no man can say 
what his position may be by the time they come into print. On the one hand, he may have forced 
France and England into something resembling acquiescence in his demands,
though they will never, of course, admit categorically that they have yielded; and on the other 
hand, they may be preparing to dislodge him by force, and have even proceeded to do so. But 
whatever the issue, it must be manifest that he has given Europe its greatest scare since the 
Bolsheviki reached the gates of Warsaw in 1920, and that the newspapers will print many a black 
headline before the debate over him is ended, and he sinks at last into the gray gloom
of exploded and forgotten politicians.

The most surprising thing about him, it seems to me, is that his emergence should have been 
surprising. He was, in fact, implicit in the Treaty of Versailles, and, indeed, in what passed, 
toward the end of the war, as the Alliesa€™ statement of war aims. The underlying purpose of the 
whole uproar, we were told, was to heave out the Hohenzollerns, and give the German people the 
great boon of democratic government. There was no sign that any considerable
portion of them longed for it, but nevertheless it was to be given to them.

Ostensibly, the aim here was purely philanthropic: the Germans were to be lifted up in spite of 
themselves. But under that lofty purpose there lurked a scarcely concealed desire to make and keep 
them weak, and it was generally believed that both birds might be brought down with the same stone. 
The old imperial army, though it had been beaten at last, had held out against all the rest of 
Europe for four long years, and the evidences of its appalling prowess were
on every side. No one wanted another doseout of the same bottle, and it was felt that a good way to 
avoid it would be to turn out the undivided and highly military Hohenzollerns and set up a gang of 
democratic politicians, who could be trusted to spend most of their time and energy fighting one 
another, and so have little left for the external foes of their country.

This was wise reasoning so far as it went, but unfortunately it overlooked some unpleasant 
corollaries. The politicians who began practise in Berlin actually behaved, at least for eight or 
ten years, precisely as the Allied metaphysicians had expected. That is, they devoted themselves 
wholeheartedly to getting and keeping jobs for themselves and their friends, and were willing to 
make almost any imaginable sacrifice of their countrya€™ s interest to that end. They
agreed to the Dawes Plan, the Young Plan and a dozen other such fine schemes, all of them designed 
to keep Germany bankrupt and impotent.

They were quite willing, on the one hand, to ruin German capital, and on the other hand, to enslave 
German labor, if only they and their gangs could continue in office thereby. When, as and if any 
German protested he was proceeded against with great vigor by the Polizei, and if he proceeded from 
talk to acts he was denounced to the common enemy, and in not a few cases actually put in the way 
of losing his life. Meanwhile, these stupid and often knavish
politicos were depicted in the Allied and American press as great statesmen, and the fact was 
conveniently overlooked that a huge gulf was beginning to yawn between the German government and 
the German people.

The situation became so unendurable a year or two ago that even the Allied diplomats, an 
extraordinarily stupid class of men, began to realize that if it were not relieved there would be 
an explosion. Accordingly, certain concessions to the realities began to be made. Unfortunately, 
they were made grudgingly and did not go far enough; worse, they were arrived at after open and 
often raucous debate, so that everyone, including the more intelligent Germans, could
see plainly that there was little honest good-will in them, but mainly only the yearning of England 
to get ahead of France, or vice versa, or the desire of Mussolini to shine as a world statesman. As 
for the common people in Germany, they began to despair. The prevailing politicians, at best, were 
only too plainly duffers, and it began to be obvious that the country would go to pot if they 
continued in power.

The German masses were thus ripe for demagogues, and the preaching of new and revolutionary arcana. 
Both appeared promptly, for both had been in waiting since the first dreadful years after the war. 
There were two gangs of these demagogues. The one preached Communism and the other a kind of 
Fascism. Each promised, if put into power, to proceed at once to the elimination of the other. The 
Communists, with the horrible writhings of Russia so close and
so full of warning, found it impossible to convince any considerable number of sensible men, but 
they made good progress among university innocents of the type of our own Brain Trust, and they 
found it easy to round up millions of recruits among the proletariat, which had nothing to lose but 
its chains.

The Fascists appealed rather to the middle class, which had been ruined once by the Berlin 
politicians and was in fear of being ruined again. They made but little more impression on the 
enlightened minority than the Communists, but what they proposed was at least less cannibalistic 
than Communism, and most of them, at the worst, were at any rate Germans, so they began to gather 
support in the upper income brackets, and to enjoy the advantages that go with

The German masses were thus ripe for demagogues, and the preaching of new and revolutionary arcana. 
Both appeared promptly, for both had been in waiting since the first dreadful years after the war. 
There were two gangs of these demagogues. The one preached Communism and the other a kind of 
Fascism. Each promised, if put into power, to proceed at once to the elimination of the other. The 
Communists, with the horrible writhings of Russia so close and
so full of warning, found it impossible to convince any considerable number of sensible men, but 
they made good progress among university innocents of the type of our own Brain Trust, and they 
found it easy to round up millions of recruits among the proletariat, which had nothing to lose but 
its chains.

The Fascists appealed rather to the middle class, which had been ruined once by the Berlin 
politicians and was in fear of being ruined again. They made but little more impression on the 
enlightened minority than the Communists, but what they proposed was at least less cannibalistic 
than Communism, and most of them, at the worst, were at any rate Germans, so they began to gather 
support in the upper income brackets, and to enjoy the advantages that go with
having money to pay for newspapers, parades and brass bands.

The ensuing combat was depicted by most of the American correspondents resident in Berlin as a low 
comedy comparable to one of our own presidential campaigns, and few of them believed that either 
the Communists or the Fascists would fetch the great body of non-political and naturally 
conservative Germans, most of whom, and especially the farmers, had a certain nostalgia for the 
Hohenzollerns, and were eager only to be let alone, that they might work
hard and reaccumulate the capital wasted by the war, the subsequent inflation, and the pestilence 
of politicians. Many of these correspondents apparently believed that the Communists had the better 
of it; I can recall only one who predicted formally that the Fascists would really attain to power. 
The rest overlooked two things. The first was that the Fascists had much more money than the 
Communists, and could thus give a better show. The second was that they
had developed in one Adolf Hitler, an obscure Austrian, a demagogic rhetorician of the first 
calibre-indeed, a fit match for either William Jennings Bryan or David Lloyd George, or for the two 
taken together.

This Hitler began modestly, and for a long while was a very minor figure in German politics. Down 
to 1923, when he got involved in some riots instigated by General Ludendorff and was jailed for a 
few months, he was scarcely heard of outside Bavaria. His political ideas, at that time, were 
somewhat vague. He had started out in Vienna as a Socialist enemy of the Hapsburg, but had 
afterward shopped around among the small and often preposterous minor
parties that arose in Germany after the war. Put up to speak, from time to time, for these 
discordant causes, he discovered an extraordinary talent as a mob orator, and was soon, as he 
himself says in a€oeMy Battle,a€D a€oea master of this craft.a€D It was a common feat for him to 
face a hostile audience of three or four thousand, and bring it galloping to the mournera€™ s bench 
in an hour. German politics, in those days as in these, ran to roughhouse, and
Hitler did not disdain the protection of strong-arm men, but three times out of four he really 
didna€™ t need it. He achieved on one occasion the impressive feat of talking down a hall full of 
Communists: many of them, in fact, rushed up to join him at the end, though neither he nor they 
knew where he was headed.

It is easy to see from Hitlera€™ s book that he is anything but a political philosopher. What he 
says in it is often sensible enougha€”for example, when he argues that Germanya€™ s first big task 
is to collar Austria and so consolidate the German people, and again when he argues that its 
natural route of expansion is along the Baltic, and yet again when he argues that it can never hope 
to make an honest friend of Francea€”but always it has an air of second hand.
In this it greatly resembles Bryana€™ s a€oeThe First Battle,a€D another effort by a mob orator to 
make effective rhetoric of the ideas of other men.

Hitler was tutored as he went along by various theorists, but he quickly translated their theories 
into catch-words of his own, and he is quite as far from some of them today as Stalin is from 
Trotzky or Roosevelt from Moley. As an orator he is incomparable, at least in Germany. England may 
have his match in Lloyd George, as we had his match in Bryan, but the Germans have not seen his 
like in modern times. It is thus no wonder that they wallow in his terrific
eloquence, and forget to notice that what he says is often absurd.

His anti-Semitism, which has shocked so many Americans, is certainly nothing to marvel over. 
Anti-Semitism is latent all over Western Europe, as it is in the United States, and whenever there 
are public turmoils and threats of public perils it tends to flare up, as it did in France in 1804, 
when the French feared a new Franco-German war, and in Austria during the lunatic days following 
the war. The disadvantage of the Jew is that, to simple men, he always seems
a kind of foreigner. He practises a religion that is not common, he has customs that seem strange 
to the general, and only too often he indulges imprudently in talk about going back to his own 
country some day, and reviving the power and glory of his forefathers. He is commonly a fierce 
patriot in whatever land he lives in, and he certainly was, at least in most cases, in Germany 
during the war, but his patriotism is always ameliorated, despite its excess, by a
touch of international-mindedness born of his history, and in consequence he is commonly held 
suspect by patriots who cana€™ t see beyond their own frontiers. Thus he is an easy mark for 
demagogues when the common people are uneasy, and it is useful to find a goat.

He has served as such a goat a hundred times in the past, and he will probably continue in the 
rATe, off and on, until his racial differentiation disappears or he actually goes back to his 
fatherland. In Germany, as in Poland, Austria and France, he has been made use of by demagogues for 
many years, precisely as the colored brother has been made use of in our own South.

But at the time Hitler began to prowl the land the Jew was suspect in Germany for another reason, 
to wit, his entanglement with Bolshevism. This entanglement, in large part, was imaginary, and at 
best it was much exaggerated, but nevertheless it had some reality, at least in the plain mana€™ s 
eye. There were plenty of Jews among the Moscow master-minds, and they had proved their puissance 
by  putting down Jew-baiting in Russia, for long the chief field
sport of the Christian masses there. Moreover, the bloody RAPterepublik at Municha€“long forgotten 
elsewhere, but only too well remembered in Germanya€”had been set up and bossed by a Jew, and there 
were other Jews high in the councils of the Communist party, which proposed openly to repeat the 
Munich pillages and butcheries all over the country. It was thus easy for Hitler to convince his  
customers that there was perilin Israel, and in the end  he
managed to convince the more credulous of them that even the Jewish bankers, judges, doctors and 
store-keepers of Berlin were suspicious characters, though actually nine-tenths of them were quite 
as orthodox, politically speaking, as the men of their several classes in New York.

What followed was certainly not creditable to the German people, nor indeed to the human race in 
general. Once the paranoiacs on the lower levels were turned loose they proceeded instantly to 
extravagant barbarities, and the most innocent man, when he came under their fire, was no safer 
than the actually guilty. If Hitler had been able to confine the hunting to Communists there would 
have been no complaint in the United States and very little in England, for
the Communists openly condone the even worse brutalities that have gone on in Russia, and would 
repeat them all over the world if they had the means. But when the Brown Shirts began to harass and 
intimidate, flay and murder perfectly innocent and helpless people, some of them Jews but probably 
more of them Christians, and very few of them Communists, then the world was shocked indeed, and 
Hitler has now discovered that shocking it is a very serious
and dangerous business, with results not to be disposed of by oratory.

In such matters what is done cannot be undone; the main question, as I write, is how long the orgy 
will last, and whether it will wear itself out or have to be put down by external force. If the 
latter is resorted to, and it takes the form of military pressure, we are probably in for another 
World War, though it may not follow immediately. The Germans, of course, without adequate arms, 
could not resist the French, but once the French got across the Rhine it would be
difficult if not impossible for them to come back, and their presence there would inevitably set 
off a general conflagration.

A general boycott would not be as dangerous, but its effect, I think, would be to strengthen rather 
than weaken Hitler at home, where his theory of a huge conspiracy against Germany would begin to be 
believed in by millions who now doubt it. Moreover, such a boycott would be resisted elsewhere in 
the world, and here in the United States it might easily launch a formidable anti-Semitic movement, 
especially in view of the fact that many of the current Jewish
leaders in this country are very loud and brassy fellows, with an unhappy talent for making the 
Goyim Jew-conscious.

There remains the remedy of sober second thought. It can be relied on to cure even the wildest and 
wooliest of public manias soon or late, but unfortunately it takes time. That a majority of Germans 
will go on yielding to Hitler ad infinitum is hard to believe, and in fact downright incredible. 
Either he will have to change his programme so that it comes into reasonable accord with German 
tradition and the hard-won principia of modern civilization, or they will
rise against him and turn him out. He has the bayonets today and so he seems irresistible, but it 
is not to be forgotten that those same bayonets, on some near tomorrow, may be turned against him, 
and that he has only one throat to cut. Mussolini, to be sure, has lasted since 1922 and the 
Bolsheviks of Moscow since 1917. But I incline to think that the Germans are much less likely to 
follow Slav and Latin example in this matter than to stick to the ways of their
own blood.

Bryan, in all probability, was actually elected President of the United States in 1896, and yet by 
1904 he was already a comic character, and before he died his old huge following had shrunk to a 
feeble rabble of half-wits. Lloyd George was the sole and absolute proprietor of Great Britain in 
1919, but today he bosses only himself.

The Ku Klux Klan in 1920 had millions of members, could count upon close to a majority in Congress, 
and controlled at least twenty States, but by 1925 it was dispersed and impotent, and its Hitler 
was in jail. The American Legion ran amuck at about the same time, and somewhere in my files are at 
least twenty pounds of newspaper clippings describing the heroic mauling of unarmed and helpless 
persons, including many Jews, by its brave lads. Yet the Legion,
today, is simply a gang of professional pension-grabbers, and even politicians kick it about.
