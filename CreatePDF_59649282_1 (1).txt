SLOUCHING TOWARDS UTOPIA

J. BRADFORD DELONG

PREORDER NOW • ON SALE 6 SEPTEMBER

AJ 7, 8, & 9: Things changed starting around 1870. Then we got the institutions for organization 
and research and the technologiesa€”we got full globalization, the industrial research laboratory, 
and the modern corporation, [n] These were the keys. These unlocked the gate that had previously 
kept humanity in dire poverty. The problem of making humanity rich could now be posed to the market 
economy, because it now had a solution. On the other side of the
gate, the trail to utopia came into view. And everything else good should have followed from that.

Much good did follow from that.

My estimatea€”or perhaps my very crude personal guessa€”of the average worldwide pace of what is at 
the core of humanitya€™ s economic growth, the proportional rate of growth of my index of the value 
of the stock of useful ideas about manipulating nature and organizing humans that were discovered, 
developed, and deployed into the world economy, shot up from about 0.45 percent per year before 
1870 to 2.1 percent per year afterward, truly a

watershed-boundary crossing difference. A 2.1 percent average growth for the 140 years from 1870 to 
2010 is a multiplication by a factor of 21.5. That was very good: the growing power to create 
wealth and earn an income allowed humans to have more of the good things, the necessities, 
conveniences, and luxuries of life, and to better provide for themselves and their families. This 
does not mean that humanity in 2010 was 21.5 times as rich in material-welfare
terms as it had been in 1870: there were six times as many people in 2010 as there were in 1870, 
and the resulting increase in resource scarcity would take away from human living standards and 
labor-productivity levels. As a rough guess, average world income per capita in 2010 would be 8.8 
times what it was in 1870, meaning an average income per capita in 2010 of perhaps $11,000 per 
year. (To get the figure of 8.8, you divide 21.5 by the square root of 6.)
Hold these figures in your head as a very rough guide to the amount by which humanity was richer in 
2010 than it was in 1870a€”and never forget that the riches were vastly more unequally distributed 
around the globe in 2010 than they were in 1870.[6][o]

Longer Notes:

[n] There should be a chapter, or at least an essay, on the coming of the Second Industrial 
Revolution, its component pieces, and their impact. I regret I have not (yet) managed to write it. 
I observe the Global North and worldwide speedups in growth around 1870; I see the tremendous 
increase brought by modern full globalization in the incentives to discover, develop, deploy, and 
via copying the example of others diffuse the fruits of science and technology . I
observe the rationalization and routinization of the processes of discovery and development on the 
one hand and of development and deployment on the other brought by the coming of the industrial 
research lab and the modern corporation. But I have not yet found a good summary essay to point to.

[o] In the aggregate growth-modeling tradition that has developed from Robert Solow, a€oeA 
Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growtha€D, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 70, No. 1 
(Feb., 1956), pp. 65-94 <https://www.jstor.org/stable/1884513>, the level of real net output per 
worker Y/L, with Y for net output and L for the labor force, is a simple mathematical function of 
the capital-intensity of the economy K/Y, of how much of produced
means-of-production K per unit of net output there is assisting workers in creating that output per 
worker; and of the efficiency of labor E:

Y/L = (K/Y)A(aD7(l-an°)) E

Such an economy will tend to converge to a steady-state growth path in which the capital intensity 
K/Y approaches its steady-state value (K/Y)* given by:
(K/Y)A* = s/(n+g)


stresseda€”while there is reason to think that having people save a constant proportion of their 
net output is a reasonable baseline case to start from, there is no reason to think that people 
save a constant proportion of their gross outputa€”that net savings would be less in an 
otherwise-identical economy where capital equipment just happened to be less durable.)

The efficiency of labor E can then be thought of as a function of the level of knowledge about 
a€cetechnologya€D Ha€’’discovered, developed, and deployed ideas about manipulating nature and 
organizing humansa€”and of resources per worker R/L, where more resources per worker allow humans 
to be more productive, and where increasing resource scarcity leads to a fall in net output per 
worker Y/L unless there are countervailing improvements in
knowledge:

E = H (R/L)A^>

When natural resources are constanta€”as they are for the world economy as a whole, although not 
for individual sub civilizationsa€”this means that the proportional growth rate of the efficiency 
of labor is:

g = h - Ji>n

If we assume that the world economya€™ s steady-state capital-output ratio is constant across and 
within eras of economic growth, then the rate of growth of output per worker g_Y/L will be the same 
as the rate of growth of the efficiency of labor g. We can then read what the proportional rate of 
growth of knowledge about technology h from the rate of growth of average labor productivity and 
the rate of growth of the global labor force:
h = g_Y/L + ;E>n

I assume ?E>=l/2. Why? If yE>=0, we are assuming that resource scarcity is simply not a thing: that 
at a given level of technological knowledge standards of living are independent of how large 
average firms are and how many workers are drawing on the same metal deposits. If _/E>=l , we are 
assuming that labor is simply unproductive: that total output depends only on the level of 
technological knowledge H and the level of natural resources R, with a doubling of
the labor force leading to a halving of labor productivity. Both of those are clearly wrong. 
Halfway between seems to me a not-unreasonable baseline.

Alternative calculations are easy to do if you have a different sense of how important resource 
scarcity is as a binding or as a not-very-binding constraint on human economies.

There are near-consensus guesses as to the average level of net output per worker and the size of 
the human population since deep time. Under the further assumption that the effective labor force 
is a constant share of the human populationa€”that as the share of the population too young to work 
has fallen, the share that is retired has risen to approximately offseta€”the rate of labor-force 
growth is the same as the rate of population growth. And thus I can
calculate my guesstimates of the rate of growth of h.
