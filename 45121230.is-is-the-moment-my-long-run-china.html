But it has also seemed clear to me that the systemic and governance deficits of China would make successful continuation of that development model beyond a 10-year horizon very unlikely indeed. Thus I have, at every point in time, thought I saw clearly that the odds were that, within a decade in what was then the future, China would join the typical emerging-market economy, and find itself unable to make significant further progress in convergence toward the global north norm.<br><br>It is, of course, very clear and obvious that at each stage in the past I have been wrong. </p><p>China has, since 1980, at every point in time, not only had a successful short-run development model, but has also managed to avoid the factors that might bring its progress to a halt. It has been able to successfully rejigger its development model at each stage to continue economic progress.

This will involve state-owned entities taking Evergrande’s assets and liabilities at prices that will not require big losses to be recognised. The government’s goal is “to reach a balance between short-term stability and long-term reforms”, as Chaoping Zhu, of JPMorgan Asset Management, put it in the Financial Times today. Which is, if you think about it, what we’re all trying for in life, isn’t it? But this balance requires discipline, and there are a few signs that China might engage in a general easing of financial conditions, of the sort that encourages rather than discourages risk-taking, but which eases the short-term pain — and supports markets…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ad2be76-81aa-4735-a871-c3c6ac3e1fee">https://www.ft.com/content/0ad2be76-81aa-4735-a871-c3c6ac3e1fee</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/is-is-the-moment-my-long-run-china?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/is-is-the-moment-my-long-run-china?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Forthcoming September 6, 2022 from Basic:</h2><p><em>Slouching Towards Utopia: A History of the Long Twentieth Century</em>: <strong>Paragraph 3: </strong>My strong belief that history should focus on the long twentieth century stands in contrast to what others—most notably the Marxist British historian Eric Hobsbawm—have focused on and called the “short twentieth century,” which lasted from the start of World War I in 1914 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Thompson</em>: ‘Your “sense of politics of those years” is obviously subtler and more differentiated than mine…. You say… a part (a part, I do not omit that) of responsibility for Stalinism lies upon the Western powers. You say… “to a historian, fifty years is too short a time in which to judge a new social system.”… You say, “times when communism has shown a most human face, between 1917 and the early 1920s and again from the battle of Stalingrad to 1946”…. Your second comment is revealing, indeed. What is fifty years “to a historian”? The same day as I am writing this, I happen to have read a book by Anatol Marchenko, relating his experiences in Soviet prisons and concentration camps in the early 1960s (not 1930s)…. He got only six years of hard labour in a concentration camp. One of his stories is about three Lithuanian prisoners who tried to escape from the convoy in a forest. Two of them were quickly caught, then shot many times in the legs, then ordered to get up which they could not do, then kicked and trampled by guards, then bitten and torn up by police dogs (such an amusement, survival of capitalism) and only then stabbed to death with bayonets. All this with witty remarks by the officer, of the kind “Now, free Lithuania, crawl, you’ll get your independence straight off!” The third prisoner was shot and, reputed to be dead, was thrown under corpses in the cart; discovered later to be alive he was not killed (de-stalinization!) but left for several days in a dark cell with his festering wound and he survived after his arm was cut off…. What is fifty years to a historian? Fifty years covering the life of an obscure Russian worker Marchenko or of a still more obscure Lithuanian student who has not even written a book?

The success of the attack resulted from careful Japanese planning and a series of American intelligence failures…. The US immediately appreciated the need for a centralized, professionalized intelligence service, but had little experience in operating one. In part on the basis of advice from the British, the United States established the Office of Strategic Services in June 1942. This organization would become the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), formally inaugurated in 1947. The OSS would primarily act as an operational intelligence organization, leaving intelligence collection and analysis mostly to the services. In the wake of the war, the United States government was determined to anticipate and prevent another surprise. Much else had changed. The Army and Navy remained at levels of mobilization unimaginable in the years before the war.&nbsp; In 1947 the National Security Act broke the Air Force away from the US Army, created the Department of Defense, and founded the CIA.&nbsp; Many of the intelligence reforms would focus on the process of aggregating and integrating intelligence collection…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.19fortyfive.com/2021/12/how-pearl-harbor-changed-america-forever/">https://www.19fortyfive.com/2021/12/how-pearl-harbor-changed-america-forever/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Across a singularity-like divide:</p><blockquote><p><strong>E.

I perceive that you are indeed a native of that hellish Planet Three, upon which it was assumed for so long that no life could possibly exist…. ”All I can understand of your occupation is the name you have given it. What does a Chief Dexitroboper do?” “She—or he—or, perhaps, it … is a supervisor of the work of dexitroboping.” The thought, while perfectly clear, was completely meaningless to Samms, and the Palainian knew it. She tried again. “Dexitroboping has to do with… nourishment? No–with nutrients.” “Ah. Farming–agriculture,” Samms thought; but this time it was the Palainian who could not grasp the concept. “Hunting? Fishing?” No better. “Show me, then, please.” She tried; but demonstration, too, was useless; for to Samms the Palainian’s movements were pointless indeed. The peculiarly flowing subtly changing thing darted back and forth, rose and fell, appeared and disappeared; undergoing the while cyclic changes in shape and form and size, in aspect and texture. It was now spiny, now tentacular, now scaly, now covered with peculiarly repellent feather-like fronds, each oozing a crimson slime. But it apparently did not do anything whatever. The net result of all its activity was, apparently, zero. “There, it is done.” Pilinipsi’s thought again came clear. “You observed and understood? You did not.
