They make most of the decisions and take most of the actions. That is how we think. A prime minister like Otto von Bismarck maneuvers to retain power. The working class decides to give him some of their votes in return for national health insurance. So Germany chooses, precociously, to march down the road of social insurance and social democracy. Often this is metaphor: the ocean seeks to climb closer to the moon and so we feel the tides, and the lightning chooses to follow the least-resistance path to the ground.</p><p>I started this book with the protagonist, the actor, being humanity as a whole. Collectively and individually, we sought a better life for ourselves and security and survival for our descendants; we took actions; and things happened. The processes and factors seemed almost inevitable—the actions and decisions of particular individual mostly offset one another, and if an opportunity was not seized by one person at one date it was soon enough seized by another. We have a sense that things could have turned out very differently. But we cannot point to a single decision crux where some individual human decided to turn right instead of left and so made the difference.</p><p>Two chapters ago we shifted our focus from economics to political economy: we needed to look not just at technology, production, organization, and exchange, but also at how people governing themselves and others tried to regulate the economy to preserve or produce a good society, or a society good for them.</p><p>One chapter ago we shifted our focus to imperial politics: we needed to look not just at how peoples and their elites governed themselves, but how they governed others. Each of these shifts brought us toward processes and factors particular individuals and their actions mattered. But, still, they did not quite allow us to reach the level at which the actions of individuals that we can understand from the inside via our empathy and imagination mattered. Even as decisive and important individual as Nikola Tesla simply turned one—very important—technological clock forward by a decade. Herbert Hoover and Jennie Jerome and Li Hongzhang and company are, mostly, not decisive individuals but rather stand-ins for thousands if not more whose actions make imperialism, link Britain to the United States, and fail to put China on the road to rapid industrialization that Japan followed.</p><p>In this chapter we take a further step. We move to where choice and chance are dominant, into war, governance, and high politics. In this chapter individuals matter. This fits awkwardly into an economic history. But it is necessary. For we cannot understand what the world was like in 1918 without grappling with World War I. Things could have happened very differently. And if they had, we today would live in a very different world.</p><p>Alas, we do not. For as Angell scribbled, he missed the quite plan fact that humanity had not outgrown large scale war.</p><p>As we make this shift of perspective to the—this is not economists’ distinction between “micro” and “macro”, so let’s call it “system” and “individual”—the individual level, we see who did what, and we can use our hard-wired abilities to get inside the minds of the human actors to understand why. And we find that our stories of history become both more and less comprehensible. They become more because we understand the making of the decisions. When decisions are made at the macro-level system-level, “deciding’ is only a metaphor. Thus what is causing who and who is causing what gets blurred into near incomprehensibility. When decisions are made at the individual level, we understand from the inside what happened. Yet, somehow, our knowledge remains unsatisfactory. It slips away from us, because we can also see how key actors might have decided differently, and historical logic thus dissolves into chance and confusion.</p><div><hr></div><p>A paragraph from Ron Rosenbaum's retrospective review of William Shirer's <em>The Rise &amp; Fall of the Third Reich </em>that I greatly envy:</p><blockquote><p>Writing&nbsp;<em>The Rise and Fall</em>&nbsp;was an extraordinary act of… literary-historical generalship—to conquer a veritable continent of information… that terrain of horror in a mere 1,250 pages….

Go where you belong from now on—in the garbage-pile of history!”&nbsp;</p><p>These words are worth pondering for the light they throw on the course of Marxist policy and thought. Observe that the merging of yourself with the onrush of the current of history is to save you from the ignoble fate of being a “pitiful isolated individual”; and that the failure to so merge yourself will relegate you to the garbage-pile of history, where you can presumably be of no more use.&nbsp;</p><p>Today [in the late 1930s], though we may agree with the Bolsheviks that Martov was no man of action, his croakings over the course that they had adopted seem to us full of far-sighted intelligence. He pointed out that proclaiming a socialist regime in conditions different from those [of advanced industrialization, high technology, and material abundance] contemplated by Marx would not realize the results that Marx expected; that Marx and Engels had usually described the “dictatorship of the proletariat” as having the form, for the new dominant class, of a democratic republic, with universal suffrage [for the working class] and the popular recall of officials; that the [Bolshevik] slogan “All power to the Soviets [workers’ councils]” had never really meant what it said and that it had soon been exchanged by Lenin for “All power to the Bolshevik Party.”&nbsp;</p><p>There sometimes turn out to be valuable objects cast away in the garbage pile of history—things that have to be retrieved later on. From the point of view of the Stalinist Soviet Union, that is where [Leon] Trotsky himself is today [in the late 1930s]. He might well discard his earlier assumption that an isolated individual must needs be “pitiful” for the conviction of Dr. Stockman in Ibsen’s [play] <em>An Enemy of the People</em> that “the strongest man is he who stands most alone…&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Trotsky’s most influential biographer, Isaac Deutscher, wrestled with these issues. You can see it in the titles of the three volumes of his biography: <em>Trotsky: The Prophet Armed</em>, London: Oxford University Press, 1954 &lt;https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.507702&gt;; <em>Trotsky: The Prophet Unarmed</em>, London: Oxford University Press, 1959 &lt;https://archive.org/details/prophetunarmed00isaa&gt;; <em>Trotsky: The Prophet Outcast</em>, London: Oxford University Press, 1963 &lt;https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.462974&gt;.</p><p></p><p>Michael Ignatieff,&nbsp;<em>Isaiah Berlin: A Life,</em>&nbsp;London: Henry Holt and Company, 1998, pp. 234-5 &lt;https://archive.org/details/isaiahberlinlife0000igna_d2t2/&gt;: “Berlin’s reply—that Deutscher was ‘the only man whose presence in the same academic community I should find morally intolerable…’ Berlin hastened to add that he would have supported the claims of a C.
