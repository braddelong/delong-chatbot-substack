FIRST: International Relations Has a Mearsheimer Problem

One thing worth reading:

Jarrod Hayes & Adam B. Lerner: a€~Mearsheimera€™ s interventions reveal some larger problems for 
IR^\ First and foremost is the issue of agency and responsibility^!. If, as Mearsheimera€™ s theory 
predicts, the Russian invasion is due to its inevitable quest for regional hegemony in the
balance of power, why blame anyone?a€!. Seconda€! the Politicoes} describ[ing] weighty moral issues 
in the same gamified tone as fantasy baseballa€! portray [ing] the predictions of our theories as 
excuses for war crimesa€!. If the Russian Foreign Ministry is citing you favorably, you might want
to have a good look in the mirrora€!

f-ukraine.html>
And another one:

Stephen Kotkin: Dond€™ t Blame the West for RussiaaS™ s Invasion of Ukraine'. a€~Way before NATO 
existed in the 19th century, Russia looked like this. It had an autocrat, it had repression, it had 
militarism. It had suspicion of foreigners and the West. This is a Russia we know, and ita€™ s not
a Russia that arrived yesterday or arrived in the 1990s. Ita€™ s not a response to actions of the 
West. There are internal processes in Russia that account for where we are todaya€!. NATO expansion 
has put us in a better place to deal with this historical pattern in Russia that wea€™re seeing

againa€!. Russia is a great power, but not the great powera€!. In trying toa€! manage the 
differential between Russia and the West, they resort to coercion, a very heavy state-centric 
approacha€!. That works for a time, ostensiblya€!. And then, of course, it hits a walla€!. The 
worst part of this
dynamic in Russian history is the conflation of the Russian state with some personal rulera€!. They 
get a dictatorship, which usually becomes a despotism. So Putin is what he isa€! ruling in 
Russiaa€!. Russia cannot successfully occupy Ukrainea€!. They dona€™ t even have a quisling yeta€!

Russia today has a population of 150 million people. Of those some 120 million are "Russians" and 
30 million are classified as ethnic minorities. Russiaa€™ s GDP is in the range of Japan, Germany, 
Indonesia, Brazil, Britain, and Francea€”20% above France, 30% below Japan. In a world in which 
nato exists to make real
into implement, for Europe at least, the dreams of ending war and military coercion set out at the 
San Francisco founding of the United Nations, Russiaa€™ s ability to bully other countries via its 
military is very small. It can wreck things, but a€oemaking a desert and calling it a€~peacea€™ a€D 
is on longer a rational
strategy.

Military conquest seems unlikely to be durable in this day and age, unless accompanied by 
nigh-complete ethnic cleansing and demographic replacement. But was it ever? In 1721 King Frederick 
I Vasa of Sweden surrendered Swedish Ingria, Estonia, Livonia, KexholmslAPn, and Karelia to Tsar 
Peter the Great. But Peter
accepted that his conquest was limited: the Germanic-speaking Baltic nobility retained a€oetheir 
financial system, their existing customs border, their self-government, their Lutheran religion, 
and the German languagea€D. Starting in 1860 the Tsarist Empire attempted to erode these privileges 
and a€ceRussifya€D. But as
of today of all these conquests of the Great Northern War of the early 1700s, only Petera€™ s 
conquest of Swedish Ingriaa€’’where St. Petersburg now standsa€”has stuck.

Indeed, in this day and age, military adventures appear more likely to make durable enemies rather 
than win subjects and influence. It will be very difficult to get Ukrainians to think of themselves 
as in any sense Muscovites after this.

Thus if Russia wants to be a great power rather than a contained menace, it must rely on its soft 
power. Hence a Russia that wants to have influence over the course of the world in the future and 
lead the people of Ross and the other Slavic peoples and their neighbors into the future will have 
to rely on its soft power: its role
as a provider of natural resources, and both the wealth and the possibly weaponized interdependence 
that come with resources; plus its cultural power. A Russia that wants to be an influential Russia 
should be building not tanks but touring companies of the Bolshoi Ballet, and binding the world 
economy to its resource base.

The problem isa€”the problems area€”(a) that Putin is not rational, (b) that Russiaa€™ s autocratic 
domestic politics have long leaked into its foreign-policy adventurism and right now is doing it 
again in a way that seems strongly counterproductive, and (c) the very unrealistic a€ceRealista€D 
assumption that only the
United States has agency, and as the only actor with agency bears complete responsibility for 
whatever bad things happen, would cloud our thought on all this, if we let it.

Perhaps the most strange and bizarre thing about Mearsheimer is that the theory he draws on implies 
that states seeking regional hegemony are never satisfied with any borders, and continue 
adventuring in a pointless quest for more security until they run up against a force to contain 
them. a€oeRealisma€D in its tragic
model recognizes that spheres-of-influence borders are always and inherently potentially bloody. 
Thus the only question for a consistent Mearsheimer is whether Muscovy will bloody Donbas, Moldava, 
the Hungarian Plain, the Fulda Gap, or the Rhine. But the drive to blame America first overrides 
consistency.

Paragraphs:

This is a rather strange piece. Matthew Yglesias says that Jesse Jackson was right on the merits 
back in 1988. Matthew Yglesias says that Jesse Jackson is right on the merits today. But he says 
the DLC was right on the strategy in 1988a€”cater to the electorate as it exists, and create a 
big-tent party rather than one "whose
brand is dominated by leftist intellectualsa€D. But creating a big-tent party is what elected 
Democratic office-holders (and those who hope to get elected in competitive seats) do. And it is 
what Democratic-oriented policy intellectuals in the policy entrepreneurs do. a€oeLeftist 
intellectualsa€D shitpost on Twitter and rant in
podcasts and in little magazines. And Republicans say: a€oeyou must elect us or these people will 
make your life hell.a€D And reporters for the Washington Post and the New York Times and CNN 
pretend to take seriously Republican claims that Democratic office-holders are beholden to Twitter 
shitposters. Matt urges
Democratic office-holders to talk about Democratic policy proposals that are popular. But they 
already do that. So shouldna€™ t Matt be urging shitposters to talk about Democratic policy 
proposals that are popular? And it is not clear how that is advanced by saying a€oethe DLC was 
right even though it was wronga€C. I
will   try to resolve this puzzlement:

Matthew Yglesias: What the DLC Got Wrong'. a€~The DLC hated Jesse Jackson, but I think his speech 
at the 1988 Democratic National Convention is great: a€oelt does not make sense to be escorting all 
our tankers up and down the Persian Gulf paying $2.50 for every $1 worth of oil we bring out,
while oil wells are capped in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. I just want to make sense. Leadership 
must meet the moral challenge of its day. Whata€™ s the moral challenge of our day? We have public 
accommodations. We have the right to vote. We have open housing. Whata€™ s the fundamental
challenge of our day? It is to end economic violence. Plant closings without noticea€’’economic 
violence. Even the greedy do not profit long from greeda€’’economic violence. Most poor people are 
not lazy. They are not black. They are not brown. They are mostly White and female and young. But

bus. They work every day. They raise other peoplea€™ s children. They work everyday. They clean the 
streets. They work everyday. They drive dangerous cabs. They change the beds you slept in in
these hotels last night and cana€™ t get a union contract. They work everyday. No, no, theya€™ re 
not lazy. Someone must defend them because ita€™ s right and they cannot speak for themselves. They 
work in hospitals. I know they do. They wipe the bodies of those who are sick with fever and
pain. They empty their bedpans. They clean out their commodes. No job is beneath them, and yet when 
they get sick they cannot lie in the bed they made up every day. America, that is not right! We are 
a better Nation than that!a€D This is the idea that I have referred to in the past as the a€oewisdom
of the ancients,a€D reflecting how Martin Luther King, Bayard Rustin, and other Civil Rights 
Movement leaders thought about the questions facing America after the successes of the early 1960s. 
It involves exhorting people to find unity in common economic uplift rather than emphasizing elite­
level diversity or the need to center the racial angle in every controversy. Was this Jackson 
message too left-wing for 1988? Maybe. Was America just too racist to vote for a Black person no 
matter what he said? Very plausibly. Public opinion was way more conservative in the 1990s, and to 
an extent,
we maybe couldna€™ t have done much better than Bill Clinton. But we know Americans in Iowa and 
Ohio and Florida were ready to vote twice for Barack Obama based on a message of unity. And while I 
think his administration had serious failings, I think these were mostly failures of technical

policy analysis (especially about the deficit/stimulus balance) rather than basic political 
judgment. And I think what Democrats need today is more TAP in 2002 than TNR in 2002, more William 
Julius Wilson than Will Marshall. But the big DLC meta-analytic points about the need to cater to 
the
existing electorate and create a big tent party rather than one whose brand is dominated by leftist 
intellectuals are completely correcta€!

Avery nice technical exercise in modern economics. The problem with this of course is the a€oerisk 
premiaa€D in asset markets not really risk premia, in the sense of being compensation for the extra 
uncertainty in future consumption and hence lowered expected utility delivered by the combination 
of uncertainty and the
declining marginal utility of wealth. Thus how population aging and hence shorter horizons would 
alter risk premia if people were in fact insanely risk-averse because of an insanely rapidly 
declining marginal utility of wealtha€! It is a gesture toward a a€oecrowded tradea€D explanation 
of the phenomena, but only a
gesture:

Joseph Kopecky & Alan M. Taylor: The Savings Glut of the Old: Population Aging, the Risk Premium, 
and the Murder-Suicide of the Rentier. a€~Population aging has been linked to a global savings glut 
and a decline in safe real interest ratesa€!. We go further to account for divergent returns on
different assets as well as the underlying surge in the wealth-income ratio and its asset 
composition^!. Demographic shifts are correlated with asset returns and risk premiaa€!. A 
heterogeneous agent life-cycle model with two assets (a safe bond and equity) and with aggregate 
risk [and] aging
demographicsa€! the rising wealth-income ratio, the falling risk free rate, and an increasing risk 
premiuma€!. Aging makes retirement saving a a€oecrowded tradea€O but more so for bonds. Projecting 
our model to 2050, aging pushes the safe rate below zero, but the risk premium remains elevated,
as post-boomer demographics push asset returns to unprecedented and persistently low levelsa€!

Increasing the scope of human connection and contact through figuring out how to use remote 
technologies effectively should be very very good. I know that I at least am looking forward to a 
quantum jump in the effectiveness of my office hours even after the plague recedes. Phone calls 
were never a good substitute for
office hours. Video calls will bea€”and it will be a lot easier to get people to show up for video 
calls then to get them to Trump up to the sixth floor of Evans, or even over to the coffee shop. 
The potential downside is, as always, the possible loss of external benefits from close proximity 
in meatspace. And we should think
very hard about how to avoid that a loss of positive externalities. And if we do so I think then we 
can be very hopeful:

Noah Smith: Think Bigger About Remote Work'. a€~Let me throw out a few things that I think are 
being totally underestimated by pessimists who would rather focus on direct effects and adjustment 
costsa€!. You can now create brand new places, far from existing labor markets, and lure in skilled
remote workers with nice amenitiesa€!. My hope is that the next decade will lead property 
developers, planners, and investors to create brand new remote-worker villages and new places aimed 
at remote workers in locations previously untenable, all with amenities and forms that are as new 
and
exciting  as the changes past transportation innovations have ushered ina€!. Remote-work patents 
have surged and new innovations in how we work together remotely are clearly underway. What this 
heralds remains to be seen, maybe virtual or augmented reality, maybe it just becomes easier to
cross-talk                                                                                          
                                            on Zoom. Either way, however well remote work is going 
now, it is only going to get bettera€!. New business formation has surged post-pandemica€!. Like 
almost all technologies, remote work will surely include significant adjustment costs and winners 
and losersa€!. What we should not
do is succumb to a myopic pessimism that focuses on the direct costs and not on the wider benefits 
and potentials!. The question whether society gets the full benefits of remote work in significant 
part comes down to whether policymakers stand in the way of the possibilities that are opening 
upa€!

The problem with Web3 is threefold: First, the good part of ita€”the trusted, decentralized, 
community-owned database part to protect against the builders of walled gardensa€”is inevitably a 
public good, and a public good that can only exist if the database is properly managed and pruned 
to protect its ecology from bad
actors. Second, the big money in it comes from out-and-out grifts, and from building the 
infrastructure to support large-scale crime. And, third, the medium money in it comes from 
degrading the quality of the trusted, decentralized, community-owned database part. The government 
could do Web3 in an effective way. Apple
could do it for the Apple ecosystem. Google could do it were Google to be not evil. But Silicon 
Valley as a decentralized institution cannot:

Nilay Patel: Chris Dixon Thinks Web3 Is the Future of the Interneta€’Ts It?: a€~Webla€! 1990 to 
2005a€!. The platform that you built on was the web or on emaila€! open protocols designed by the 
government and academiaa€! became the governing protocols of the early interneta€! a very
positive thinga€!. Web2a€! 2005 to 2020a€! social networking^!. A big negative thing with Web2: We 
basically handed over the power of the effective de facto control of the internet to five or so 
companies. Open protocols still exist, you can still go to websites, but effectively most of the 
power
and most of the money on the web goes to Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, and maybe Twitter and a 
handful of other[s]a€!. If Web3 works righta€! it is the best of both worlds of Webl and Web2a€! 
advanced functionalitya€! from Web2a€! the predictability, reliability, and neutrality of Webl
protocolsa€! creative people, businesses, and startupsa€! reach audiences directly, and to truly 
have a relationship with those audiences that is not mediated by algorithms and advertising^! which 
is where I think we are todaya€!. A lot of why Twitter won is that, opposed to RSS, they had a 
global
namespace. The problem with RSS and with Mastodon is the internet right now has no publicly owned, 
common database; there is no place to store that follow graph. That is why companies stepped in and 
said, a€oeWea€™ 11 store it for you.a€D Then once they stored it, they ended up having
monopolistic network effects. One way to look at a blockchain is as a community-owned databasea€!

SUBJECT: My Project Syndicate Columns

By now there are a lot of them, <https://www.project-svndicate.org/columnist/j-bradford-delong>. 
234 of them. 165,000 words. Closer to 300,000 if I let the arguments in them uncoil out of their 
op-ed-length Procrustean beds into their proper length.
Surely a number of these are wise, and worth resurfacing? Surely there is a book, or two, or three, 
in there somewhere that I should publish?

Anybody who has suggestions for what I should do with these should please email mea€”or comment. 
And this is one more reason why I should try to get a few more paying subscribers to this thing, 
for figuring out which ones should be resurfaceda€’’and howa€”would be a good project for the 
still-mythical RA for this:
