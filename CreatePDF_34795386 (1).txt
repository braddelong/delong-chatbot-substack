J. Bradford DeLong and Barry J. Eichengreen: New Preface to Charles Kindleberger, The World in 
Depression 1929-1939'. The parallels between Europe in the 1930s and Europe today are stark, 
striking, and increasingly frightening. We see unemployment, youth unemployment especially, soaring 
to unprecedented heights. Financial instability and distress are widespread. There is growing 
political support for extremist parties of the far left and right.

Both the existence of these parallels and their tragic nature would not have escaped Charles 
Kindleberger, whose World in Depression, 1929-1939 was published exactly 40 years ago, in 1973.[1] 
Where Kindlebergera€™ s canvas was the world, his focus was Europe. While much of the earlier 
literature, often authored by Americans, focused on the Great Depression in the US, Kindleberger 
emphasised that the Depression had a prominent international and, in
particular, European dimension. It was in Europe where many of the Depressiona€™ s worst effects, 
political as well as economic, played out. And it was in Europe where the absence of a public 
policy authority at the level of the continent and the inability of any individual national 
government or central bank to exercise adequate leadership had the most calamitous economic and 
financial effects.[2]

These were ideas that Kindleberger impressed upon generations of students as well on his reading 
public. Indeed, anyone fortunate enough to live in New England in the early 1980s and possessed of 
even a limited interest in international financial and monetary history felt compelled to walk, 
drive or take the T (as metropolitan Bostona€™ s subway is known to locals) down to MIT's Sloan 
Building in order to listen to Kindlebergera€™ s lectures on the subject
(including both the authors of this preface). We understood about half of what he said and 
recognised about a quarter of the historical references and allusions. The experience was 
intimidating: Paul Krugman, who was a member of this same group and went on to be awarded the Nobel 
Prize for his work in international economics, has written how Kindleberger's course nearly scared 
him away from international macroeconomics. Kindleberger's lectures were
surely a€oefull of wisdom", Krugman notes. But then, a€oewho feels wise in their twenties?" 
(Krugman 2002).

There was indeed much wisdom in Kindlebergera€™ s lectures, about how markets work, about how they 
are managed, and especially about how they can go wrong. It is no accident that when Martin Wolf, 
dean of the British financial journalists, challenged then former-US Treasury Secretary Lawrence 
Summers in 2011 to deny that economists had proven themselves useless in the 2008-9 financial 
crisis, Summers's response was that, to the contrary, there was
a useful economics. But what was useful for understanding financial crises was to be found not in 
the academic mainstream of mathematical models festooned with Greek symbols and complex abstract 
relationships but in the work of the pioneering 19th century financial journalist Walter Bagehot, 
the 20th-century bubble theorist Hyman Minsky, and "perhaps more still in Kindleberger" (Wolf and 
Summers 2011).

Summers was right. We speak from personal experience: for a generation the two of us have been 
living a€“ very well, thank you a€“ off the rich dividends thrown off by the intellectual capital 
that we acquired from Charles Kindleberger, earning our pay cheques by teaching our students some 
small fraction of what Charlie taught us. Three lessons stand out, the first having to do with 
panic in financial markets, the second with the power of contagion, the third
with the importance of hegemony.

First, panic. Kindleberger argued that panic, defined as sudden overwhelming fear giving rise to 
extreme behaviour on the part of the affected, is intrinsic in the operation of financial markets. 
In The World in Depression he gave the best ever a€oeexplain-and-illustrate-with-examplesa€n answer 
to the question of how and why panic occurs and financial markets fall apart. Kindleberger was an 
early apostate from the efficient-markets school of thought that
markets not just get it right but also that they are intrinsically stable. His rival in attempting 
to explain the Great Depression, Milton Friedman, had famously argued that speculation in financial 
markets cana€™ t be destabilising because if destabilising speculators drive asset values away from 
justified, or equilibrium, levels, such speculators will lose money and eventually be driven out of 
the market.[3]

Kindleberger pushed back by observing that markets can continue to get it wrong for a very, very 
long time. He girded his position by elaborating and applying the work of Minsky, who had argued 
that markets pass through cycles characterised first by self-reinforcing boom, next by crash, then 
by panic, and finally by revulsion and depression. Kindleberger documented the ability of what is 
now sometimes referred to as the Minsky-Kindleberger framework to
explain the behaviour of markets in the late 1920s and early 1930s a€“ behaviour about which 
economists otherwise might have arguably had little of relevance or value to say. The Minsky 
paradigm emphasising the possibility of self-reinforcing booms and busts is the organising 
framework of The World in Depression. It then comes to the fore in all its explicit glory in 
Kindlebergera€™ s subsequent book and summary statement of the approach, Mania, Panics
and Crashes. [4]

Kindlebergera€™ s second key lesson, closely related, is the power of contagion. At the centre of 
The World in Depression is the 1931 financial crisis, arguably the event that turned an already 
serious recession into the most severe downturn and economic catastrophe of the 20th century. The 
1931 crisis began, as Kindleberger observes, in a relatively minor European financial centre, 
Vienna, but when left untreated leapfrogged first to Berlin and then, with even
graver consequences, to London and New York. This is the 20th centurya€™ s most dramatic reminder 
of quickly how financial crises can metastasise almost instantaneously. In 1931 they spread through 
a number of different channels. German banks held deposits in Vienna. Merchant banks in London had 
extended credits to German banks and firms to help finance the countrya€™ s foreign trade. In 
addition to financial links, there were psychological links: as
soon as a big bank went down in Vienna, investors, having no way to know for sure, began to fear 
that similar problems might be lurking in the banking systems of other European countries and the 
US.


Kindleberger pushed back by observing that markets can continue to get it wrong for a very, very

Kindlebergera€™ s second key lesson, closely related, is the power of contagion. At the centre of 
The World in Depression is the 1931 financial crisis, arguably the event that turned an already 
serious recession into the most severe downturn and economic catastrophe of the 20th century. The 
1931 crisis began, as Kindleberger observes, in a relatively minor European financial centre, 
Vienna, but when left untreated leapfrogged first to Berlin and then, with even
graver consequences, to London and New York. This is the 20th centurya€™ s most dramatic reminder 
of quickly how financial crises can metastasise almost instantaneously. In 1931 they spread through 
a number of different channels. German banks held deposits in Vienna. Merchant banks in London had 
extended credits to German banks and firms to help finance the countrya€™ s foreign trade. In 
addition to financial links, there were psychological links: as
soon as a big bank went down in Vienna, investors, having no way to know for sure, began to fear 
that similar problems might be lurking in the banking systems of other European countries and the 
US.

In the same way that problems in a small country, Greece, could threaten the entire European System 
in 2012, problems in a small country, Austria, could constitute a lethal threat to the entire 
global financial system in 1931 in the absence of effective action to prevent them from spreading.

This brings us to Kindlebergera€™ s third lesson, which has to do with the importance of hegemony, 
defined as a preponderance of influence and power over others, in this case over other nation 
states. Kindleberger argued that at the root of Europea€™ s and the worlda€™ s problems in the 
1920s and 1930s was the absence of a benevolent hegemon: a dominant economic power able and willing 
to take the interests of smaller powers and the operation of the
larger international system into account by stabilising the flow of spending through the global or 
at least the North Atlantic economy, and doing so by acting as a lender and consumer of last 
resort. Great Britain, now but a middle power in relative economic decline, no longer possessed the 
resources commensurate with the job. The rising power, the US, did not yet realise that the 
maintenance of economic stability required it to assume this role. In contrast to the
period before 1914, when Britain acted as hegemon, or after 1945, when the US did so, there was no 
one to stabilise the unstable economy. Europe, the world economya€™ s chokepoint, was rendered 
rudderless, unstable, and crisis- and depression-prone.

That is Kindlebergera€™ s World in Depression in a nutshell. As he put it in 1973:

The 1929 depression was so wide, so deep and so long because the international economic system was 
rendered unstable by British inability and United States unwillingness to assume responsibility for 
stabilising it in three particulars: (a) maintaining a relatively open market for distress goods; 
(b) providing counter-cyclical long-term lending; and (c) discounting in crisisa€I. The world 
economic system was unstable unless some country
stabilised it, as Britain had done in the nineteenth century and up to 1913. In 1929, the British 
couldn't and the United States wouldn't. When every country turned to protect its national private 
interest, the world public interest went down the drain, and with it the private interests of 
alla€!

Subsequently these insights stimulated a considerable body of scholarship in economics, 
particularly models of international economic policy coordination with and without a dominant 
economic power, and in political science, where Kindlebergera€™ s a€oetheory of hegemonic 
stabilitya€D is perhaps the leading approach used by political scientists to understand how order 
can be maintained in an otherwise anarchic international system.[5]

It might be hoped that something would have been learned from this considerable body of 
scholarship. Yet today, to our surprise, alarm and dismay, we find ourselves watching a rerun of 
Europe in 1931. Once more, panic and financial distress are widespread. And, once more, Europe 
lacks a hegemon a€“ a dominant economic power capable of taking the interests of smaller powers and 
the operation of the larger international system into account by stabilising
flows of finance and spending through the European economy.

The ECB does not believe it has the authority: its mandate, the argument goes, requires it to 
mechanically pursue an inflation target a€“ which it defines in practice as an inflation ceiling. 
It is not empowered, it argues, to act as a lender of the last resort to distressed financial 
markets, the indispensability of a lender of last resort in times of crisis being another powerful 
message of The World in Depression. The EU, a diverse collection of more than two dozen
states, has found it difficult to reach a consensus on how to react. And even on those rare 
occasions where it does achieve something approaching a consensus, the wheels turn slowly, too 
slowly compared to the crisis, which turns very fast.

The German federal government, the political incarnation of the single most consequential economic 
power in Europe, is one potential hegemon. It has room for countercyclical fiscal policy. It could 
encourage the European Central Bank to make more active use of monetary policy. It could fund a 
Marshall Plan for Greece and signal a willingness to assume joint responsibility, along with its EU 
partners, for some fraction of their collective debt. But Germany
still thinks of itself as the steward is a small open economy. It repeats at every turn that it is 
beyond its capacity to stabilise the European system: a€oeGerman taxpayers can only bear so much 
after alla€D. Unilaterally taking action to stabilise the European economy is not, in any case, its 
responsibility, as the matter is perceived. The EU is not a union where big countries lead and 
smaller countries follow docilely but, at least ostensibly, a collection of equals.
Germanya€™ s own difficult history in any case makes it difficult for the country to assert its 
influence and authority and equally difficult for its EU partners, even those who most desperately 
require it, to accept such an assertion.[6] Europe, everyone agrees, needs to strengthen its 
collective will and ability to take collective action. But in the absence of a hegemon at the 
European level, this is easier said than done.

The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, is not sufficiently well capitalised to do the job even 
were its non-European members to permit it to do so, which remains doubtful. Viewed from Asia or, 
for that matter, from Capitol Hill, Europea€™ s problems are properly solved in Europe. More 
concretely, the view is that the money needed to resolve Europea€™ s economic and financial crisis 
should come from Europe. The US government and Federal
Reserve System, for their part, have no choice but to view Europea€™ s problems from the sidelines. 
A cash-strapped US government lacks the resources to intervene big-time in Europea€™ s affairs in 
1948; there will be no 21st century analogue of the Marshall Plan, when the US through the Economic 
Recovery Programme, of which the young Charles Kindleberger was a major architect, extended a 
generous package of foreign aid to help stabilise an unstable
continent. Today, in contrast, the Congress is not about to permit Greece, Ireland, Portugal, 
Italy, and Spain to incorporate in Delaware as bank holding companies and join the Federal Reserve 
System.[7]

In a sense, Kindleberger predicted all this in 1973. He saw the power and willingness of the US to 
bear the responsibility and burden of sacrifice required of benevolent hegemony as likely to falter 
in subsequent generations. He saw three positive and three negative branches on the then-future's 
probability tree. The positive outcomes were: "[i] revived United States leadershipa€! [ii] an 
assertion of leadership and assumption of responsibility... by Europea€!a€D
[sitting here, in 2013, one might be tempted to add emerging markets like China as potentially 
stepping into the leadership breach, although in practice the Chinese authorities have been 
reluctant to go there, and] [iii] cession of economic sovereignty to international 
institutionsa€!.a€D Here, in a sense, Kindleberger had both global and regional a€“ meaning 
European a€“ institutions in mind. a€oeThe lasta€D, meaning a global solution, a€oeis the most
attractivea€D, he concluded,a€D but perhaps, because difficult, the least likelya€!" The negative 
outcomes were: "(a) the United States and the [EU] vying for leaderships! (b) one unable to lead 
and the other unwilling, as in 1929 to 1933a€! (c) each retaining a vetoa€! without seeking to 
secure positive programmesa€!"

As we write, the North Atlantic world appears to have fallen foul to his bad outcome (c), with 
extraordinary political dysfunction in the US preventing its government from acting as a benevolent 
hegemon, and the ruling mandarins of Europe, in Germany in particular, unwilling to step up and 
convince their voters that they must assume the task.
It was fear of this future that led Kindleberger to end The World in Depression with the 
observation: a€oeln these circumstances, the third positive alternative of international 
institutions with real authority and sovereignty is pressing.a€D

Indeed it is, more so now than ever.

Notes

[1] Kindleberger passed away in 2003. A second modestly revised and expanded edition of The World 
in Depression was published, also by the University of California Press, in 1986. The second 
edition differed mainly by responding to the authora€™ s critics and commenting to some subsequent 
literature. We have chosen to reproduce the a€~unvarnisheda€™ 1973 Kindleberger, where the key 
points are made in unadorned fashion.

[2] The book was commissioned originally for a series on the economic history of Europe, with each 
author writing on a different decade. This points to the question of why the title was not, 
instead, a€oeEurope in Depress ion.a€D The answer, presumably, is that the author a€“ and his 
publisher wished to acknowledge that the Depression was not exclusively a European phenomenon and 
that the linkages between Europe and the US were also critically
important.

[3] Friedmana€™ s great work on the Depression, coauthored with Anna Jacobson Schwartz (1963), was 
in Kindlebergera€™ s view too monocausal, focusing on the role of monetary policy, and too U.S. 
centric. See also Friedman (1953)

[4] Kindleberger (1978). Kindleberger amply acknowledged his intellectual debt to Minsky. But we 
are not alone if we suggest that Kindlebergera€™ s admirably clear presentation of the framework, 
and the success with which he documented its power by applying it to historical experience, 
rendered it more impactful in the academy and generally.

[5] A sampling of work in economics on international policy coordination inspired by Kindleberger 
includes Eichengreen (1987) and Hughes Hallet, Mooslechner and Scheurz (2001). Three important 
statements of the relevant work in international relations are Keohane (1984), Gilpin (1987) and 
Lake (1993).

[6] The European Union was created, in a sense, precisely in order to prevent the reassertion of 
German hegemony.

[7] The point being that the US, in contrast, does possess a central bank willing, under certain 
circumstances, to acknowledge its responsibility for acting as a lender of last resort. Nothing in 
fact prevents the Federal Reserve, under current institutional arrangements from, say, purchasing 
the bonds of distressed Southern European sovereigns. But this would be viewed as peculiar and 
inappropriate in many quarters. The Fed has a full plate of other problems. And
intervening in European bond markets, the argument would go, is properly the responsibility of the 
leading European monetary authority.
