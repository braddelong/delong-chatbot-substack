What would the single best reference to drop be?</p><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/delong/status/1419678330039635972">https://twitter.com/delong/status/1419678330039635972</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p><strong>NIcholas Gruen</strong>:&nbsp;<em> tricky question</em>&nbsp;because Michael Polanyi was a chemist, then an economist and then a philosopher. His only important publications in economics proper are are his first, which was the first to show how little the Soviet economic expansion was funding improved living standards, and&nbsp;<em>Full Employment and Free Trade</em>, which outlines a neoliberal (i.e. minimally interventionist) Keynesianism with which some of the Mont Pèlerin Society were enamoured of—like Gottfried Haberler who wrote a preface to its second edition. The issues you’re raising are probably best expressed in Polanyi’s 1941 piece “The Growth of Thought in Society”,&nbsp;<em>Economica</em>, 8:32 (Nov. 1941) &lt;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2550108">https://www.jstor.org/stable/2550108</a>&gt;. </p><p>I think his attempt to distinguish public from private liberty was a fine idea first articulated in this piece—though it never caught on. It’s another way to cut different aspects of liberty as Berlin’s ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ is. The odd thing however—it’s certainly puzzled me, is that MP doesn’t really spend much time on the professions. His categories for the occupations that both nurture and require ‘public liberty’ are those pursuing transcendent values: Science: Truth; The law: Justice; Art: Beauty; Religion: God. I came upon Polanyi after I’d come to the kind of view you sketch out there—that led me to write this essay—citing Alasdair MacIntyre and the importance of the values of professions: &lt;<a href="https://griffithreview.com/articles/trust-competition-delusion-gruen/">https://griffithreview.com/articles/trust-competition-delusion-gruen/</a>&gt;. </p><p>But on this Michael Polanyi is largely silent. And then there’s his marvellous rethinking of the philosophy of science around the centrality of tacit knowledge. Once he took up on that stuff he mostly neglected the concerns that you and are seem to be interested in!…&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/NGruen1/status/1419900091016650752">https://twitter.com/NGruen1/status/1419900091016650752</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-27-tu?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-27-tu?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Billy Ocean</strong>:&nbsp;<em>When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going</em>: &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n3sUWR4FV4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n3sUWR4FV4</a>&gt;</p><div id="youtube2--n3sUWR4FV4" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;-n3sUWR4FV4&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-n3sUWR4FV4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Guido Franzinetti</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Ödön Pór: From Socialism to Fascism, from Hungary to Italy</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="http://italogramma.elte.hu/wp-content/files/Guido_Franzinetti_Odon_Por.pdf">http://italogramma.elte.hu/wp-content/files/Guido_Franzinetti_Odon_Por.pdf</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Kari Polanyi-Levitt</strong>&nbsp;(2014):&nbsp;<em>Rosa Luxemburg Foundation Lecture</em>&lt;<a href="https://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/Veranstaltungen/2014/script_lecture_polanyi-levitt_140508.pdf">https://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/Veranstaltungen/2014/script_lecture_polanyi-levitt_140508.pdf</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Wikipedia</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Ilona Duczyńska</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilona_Duczy%C5%84ska#cite_note-1">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilona_Duczy%C5%84ska#cite_note-1</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><em>Karl Polanyi Institute of Political Economy</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://www.concordia.ca/research/polanyi.html">https://www.concordia.ca/research/polanyi.html</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Karl Polanyi</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Digital Archive</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://www.concordia.ca/research/polanyi/archive.html">https://www.concordia.ca/research/polanyi/archive.html</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Wikipedia</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Zimmerwald Conference</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmerwald_Conference">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmerwald_Conference</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Linda McQuaig</strong>&nbsp;(2001):&nbsp;<em>All You Can Eat: Greed, Lust, &amp; the New Capitalism</em>&nbsp;(New York: Penguin Books) &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/allyoucaneatgree00mcqu/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/allyoucaneatgree00mcqu/mode/2up</a>&gt; pp. 124–160.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wikipedia</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Peter Drucker</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Ödön Pór</strong>&nbsp;(1923):&nbsp;<em>Fascism</em>&nbsp;(London: Labour Publishing) &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.95399">https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.95399</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Michael Polanyi</strong>&nbsp;(1941):&nbsp;<em>The Growth of Thought in Society</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2550108">https://www.jstor.org/stable/2550108</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Daniel Immerwahr</strong> (2000): <em>Polanyi in the United States: Peter Drucker, Karl Polanyi, &amp; the Midcentury Critique of Economic Society</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20621902">https://www.jstor.org/stable/20621902</a>&gt;</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>Paragraphs:</h2><p><strong>Peter F.

But it is also clear that social responsibility cannot be evaded. It is not only that the public demands it. It is not only that society needs it.

As an unintended by-product, Eva Striker's imprisonment served as the inspiration for her childhood friend, Arthur Koestlers novel,&nbsp;<em>Darkness at Noon</em>. The series of subsequent dramatic events included Laura Polanyi’s own arrest by the Gestapo in Vienna in the aftermath of the Anschluss, and ended with her eventual success in helping her three children, her seventy-year-old husband, numerous nephews, nieces and friends to reach America.

The civil war there between Chang Tzo-lin and Chiang Kai-shek and all the other warlords,” and he chanted all those nonsense syllables again, “is the most important event of the next five years. And then we’ll have a piece on the fall of agricultural prices on the world markets—it foreshadows a serious economic depression in a few years’ time. The third piece will deal with Stalin in Russia; Leninism is dead and with it the Communist Revolution. There is a new Oriental despotism and the reintroduction of serfdom. And finally we’ll have a piece about an English economist, Keynes is his name; the man, you know, who wrote about the Economic Consequences of the Peace in 1919–20.

Eva Striker… daughter of Michael’s older sister Laura (Mausi), furnished Koestler with the account which inspired him to write&nbsp;<em>Darkness at Noon</em>. Eva followed her fiancée, the physicist Alex Weissberg, to Kharkov, Ukraine, where they were married in 1932. Their home served Koestler as his base of operations when he traveled to the Soviet Union in 1932–33 as a recently minted communist to write a book on the progress being made in the Soviet world…. The trip Koestler took into Soviet central Asia was particularly disturbing to him…. The recent convert was taken aback; his faith in Communism began to ebb. The&nbsp;<em>coup de grace</em>&nbsp;of Koestler’s identification with Communism occurred when he next saw Eva in 1938 after she was freed from the USSR. She told him the story of how, during the Soviet purges, she was charged with spying and sabotage and then had been arrested and imprisoned for sixteen months. With the help of Weissberg (from whom she had been separated in 1934) and the Austrian consul, she was released, but then Weissberg was arrested. In turn, Koestler and Polanyi were among a loose network of those who worked to free Weissberg, a task that eventually was successful….
