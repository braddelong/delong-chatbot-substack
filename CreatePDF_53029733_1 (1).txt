• Matthew Yglesias: Ita€™ s Time to Raise Taxes on the Rich


Slow Boring

It's time to raise taxes on the rich

The number one issue in the country is inflation, so Democrats ought to try to enact policies that 
reduce inflation. On a political level, it would help them a little bit to be seen as trying to 
reduce inflation (rather than seen as primarily arguing about library books), and it would help 
them even more if inflation actually went down. But ita€™ s also the case that, substantively, 
inflation is a big problem in peoplea€™ s lives and one ought to try to do something about
ita€!

Paragraphs:

Habits of thought and analysis that made great sense in the 1980s and 1990s when rock financial 
capital all by itself was very expensive no longer make any sense at all in our world of secular 
stagnation. And so the dominance of McKinsey styles of thinking may be a huge drag on Americaa€™ s 
economy:

Clayton M. Christensen (2012): The New Church of Finance: Deeply Held Belief Systems & Complex 
Codes Must Be Changed - Deseret News: a€~I talked to Morris Chang, chairman of TSMC in Taiwan, he 
asked why Americans are so eager to get assets off their balance sheets. He was quite happy to put 
assets onto his balance sheet, even though it costs about $10 billion to build a new factorya€l. 
Chang noted that banks dona€™t
accept deposits denominated in ratios. In doing so he reminded me that there is a simpler way to 
account for finances: in whole dollars. After all, that is what banks accept ?a€” dollars. 
Consequently, Chang suggested what is probably a better measure of profitability: tons of money. 
His dictum is that more tons of money is better than less tons of money. The focus on carefully 
calculated ratios might make sense when capital is scarce
because every dollar needs to be used optimally. But today capital is not scarce. Corporate balance 
sheets are flush with cash and sovereign funds in places like Abu Dhabi have money in the trillions 
of dollars. American capitalists, enthralled by the doctrines of finance, have put their income 
statements in service of the balance sheet. But under that model, cash wona€™ t be invested in new 
growth businesses because of the way the
a€oepriesthooda€n of finance defines profitability. In a more dynamic economy, the balance sheet 
would be in service to the income statement. Ita€™ s the bottom line of the income statement that a 
company can actually deposita€l. The financial doctrines so zealously followed by American 
companies might help optimize capital when it is scarce. But capital is abundanta€l. Until deeply 
held belief systems and complex codes are
changed,                                                                                            
                                                                                                    
         I fear we will continue to experience over-investment in efficiency and meager attention 
to empowering innovation, growth and jobsa€!

I confess that I had thought that Putin had known that he had turned Ukraine into an enemy of his, 
and of rushes to the extent that Russia backed him, back in 2014, with the conquest of the Crimea 
in the invasion of Luhansk and Donetsk. Yet he appears to have believed that the left-bank of the 
Dnipr and the Black-Sea coast all the way to Roumania still saw itself asa€! Russian? Could this 
possibly be true:

Aaron Erlich: Roots of the Resistance: Understanding National Identity in Ukraine: a€~Russia 
expected to quickly win the war and consolidate its military victory by coopting local elected 
officials and citizens, who were expected to rejoice in or at least countenance Russian 
occupational. Why pro-Kremlin forces believed they could count on broad popular support in Ukraine 
has sparked speculation and debatea€l. Russiaa€™ s FSB
security agency, which itself commissioned surveys in Ukraine, cherry-picked survey results that 
fit its narrativea€l. Ukrainian citizensa€™ strong rejection of the Russian occupation spotlights 
how Russiaa€™ s war in Ukraine is one of attempted imperial expansion and certainly not one of 
national reunificationa€l

I do not claim to understand Russian politics, or what is going on in the mind of Vladimir Putin. 
But this is, at least, interesting:

Nina L. Khrushcheva: The Origins ofPutina€™s Totalitarianism'. a€~Putin used to listen to siloviki 
like Sechin and Chemezov, and even delegated critical functions to associates. Now, he dictates 
policy without entertaining alternative views, delegating implementation to government technocrats, 
led by the robotic prime minister, Mikhail Mishustina€!. These new pillars of the apparatus of 
state control are impersonal entities with a
singular focus: cleansing the political space of anything anti-Kremlina€! punishing those who fail 
to show sufficient a€celoyalty.a€D Unlike the siloviki, they do not counsel Putina€!. Instead, they 
blindly pursue Putina€™ s goal of securing total controla€!

In the 1800s, the fight between the left and the righta€’’between the business-class and the 
aristocracy Dash was over whether the aristocracy would be able to preserve its forms of social 
power against the corrosive hegemonic workings of the market economy, which sought to dissolve all 
forms of social power except those based on property rights, with the only property rights worth 
anything those that enabled the production of things in high demand and
inelastic supply. For the working class, without property rights, is society in which social power 
rested on property rights and only property rights was not terribly attractive. Thus the right 
could find a mass base by arguing to the working class that both benefited from curbing the market 
and supporting other sources of social power. Hence a Bismarck had strong incentives to pursue 
a€oestate socialista€D policies that actually workeda€”that redistributed wealth
from the bourgeoisie to the working class. Yet Ron De Santis does not appear to see himself as 
bound by similar incentives:

Charlie Sykes: a€oeA Willingness To Do Harmd€n a€~In the pasta€! a€oethe threat of economic damage 
acted as a brake on a governora€™ s willingness to use state power to attack his enemies, but 
thata€™ s less true today .a€Da€! Texas Governor Greg Abbotta€™ s decision to create a massive 
traffic jam at the border by insisting on special a€ceinspectionsa€D of trucks crossing the 
bordera€!. Ron DeSantis has launched an
attack against the statea€™ s largest employera€!. Even in an age of deplorable, toxic, and 
increasingly tribal politics, this seems to cross a line that most politicians used to recognize: 
attack your political opponents, but not your own economy. Wreak vengeance on your enemies, but 
dona€™ t take it out on your own taxpayers, voters, employers, or workersa€!

I think Branko is highly, highly over optimistic here. Is thesis is that the Russian 
oligarchsa€”the haut bourgeoisie^.”did not exercise their power and push strongly for the rule of 
law because they believed they had external boltholes. Since you can always exit to Cyprus if 
things get bad, why run the risks of using your voice and getting involved in messy and sharp-edged 
internal Russian politics? His hope is a hope, but I think it is a vain one:

Branko Milanovic: The Lessons & Implications of Seizing Russian Oligarchsa€™ Assets: a€~But what 
are the implications of the seizure of assets?a€! The global implication is that foreign plutocrats 
who often moved their money from their own countries to the a€oesafe havensa€D of the US, UK and

because they will have no longer any place where to move their wealtha€!
