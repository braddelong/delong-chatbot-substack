He accuses humanists of being technocrats, with the only difference that being that the humanist technocrats they choos—people like Homer, Hume, and Hofstadter—claim to have a different kind of knowledge then do the high priests of engineering and cost-benefit analysis. In my view, knowledge of the people in the second class is indeed here is how we solve <em>these certain classes of problems</em>. The knowledge, however, of the people in the first class is of a very different order: it is, rather, <em>here are psychological and historical narratives about the problems that people have faced, and how they have tried and usually failed to solve them</em>.

Much of the literature of this period was religious in nature, but that is no reason to dismiss it (far more of the literature of the Classical world was religious in nature than you likely think, by the by). St. Augustine of Hippo was writing during the fifth century; indeed his The City of God, one of the foundational works of Christian literature, was written in response to the news of the sack of Rome in 410.

Pope Gregory I (540–604) was also a prolific writer, writing hundreds of letters, a collection of four books of dialogues, a life of St. Benedict, a book on the role of bishops, a commentary on the Book of Job and so on.

VSPs face less incentive either to second guess their errors as they are making them, or to think through their errors after they have made them, because collective structures reinforce their tendency to think that they are right in the first instance, and their tendency to think that they ought to have been right (if it weren’t for those inconvenient facts/specific and contingent circumstances that meant that things didn’t go quite as predicted just this once) in the second…. Democracy when it works… harnesses mulishness and rancorous dispute to reveal… information… latent in the disagreements…. When certain people’s perspectives are privileged, the value of democracy is weakened….

Apple’s iMessage Is Actually a Failure</em>: ‘iMessage’s role is to provide a solid, end-to-end encrypted service for the Apple ecosystem that (secondarily) can coexist with SMS messages…. It works. It’s better than anything Google has attempted. The problem is, it’s not good enough…. The reason that I consider iMessage more of a failure than success is all about its slow pace of development and poor choices, especially compared with the WhatsApps and WeChats of the world…. Apple recently introduced replies and mentions to iMessage. They’re… not great? But I appreciate the attempt. I hope Apple is working on new tweaks to improve the experience–but my fear is that it will just walk away from that feature, too, and it’ll sit there being not-quite-right for all eternity. Which is not to say that Apple hasn’t had its successes with iMessage. Apple Pay Cash (again, only available in the U.S.!) is pretty great, and I use it all the time. And Tapbacks might be Apple’s single best iMessage feature ever. But even when Apple gets a clear iMessage win, it ends up muddy…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/606152/imessage-google-green-bubbles-sms-rcs.html">https://www.macworld.com/article/606152/imessage-google-green-bubbles-sms-rcs.html</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Josh Barro</strong>: <em>Here’s What I Mean When I Say Biden Should ‘Focus on the Economy’</em>: ‘Here are some things the president is doing, and some things he should be doing or should be doing better, to address the supply crunch, bring prices down, and make goods and services more available in a short enough time frame to matter politically: Issue visas for more workers….

Gathered here, from all quarters of the globe by a common aspiration for rational liberty as against caste, divine right governments and privileged classes… it would be madness to set up any one race above another, or one religion above another, or proscribe any on account of race color or creed…. Though they come as the waves come, we shall be stronger if we receive them as friends and give them a reason for loving our country and our institutions…. The points of human difference, great as they, upon first sight, seem, are as nothing compared with the points of human agreement. Such contact would remove mountains of prejudice…. The voice of civilization speaks an unmistakable language against the isolation of families, nations and races, and pleads for composite nationality as essential to her triumphs…</p></blockquote><p>This is a perfect example of what I call the <em><strong>Massachusetts</strong></em> strain of American nationalism.</p><p>Another example is to be found in George Kennan’s article on <em>The Sources of Soviet Conduct</em>:</p><blockquote><p>The possibilities for American policy are by no means limited to holding the line and hoping for the best…. It is rather a question of the degree to which the United States can create among the peoples of the world generally the impression of a country which knows what it wants, which is coping successfully with the problems of its internal life and with the responsibilities of a World Power, and which has a spiritual vitality capable of holding its own among the major ideological currents of the time…. The palsied decrepitude of the capitalist world is the keystone of Communist philosophy…. Exhibitions of indecision, disunity and in- ternal disintegration within this country have an exhilarating effect on the whole Communist movement….</p><p>Thus the decision will really fall in large measure in this country itself. The issue of Soviet-American relations is in essence a test of the over-all worth of the United States as a nation among nations. To avoid destruction the United States need only measure up to its own best traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation. Surely, there was never a fairer test of national quality than this…. The thoughtful observer… will find no cause for complaint in the Kremlin's challenge to American society. He will rather experience a certain gratitude to a Providence which, by providing the American people with this implacable challenge, has made their entire security as a nation dependent on their pulling themselves together and accepting the responsibilities of moral and political leadership that history plainly intended them to bear.</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="http://slantchev.ucsd.edu/courses/pdf/Kennan%20-%20The%20Sources%20of%20Soviet%20Conduct.pdf">http://slantchev.ucsd.edu/courses/pdf/Kennan%20-%20The%20Sources%20of%20Soviet%20Conduct.pdf</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>And I have a perfect example of the <em><strong>Kentucky</strong></em> strain of American nationalism—that only frontiersmen who reject urbanity, civilization, and book-larnin’ for the survivalist arts of self-reliance are really Americans: &lt;<a href="https://www.bradford-delong.com/2019/02/the-kentucky-strain-of-american-nationalism-from-j-william-ward-andrew-jackson-symbol-for-an-age/comments/">https://www.bradford-delong.com/2019/02/the-kentucky-strain-of-american-nationalism-from-j-william-ward-andrew-jackson-symbol-for-an-age/comments/</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/andrewjacksonsym0000unse">https://archive.org/details/andrewjacksonsym0000unse</a>&gt;.</p><p>But I do not have a good example of the <em><strong>Virginia</strong></em> strand—the strand that is neither A Holy People Building Utopia Together Here in the New World nor A Special People Trained by the Frontier, but rather the Dammit I Can Do What I Want and Nobody Else—No Government, No Neighbor—Can Stop Me.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p><p>I very much want to write an article on these three strands of American nationalism, and I will be unable to write a good one—or even to give a good American-nationalism lecture—until I find a good example and representative for the Virginia strand.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: glc comments:</p><blockquote><p>Patrick Henry?
