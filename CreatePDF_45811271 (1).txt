First: Against Meritocracy:

If you have a test or another activity to select who is a€oethe besta€D, you had better make damned 
sure that the test or activity accurately measures or reflects what you really want done. In the 
limit, you optimize for test-takersa€”and people who have devoted all of their time to become 
expert test-takers have spent none of their time learning to do anything else. They
are thus likely to be far from a€oethe besta€D at what will be their real job.

How can you tell if you are falling into this trap? Divide your population up into groups. See how 
well the best test-takers are spread out among those groups, If there is no reason to think that 
those who will actually be best at the real job are anything other than uniformly distributed among 
the groups you have chosen, and yet if it turns out that those who score highest
on the test are strongly concentrateda€”then it is highly likely that you are missing huge numbers 
of potential candidates, and wasting a huge amount of talent.

Rajiv Sethi ran across a very interesting paper on Finland that is on point here:

Notes on a Remarkable Finding from Finland

I recently came across a paper by Ursina Schaede and Ville Mankki that contains a fascinating 
empirical finding with major implications for the way in which we think about meritocracy. The 
paper examines the long run effects on students of a change in the manner in which their teachers 
were selected into a graduate program. Finland is well known for hava€!

This is actually a pretty good typology of "institutions", encompassing norms (conventions vs

Luke Muehlhauser: How Big a Deal Was the Industrial Revolution?'. a€~Gains and losses in (these 
measures of) human well-being during the pre-industrial era are miniscule compared to the gains 
made during the post-industrial era, and there is a sharp upward trajectory change for all these 
measures shortly after 1800. This provides a qualitative, as well as loosely
quantitative picture of the magnitude of change I have in mind when I speak of 
a€oetransformativea€n changea€!. To many readers, it will not be a surprise that such a 
transformative change occurred shortly after the industrial revolution. What is perhaps more 
surprising is to consider how many major historical events seem to have not produced anything close 
to such a
transformative changea€!. No other transitions in recorded history are remotely comparablea€!

I am still noodling around, wondering what to say in my first Economic History lecture to the 
graduate students later this month. One possibility:

Post-Neolithic Revolution Watershed-Boundary Crossings in Human Economic History

I, at least, see five important watershed-boundary crossings in the economic history of the past 
8000 years.

(1) The first watershed-boundary crossing comes immediately after the Neolithic Revolution, with 
the coming of a€cecivilizationa€D about the year -5000. Before then, humans were indeed anthology 
intelligencesa€”what one person knew, as soon pretty much everyone in the band knew, because of our 
incredible and sometimes regrettable compulsion to talk and
gossip even when we know it will not be a to our long-run advantage. But they were short-run 
short-distance anthology intelligences, knowledge is limited and evanescent: what one band new had 
a hard time diffusing over great distances, and what was not immediately useful could and did decay 
and be lost over the centuries. With civilization and more so with writing,
we became a global-scale time-binding singular anthology intelligence. And that mattered greatly.

From year -5000 to year -1, we could see more people chattering and communicating leading to faster 
advances in ideas. Faster advances in useful ideas supported faster population growth through 
Malthusian forces. Faster population growth produced a greater human population base. That in turn 
produced more         chattering and communicatingand even faster advances  in
ideas. We thus think we have a human population with a proportional growth rate that more than 
doubles from 0.03%/year to 0.06%/year, comparing the -3000 to -1000 Bronze Age with the -1000 to 1 
Iron Age, what some call the a€oe Axial Agea€U of humanity.

(2) But then there comes a second watershed-boundary crossing. It comes not after 1 but rather 
after 170: the Late-Antiquity Pause. We do not see another doubling of the rate of ideas and of 
population growth. Instead, after 170a€! things kinda fall apart. Dark Ages. Imperial decline and 
fall. Barbarian invasions.         Emperors desperateto protect their realms making unwise
deals with barbarian warlords with names like Alaric the Visigoth and An Lushan the Sogdian. Rather 
than a breakthrough out of Malthusian near-stagnation, the years from 1 to 800 see a decline in the 
ideas growth rate back to 0.016% per year, Apparently slower than anything seen since the -5000 
coming of a€oecivilizationa€n.

But after 800 things recover. We think we see, worldwide, the same proportional ideas growth rate 
from 800-1500 as we saw from -1000 to 1: 0.06%/year. And technology is at a higher level: it would 
have taken, on average, more than two workers in -1000 to do what one worker could do in 800. 
(Living standards on average did not rise, however:          with 4.5 times as many
people in 800 as had been in -1000, farm sizes were smaller.) On the other hand, even with 220 
million people around in 800, their ability to think up new useful ideas did not exceed the ability 
of the 50 million people around in -1000.

Then, in 1500 and after, comes a triple breakthrough:

(3) The third watershed-boundary crossing comes in 1500 with the arrival of the Imperial-Commercial 
Age. 1500-1770 sees a 2.5-fold amplification ideas growth over the previous Agrarian-Age norm. 
Human living standards do not rise by very mucha€’’Malthusian pressures are still strong, and so 
the little rise in typical living     standards for those not at the       sharp edge of
imperial-commercial globalization brings forth a previously unprecedented 50% rise in human 
population over the period. But 1500-1770 does see as much advance in the deployment of useful 
ideas in the human economy as over all the technological progress of the preceding 500 to 1500 
millennium.

(4) Then comes the fourth British Industrial Revolution watershed-boundary crossing around 1770, 
and the British Industrial Revolution Age 1770-1870. The already unprecedented Imperial-Commercial 
Age rate of global technological progress triples. From 1770-1870, useful and productive 
technologies for manipulating nature and organizing humans invented,
discovered, developed, deployed, and diffused across the human world economy advance so fast that a 
typical decade sees change that you would have had to wait a typical century to see over the epoch 
-1000 to 1500. The Malthusian Devil is still in control: the world population nearly doubled from 
1770 to 1870, with smaller farm sizes almost but not quite offsetting
the potential benefits better technology offered for human living standards .(5

(5) And then the fifth andsa€”so fara€”final watershed-boundary crossing around 1870, bringing us 
into our Modern Economic Growth Age. A further more-than-quadrupling of the pace of ideas growth. 
Now one typical year sees the progress that took 50 years on average over -1000 to 1500. In a 
generation human deployed and diffused technological prowess doubles.
And then in the next generation it doubles again. Such a pace of creative destruction, overturning 
the foundational technological and economic underpinnings of society, has never been seen before. 
It characterizes our age.

Then there is a natural next question: What happens next?

We think that world population is likely to top out at between 9 and 10 billion. Suppose that 
thereafter we attain zero population growth. If we suppose further that the pace of technological 
progress continues at the roughly 2%/year seen since 1870, that gives us a ca.-2100 world in which 
the typical standard of living is some $70,000 of our dollars per yeara€”the level
of, say, Greater San Francisco today. Manifestly, that is not enough wealth to build a true utopia. 
But it is enough wealth to make a society wealthy and comfortable indeed. (Although we do not know 
how much of that wealth will have to be committed to global warming adaptation and remediation.)

Another century of similar growth at a stable world population would give us a ca.-2200 world in 
which the average person lives, well, better than I do: an average could with $1,000,000 a year to 
devote to their projects and goals. I can see, barely, how a typical person could use such wealth.

But project forward another 300 yearsa€”if technological progress has not come to a stop there is 
no more fruit, even high-hanging fruit, to be pickeda€”and we see a ca.-2500 world in which the 
typical living standard is not far from $200,000,000 a year, and in which every day the typical 
person has $500,000 of resources to spend making themself comfortable and
advancing whatever their current projects might happen to be.

I really have a hard time contemplating what such a world would look likea€!

no more fruit, even high-hanging fruit, to be pickeda€”and we see a ca.-2500 world in which the 
typical living standard is not far from $200,000,000 a year, and in which every day the typical 
person has $500,000 of resources to spend making themself comfortable and
advancing whatever their current projects might happen to be.

I really have a hard time contemplating what such a world would look likea€!
