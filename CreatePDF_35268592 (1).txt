Dwight D. Eisenhower (1954a€“lla€“08): Letter to Edgar N. Eisenhower: a€~Dear Ed:

I think that such answer as I can give to your letter of November first will be arranged in reverse 
ordera€“at least I shall comment first on your final paragraph.

You keep harping on the Constitution; I should like to point out that the meaning of the 
Constitution is what the Supreme Court says it is. Consequently no powers are exercised by the 
Federal government except where such exercise is approved by the Supreme Court (lawyers) of the 
land.[l]

I admit that the Supreme Court has in the past made certain decisions in this general field that 
have been astonishing to me. A recent case in point was the decision in the Phillips case.[2] 
Others, and older ones, involved a€oeinterstate commerce.a€d [3] But until some future Supreme 
Court decision denies the right and responsibility of the Federal government to do certain things, 
you cannot possibly remove them from the political activities of the Federal
government.

Now it is true that I believe this country is following a dangerous trend when it permits too great 
a degree of centralization of governmental functions. I oppose thisa€“in some instances the fight 
is a rather desperate one. But to attain any success it is quite clear that the Federal government 
cannot avoid or escape responsibilities which the mass of the people firmly believe should be 
undertaken by it. The political processes of our country are such that if a rule of
reason is not applied in this effort, we will lose e very thinga€ “even to a possible and drastic 
change in the Constitution. This is what I mean by my constant insistence upon a€cemoderationa€D in 
government. Should any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment insurance, 
and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political 
history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you
can do these things. Among them are H. L. Hunt (you possibly know his background), a few other 
Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other areas.[4] Their 
number is negligible and they are stupid.

To say, therefore, that in some instances the policies of this Administration have not been 
radically changed from those of the last is perfectly true.[5] Both Administrations levied taxes, 
both maintained military establishments, customs officials, and so on.
But in all governmental fields of action a combination of purpose, procedure and objectives must be 
considered if you are to get a true evaluation of the relative merits.

You say that the foreign policy of the two Administrations is the same. I suppose that even the 
most violent critic would agree that it is well for us to have friends in the world, to encourage 
them to oppose communism both in its external form and in its internal manifestations, to promote 
trade in the world that would be mutually profitable between us and our friends (and it must be 
mutually profitable or it will dry up), and to attempt the promotion of peace in
the world, negotiating from a position of moral, intellectual, economic and military strength.

No matter what the party is in power, it must perforce follow a program that is related to these 
general purposes and aspirations. But the great difference is in how it is done and, particularly, 
in the results achieved.

A year ago last January we were in imminent danger of losing Iran, and sixty percent of the known 
oil reserves of the world. You may have forgotten this. Lots of people have. But there has been no 
greater threat that has in recent years overhung the free world. That threat has been largely, if 
not totally, removed. I could name at least a half dozen other spots of the same character.

This being true, how can anyone be so unaware of what is happening as to say that this 
Administration has conducted foreign affairs under the same policies as did the former 
Administration? As a matter of fact, if you will press any individual who brings to you all these 
strictures and comments, I venture that your experience will be the same as mine. That experience 
is that these individuals have no idea of what the a€oeforeign policy a€D of the previous
Administration was and what the present one is. They have heard certain slogans, such as a€oegive 
away programs .a€D They have no slightest idea as to what has been the effect of these programs in 
sustaining American security and prosperity. Moreover, they have no idea whatsoever as to 
comparative size of them now as compared to even two or three years ago.

You say that these critics also complain about the continuance of a€decontrols,a€D presumably over 
our economy. There is nothing in your letter that shows such complete ignorance as to what has 
actually happened as does this term. When we came into office there were Federal controls exercised 
over prices, wages, rents, as well as over the allocation and use of raw materials. The first thing 
this Administration did was to set about the elimination of those
controls. This it did amid the most dire predictions of disaster, a€cerun awaya€D inflation, and so 
on and so on. We were proved right, but I must say that if the people of the United States do not 
even remember what took place, one is almost tempted to regret the agony of study, analysis and 
decision that was then our daily ration.

You also talk about a€oebad political advicea€D I am getting. I always assumed that lawyers 
attempted accuracy in their statements. How do you know that I am getting any political advice? 
Next, if I do get political advice, how do you know that it is not weighted in the direction that 
you seem to think it should bea€“although I am tempted at times to believe that you are just 
thrashing around rather than thinking anything through to a definite conclusion? So
how can you say I am getting a€cebada€D advice; why dona€™ t you just assume I am stupid, trying to 
wreck the nation, and leave our Constitution in tatters?

I assure you that you have more reason, based on sixty-four years of contact, to say this than you 
do to make the bland assumption that I am surrounded by a group of Machiavellian characters who are 
seeking the downfall of the United States and the ascendancy of socialism and communism in the 
world. Incidentally, I notice that everybody seems to be a great Constitutionalist until his idea 
of what the Constitution ought to do is violateda€“then he suddenly
becomes very strong for amendments or some peculiar and individualistic interpretation of his own.

Finally, I must assure you again that I am delighted to get your own honest criticisms, 
particularly if you will only take the trouble to lay down the facts on which you reach what seem 
to me to be some remarkable conclusions. But the mere repetition of aphorisms and political slogans 
and newspaper headlines leaves me cold. I am sorry you are not going to be at Abilene.[6] It would 
be easier to tell you these things than to write thema€“except that by this
method I hope to make you do a little thinking rather than devote yourself just to the winning of a 
noisy argument.

As ever

P.S. I attach a paragraph and a cartoon that came to me in the same mail as did your letter. At 
least it represents a different viewpoint. Incidentally, it comes from one of the most successful 
businessmen in the nation.

1. a€oel have faith in your inherent desire to operate this country on a constitutional basis,a€D 
Edgar had written, a€cegiving to the states what are legitimately their rights, and assuming for 
the Federal Government only those limited powers which the Constitution intended that it should 
have.a€D

2. On June 7 the Supreme Court had ruled that sales of natural gas by the Phillips Petroleum 
Company to pipelines that distribute it in interstate commerce were subject to regulation by the 
Federal Power Commission. This decision gave the FPC control of a domain traditionally reserved to 
the states (Phillips Petroleum Co. v. State of Wisconsin et al. 347 U.S. 672 (1954)). Eisenhower 
deleted from this section of his earlier draft the following sentence:
a€oel think there has been some tortuous reasoning applied.a€D

3. See for example Wickard v. Filburn, a case that upheld the federal governmentaC™ s power to 
regulate farm production even when no part of the product was intended for interstate commerce and 
the product was consumed on the farm where it was grown (317 U.S. Ill (1942)).

4. Haroldson Lafayette Hunt, billionaire founder of the Hunt Oil Company, had often been a champion 
of conservative causes. For background on Eisenhowera€™ s relations with Hunt see Galambos, 
Columbia University, vol. X.

5. a€oeFor your information,a€D Edgar had written, a€oethere are a great many people in all walks 
of fife with whom I have talked, who have made the statement that there is very little difference 
between the policy of your administration and that of the former administrationa€n in the handling 
of foreign relations and many domestic programs.
