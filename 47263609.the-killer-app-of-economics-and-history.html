No I want the class to not learn but rather use a bunch of the conclusions of this growth theory. Thus I am taking the second week to either review, remind, or give the bottom line conclusions‚Äîdepending on what they bring to the course.</p><p>So I want to be reassuring. But I don‚Äôt think this draft piece from my lecture notes is really going to reassure group #2:</p><blockquote><p>In the Basic Solow Growth Model, the equilibrium economists look for is an equilibrium in which the economy‚Äôs capital-output ratio ùúÖŒ∫ is contant, and thus the capital stock per worker, the level of income and output per worker, and the efficiency of labor are all three growing at exactly the same proportional rate‚Äîa rate that remains constant over time. We will call this rate g, for growth.</p><p>Is this going by at bewildering speed? Blame it on the fact that our curriculum here in Economics is not well-designed. We want you to have the tools of economic theory to use here in this course. But we don't have time to build them from scratch. So we skate over the surface‚Äîproviding a quick review to those of you who have taken Econ 100b before, and a skating-over-the-surface to those of you who have not.</p><p>Remember: we do not want you to understand the conclusions of these models and theories‚Äîwe merely want you to know those conclusions, take them for now on faith, and use them.</p><div><hr></div><p>As my teacher's teacher, the Nobel Prize-winning economic historian Robert Fogel once said, the killer app of history (and economics) is counting things.</p><p>Math is basically all about counting things. But we are very lucky, in that we stand on the shoulders of giants who have figured out how to and transmitted to us the knowledge of how to count things in incredibly powerful ways.</p><p>One such giant whose shoulders we stand on is Mu·∏•ammad ibn M≈´sƒÅ al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ (c. 780-850). The first part of his name is simply "Muhammad, son of Moses". The second part? It is the answer to the question: "OK. But which Mu·∏•ammad ibn M≈´sƒÅ wandering around Baghdad in the early 800s during the reign of the Kalif al-Mamun are we talking about?‚Äù The answer was: "the one who came here from KhwƒÅrizm, and who works at the House of Wisdom established by the Kalif".</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f2c6632-0e70-41f0-96a1-175c4f0baaad_1510x1052.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f2c6632-0e70-41f0-96a1-175c4f0baaad_1510x1052.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f2c6632-0e70-41f0-96a1-175c4f0baaad_1510x1052.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f2c6632-0e70-41f0-96a1-175c4f0baaad_1510x1052.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f2c6632-0e70-41f0-96a1-175c4f0baaad_1510x1052.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9f2c6632-0e70-41f0-96a1-175c4f0baaad_1510x1052.png" width="1456" height="1014" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9f2c6632-0e70-41f0-96a1-175c4f0baaad_1510x1052.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1014,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2139561,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f2c6632-0e70-41f0-96a1-175c4f0baaad_1510x1052.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f2c6632-0e70-41f0-96a1-175c4f0baaad_1510x1052.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f2c6632-0e70-41f0-96a1-175c4f0baaad_1510x1052.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f2c6632-0e70-41f0-96a1-175c4f0baaad_1510x1052.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>When Italians heard "al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´", they mangled it into <strong>algorithm</strong>. Every time you say <strong>algorithm</strong>, you are saying that you are undertaking the kind of step-by-step analysis that Mu·∏•ammad ibn M≈´sƒÅ al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ taught us to do. Hew as the author of: <em>Al-KitƒÅb al-Mukhta·π£ar fƒ´ HisƒÅb al-Jabr wa‚Äôl-Mu·∏≥ƒÅbala‚ÄîThe Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing</em></p><p>It was his work on how to repeatedly and rapidly do large numbers of similar and related calculations that allowed us to turn simple counting into the mathematics of "what-if?" machines. We ask the question "what-if?" And we then answer it be doing a large number of calculations about what might be at once, seeing which of these calculations produce ansers that satisfy whatever the consistency and coherence conditions we have imposed are, and then summarizing the results of all of them in a very small space. It becomes complicated and very hard to remember and opaque very quickly. But, at the bottom, it is just counting.</p><p>Listen to physicist Richard Feynman, about how his QED theory of the interaction of light and matter‚Äîa theory that has been tested and is correct at unbelievably precise scales. As of 1985:</p><blockquote><p>Experiments have Dirac's number at 1.00115965221 (with an uncertainty of about 4 in the last digit); the theory puts it at 1.00115965246 (with an uncertainty of about five times as much). To give you a feeling for the accuracy of these numbers, it comes out something like this: If you were to measure the distance from Los Angeles to New York to this accuracy, it would be exact to the thickness of a human hair...</p></blockquote><p>No doubt experiments and calcuations since have sharpened both of those, and they are still in agreement.</p><p>Feynman, talking about this "Feynman Diagram" theory of his, said:</p><blockquote><p>An analogy‚Ä¶. The Maya Indians were interested in‚Ä¶ [when they would be able to see the War-Star] Venus‚Ä¶. To make calculations, the Maya had invented a system of bars and dots to represent numbers‚Ä¶ and had rules by which to calculate and predict not only the risings and settings of Venus, but other celestial phenomena‚Ä¶.</p><p>Only a few Maya priests could do such elaborate calculations‚Ä¶.</p><p>Suppose we were to ask one of them how to do just one step in the process of predicting when Venus will next rise as a morning star‚Äîsubtracting two numbers‚Ä¶.. How would the priest explain?‚Ä¶.</p><p>He could either teach us the‚Ä¶ bars and dots and the rule‚Ä¶ or he could tell us what he was really doing:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose we want to subtract 236 from 584. First, count out 584 beans and put them in a pot. Then take out 236 beans and put them to one side. Finally, count the beans left in the pot. That number is the result‚Ä¶.</p></blockquote><p>You might say, ‚ÄòMy Quetzalcoatl! What tedium‚Ä¶ what a job!‚Äô</p><p>To which the priest would reply,</p><blockquote><p>That‚Äôs why we have the rules‚Ä¶. The rules are tricky, but they are a much more efficient way of getting the answer‚Ä¶. We can predict the appearance of Venus by counting beans (which is slow, but easy to understand) or by using the tricky rules (which is much faster, but you must spend years in school to learn them)...</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>We stand on the shoulders of myriad upon myriad of armies of giants. All we have to do is to build in our brains a filing system so we can remember how to utilize the conclusions of all the work they have gifted us with, trusting that they were indeed giants and knew how to do their job.</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Audio:</h2><p><strong>Noah Smith</strong>: <em>Interview: Ryan Petersen, Founder &amp; CEO of Flexport</em>: ‚ÄòThe supply chain crunch, modern logistics, and that famous trip around the Port of Long Beach‚Ä¶ &lt;<a href="https://noahpinion .substack.com/p/interview-ryan-petersen-ceo-of-flexport">https://noahpinion .substack.com/p/interview-ryan-petersen-ceo-of-flexport</a>&gt;: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:45887776,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/interview-ryan-petersen-ceo-of-flexport&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:35345,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Noahpinion&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/04281755-2cd6-42e5-a496-e69153abebb2_281x281.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Interview: Ryan Petersen, founder and CEO of Flexport&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;For the last year or so, the global economy has been hammered by a massive supply chain crunch.

Due to these constraints, the intuitive view of perception in real-time is impossible to implement. I propose a new way of thinking about real-time perception, in which perceptual mechanisms represent a timeline, rather than a single timepoint. In this proposal, predictive mechanisms predict ahead to compensate for neural delays, and work in tandem with postdictive mechanisms that revise the timeline as additional sensory information becomes available. Building on recent theoretical, computational, psychophysical, and functional neuroimaging evidence, this conceptualisation of real-time perception for the first time provides an integrated explanation for how we can experience the present‚Ä¶</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661321002886">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661321002886</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Liam Bright</strong>: <em>‚ÄôMy somewhat more detailed sense of the present balance of forces</em> in something like The Typical Anglo-American University. The largest group, and not only numerically largest but over represented in positions of senior authority, are what I would call Generic Libs, left of centre but not especially so. Probably basically like Kier Starmer and Elizabeth Warren. They don‚Äôt understand and vaguely fear and resent woke students, who they think of as something like the mob in a Victor Hugo novel (the TV show The Chair captured this vibe well). One way in which I‚Äôm a culture war centrist is I think the university is simultaneously full of insufferable baby-wokes who discovered Politics in 2016 and have been awful ever since, and also resentful mediocrities who blame feminism for their inadequacy. We contain multitudes. The next next biggest group are the woke. Disproportionately represented among students and junior faculty you‚Äôd not naturally think it‚Äôs gonna be an especially powerful group. But they have four things going for them. 1. There‚Äôs often a power base for them in administration, as office for diversity (etc) often has more soft power than official position in the hierarchy suggests. 2. Some humanities disciplines ensure they will have representation at senior faculty level. 3. They have friends in the press so can credibly threaten bad publicity. 4. Most of all, they have asabiyya. They have the energy and solidarity of young people who believe in what they‚Äôre doing and why. This group feeling lets them achieve more than their often quite junior official positions would suggest. Third are resentful anti-wokes. Smaller in number than either previous group they usually feel a bit beleaguered. But they have three things going for them. 1. To get anything done you have to go via first group. The second group achieved that through fear. That works ok, but the anti-wokes thereby automatically get some institutional sympathy, as no one likes being pushed around and that‚Äôs how the generic libs feel when confronted by the woke kids. 2. They also have friends in the press, so have a similar credibly threat to the second group. 3. They have allies with formal political power, and Deans are very aware of the need to fend off right populist attack. There are of course other factions and interest groups, some of which can get a lot done, but Culture War wise these are the significant groupings‚Ä¶</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/lastpositivist/status/1485322889880645638&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;My somewhat more detailed sense of the present balance of forces in something like The Typical Anglo-American University.

As a result, here‚Äôs what things look like <em>since June 30th</em> for each. First, here‚Äôs what cumulative <em>case</em> rates from 6/30/21 - 1/21/22 look like broken out into 10 equal-population 2-dose vaccination deciles. As you can see, Omicron has completely cancelled out the prior trend‚Ä¶ all 10 brackets have virtually identical <em>case</em> rates now. But here‚Äôs the kicker: Even with virtually identical <em>infection rates</em> in all 10 brackets, the <em>death</em> rate is still 4x higher in the least-vaccinated tenth of the country than the most-vaccinated tenth. I‚Äôll have more on both trends and where they‚Äôre likely headed going forward soon. None of this actually surprises me, but I did a double take to see the case rate run virtually even across all 10 deciles at the same time‚ÄìI figured there‚Äôd be more variance even as they shift. Two other important caveats to keep in mind: 1. These graphs include Delta <em>and</em> Omicron combined; they look very different separately (I‚Äôll include Omicron only on a Monday blog post) 2. The vaxx data is based on 2-DOSE vaccinations; it does <em>not</em> include Booster data yet‚Ä¶</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2"
