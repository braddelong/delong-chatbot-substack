PODCAST: Hexapodia XV: No-Bullshit Democracy, Starring

Henrv


Key Insights:


Share

1. Henry: We need to be critical of other people in the public sphere, but we need to be critical 
in an extraordinarily humble waya€”to recognize that we, all of us, are incredibly biased as 
individuals. We see the moats in our brothers' eyes very well. We do not see the beams and our own. 
We have a duty to others to try to help them to remove the beams in a polite, quiet, sometimes 
insistent way... think very carefully about the ways in which we can
genuinely be constructive in criticism...

2. Brad: We are in huge trouble: organizing our 7.8 billion person anthology intelligence to 
actually get done what we need to get done in the next century appears beyond our capabilities. It 
may be time to go back to the trees, or even to devolve completely and let some other more mature 
species more capable of collective action and organization come upa€”the raccoons, or something. 
Nobody has a gospel. So the next move has to be, somehow, with
the head...

3. Noah: Perhaps this is just the optimism of relative youth but I think that we're going to break 
out of our local maximum and find a better way. If you were in the 1930s, and you looked at the 
state of both America and the world, you would see even more cause for despair. Yet we got our way 
out of that without having to leave the planet to the raccoons. I think we will this time as well. 
The key insight is that we are still in the process of learning about
what democracy means and about how, you know, humans can participate in their own government 
without turning it into an unwieldy shout fest.

4. All: Hexapodia!

5. PJS.: Marko Kloos's Paladium Wars <https://www.amazon.com/The-Palladium-Wars/dp/B086CYB6VS> 
series is excellent.

Alexander Hamilton: a€~It is impossible to read the history of the petty republics of Greece and 
Italy without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the distractions with which they were 
continually agitated, and at the rapid succession of revolutions by which they were kept in a state 
of perpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy. If they exhibit occasional 
calms, these only serve as short-lived contrast to the furious storms that are to
succeed. If now and then intervals of felicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of 
regret, arising from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed 
by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from 
the gloom, while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time 
admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction
and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils 
that produced them have been so justly celebrated.

From the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics the advocates of despotism have 
drawn arguments, not only against the forms of republican government, but against the very 
principles of civil liberty. They have decried all free government as inconsistent with the order 
of society, and have indulged themselves in malicious exultation over its friends and partisansa€!. 
It is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched of republican
government were too just copies of the originals from which they were taken. If it had been found 
impracticable to have devised models of a more perfect structure, the enlightened friends to 
liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that species of government as indefensible.

The science of politics, however, like most other sciences, has received great improvement. The 
efficacy of various principles is now well understood, which were either not known at all, or 
imperfectly known to the ancients. The regular distribution of power into distinct departments; the 
introduction of legislative balances and checks; the institution of courts composed of judges 
holding their offices during good behavior; the representation of the people in the
legislature by deputies of their own election: these are wholly new discoveries, or have made their 
principal progress towards perfection in modern times. They are means, and powerful means, by which 
the excellences of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or 
avoideda€!

Henry Farrell, Hugo Mercier, & Melissa Schwartzberg: No-Bullshit Democracy: dCONtr the last decade 
a prominent academic literature tied to libertarian thought has argued that democracy is generally 
inferior to other forms of collective problem-solving such as markets and the rule of cognitive 
elites (Caplan 2007, Somin 2016, Brennan 2016). These skeptics appeal to findings in cognitive and 
social psychology, and political behavior, to claim that
decision-making by ordinary citizens is unlikely to be rational or well-grounded in evidence. Their 
arguments have received prominent media coverage (Crain 2016), and have been repeated in 
conservative critiques of democratic voting (Mathis-Lilley 2021), while provoking rejoinders from 
political theorists whose a€ceepistemica€D account of the benefits of democracy invokes mechanisms 
such as deliberation, the Condorcet Jury Theorem, and the
a€oeDiversity Trumps Abilitya€D theorem (Landemore 2013; Schwartzberg 2015).

This debate has been largely unproductivea€!. We set out a different approach. We show that 
democratic skepticsa€™ claims tend to rest on partial, inaccurate, and outdated understandings of 
human cognition. However, we do not retort with a general defense of democracy on cognitive or 
epistemological grounds. Instead, we advocate a scientific program investigating the conditions 
under which specific democratic institutions do better or worse in discovering
solutions to collective problems, building in particular on results in experimental psychologya€!
