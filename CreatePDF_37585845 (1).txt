The plague year is not over. It may be only half-over, depending on what Delta and subsequent 
variants do:

Bob Wachter: Covid (@UCSF) Chronicles, Day 453: a€~I know everybodya€™ s sick of playing 
3-dimensional Covid chess. Sorry, but the Delta variant forces us back to the chess boarda€!. If 
youa€™re fully vaxxed, I wouldna€™t be too worried, especiallya€! in a highly vaxxed regiona€!. If 
youa€™re not vaccinated: Ia€™d be afraid.
Maybe even very afraida€i. Sadly, ~50% of the U.S. (>age 12) remains unvaccinated, and in certain 
states (mostly southern & right-leaning), ita€™ s more like 2/3rdsa€!. This is the most dangerous 
moment to be unvaccinateda€!. The virusa€! is better at infecting peoplea€!. 3 thingsa€! about 
variantsa€! a) are they more infectious? b) are they
more serious? (ie, are you likelier to get very sick) & c) are they vaccine (or prior Covid-based 
immunity) resistant?a€! For Delta, Pfizer dose 1 is only ~33% protectivea€!. What to do? For a 
vaccinated person, watch the Delta %a€!. If youa€™re seeing more cases & more Delta, Ia€™d restore 
some precautionsa€! indoor mask wearinga€!. If
youa€™re unvaxxed, get your shots!a€! If your strategy was a€oela€™ 11 consider a shot if I see an 
uptick in cases,a€D thata€™ s also a loser, since once a surge begins, you wona€™ t be well 
protected against Delta for 4a€“6 weeksa€!. For unvaxxed, I wish you well but my sympathy is 
flagging. Your bad choice is looking worsea€!

Paragraphs:

David Glasner: Ralph Hawtrey Wrote the Book that Arthur Burns Should Have Reada€”but Didna€™ t: 
a€~Here are the critical missteps of Burnsa€™ s unfortunate tenurea€!. Yielding to Nixona€™ s 
demands for an easing of monetary policy, Burns eased monetary policy sufficiently to allow a 
modest recovery to get under way in 1971. But the recovery was too
tepid to suit Nixon. Fearing the inflationary implications of a further monetary loosening, Burns 
began publicly lobbying for the adoption of an incomes policy to limit the increase of wages set by 
collective bargaining between labor unions and major businessesa€!. On August 15,1971 Nixon imposed 
a 90-day freeze on all wages and prices to be followed by
comprehensive wage-and-price controls. With controls in place, Burns felt secure in accelerating 
the rate of monetary expansion, leaving it to those controlling wages and prices to keep inflation 
within acceptable boundsa€!. By Q4 1973, inflation rose to 7%, a rate only marginally affected by 
the Arab oil embargo on oil shipments to the United States and a general
reduction     in oil output, which led to a quadrupling of oil prices by early 1974. The sharp 
oil-price increase simultaneously caused inflation to rise sharply above the 7% rate it had reached 
at the end of 1973 even as it caused a deep downturn and recession in the first quarter of 1974a€!. 
These mistakes all stemmed from a failure by Burns to understand the rationale of an
incomes policy. Burns was not alone in that failure, which was actually widespread at the time. But 
the rationale for such a policy and the key to its implementation had already been spelled out 
cogently by Ralph Hawtreya€!. What Burns evidently didna€™ t understand, or chose to ignore, was 
that adopting an incomes policy to restrain wage increases did not allow the
monetary authority to implement a monetary policy that would cause nominal GDP to rise at a rate 
faster than was consistent with full employment at the target rate of inflationa€!. What Burns 
might have learned from Hawtrey was that even if some form of control of wages was essential for 
maintaining full employment in an economic environment in which strong
labor unions could bargain effectively with employers, that control over wages did nota€”and could 
nota€”free the central bank from its responsibility to control aggregate demand and the growth of 
total spending and incomea€!

Lauren Bauer, Arindrajit Dube, Wendy Edelberg, & Aaron Sojourner: Examining the Uneven & 
Hard-to-Predict Labor Market Recovery. a€~Any effects of expanded unemployment insurance benefits 
on labor supply will dissipate quickly as the benefits expire nationally in early September and 
before then in an increasing number of states. Indeed, policymakers
should be on high-alert for whether the expiration of those benefits results in extraordinary 
financial hardship for some workers unable to find jobs. There are many signs that the U.S. labor 
market is on the mend. For example, the average net increase in payroll employment from February to 
April was over 500,000. Initial unemployment insurance claims continue to
decline. The number of unemployed people per job opening has fallen sharply. Teens are working in 
the labor market at higher rates than at any time in the past decade. Nonetheless, policymakers 
must be vigilanta€’’continuing to increase easy access to vaccines and helping to make working safe 
and rewardinga€!

Anton Howes: Is Innovation in Human Nature?'. a€™ The Industrial Revolution was caused by an 
acceleration of innovation. But how was that acceleration caused? Most theories of the 
acceleration^™ s causes assume that innovation is in human nature, that it has always been 
arounda€!. I disagree. The more I study the lives of British innovators, the more convinced
I am that innovation is not in human nature, but is instead received. People innovate because they 
are inspired to do soa€”it is an idea that is transmitted. And when people do not innovate, it is 
often simply because it never occurs to them to do so. Incentives matter too, of course. But a 
person needs to at leasta€! an improving mentalitya€! before they can choose to
innovate, before they can even take the costs and benefits of innovation into account. An 
illustration: at a conference I was at last month the attendees wore lanyards with name tags, which 
listed their names on one side. Over the course of the conference the tags would inevitably flip 
over, hiding the names. People would, when introducing themselves, periodically check
each othera€™ s tags, flipping them the right way around. But only one persona€”one single person, 
of attendees in the hundreds, had the ingenuity to write their name on the other side. To my shame, 
it wasna€™ t mea€!

Peter Orszag: Why Yellen May Be Right Not to Fear Inflation'. a€~The debate over whether prices 
will keep rising faster has overlooked a few important detailsa€!. Some prominent economists are 
concerned that the U.S. is entering an era of permanently higher inflation, but Treasury Secretary 
Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell believe the
current spike will be temporary. So far, this debate has largely been missing three dimensions: 
what the best forecasters are saying, whata€™ s happening in other countries, and steps that can be 
taken to attenuate problems in the supply chaina€!. Some inflation is to be expected as the economy 
re-opensa€!. A variety of supply-side chokeholds, from semiconductor-chip
shortages to container-shipping delays, are also putting upward pressure on prices. The hard 
question is whether higher inflation, such as we saw in April, is a blip (as Janet Yellen suggests) 
or a harbinger of a longer-term problem (as economist Larry Summers contends). The best forecasters 
are definitively on Yellena€™ s side. And they include not only the people
responsible for the leading macro-econometric models at the Federal Reserve, the Council of 
Economic Advisers and Wall Street banks. They also include a€cesuperforecastersa€D participating in 
the Good Judgment Project associated with Philip Tetlocka€!

Adam Tooze: Chartbook Newsletter #21: a€~Reading Grossmana€™ s Stalingrad and Life and Fatea€.\. 
Jameson puts it as follows: a€oeas paradoxical as it may sound, what holds his novel together as a

allowed it, improbably, to defeat Hitlera€™ s Wehrmacht and win
World War n.a€D The only question is, why a€oeimprobablya€n? That casual suggestion of contingency 
is not innocent. It concedes far too much to Western condescension, to the British and American 
intelligence analysts who scoffed at Soviet production statistics, to the German generals who 
bemoaned the victories supposedly stolen from them by Hitlera€™ s
meddling. It mistakes the essential point. What Stalingrad demonstrated was precisely that the 
unfreedom of the Soviet Union, as terrible as it was, was different from that of Nazi Germany or 
for that matter of the West precisely because it was more historically generative, more potent. It 
wrought a material, social and cultural transformation on such a vast scale that it
overturned the presumptions of historical normality. It shifted the balance of probabilities. It 
made it probable, not improbable, that the Soviet Union would win World War II. Certainly, that is 
the view of Grossman and his charactersa€!

relegates collaboration to an afterthought or, worse, dismisses it as naivea€!
