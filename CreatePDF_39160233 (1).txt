be sure, Friedmana€™ s argument that business is an economic institution and should stick to its 
economic task is well takena€!. But it is also clear that social responsibility cannot
be evaded. It is not only that the public demands it. It is not only that society needs it. The 
fact is that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers. If the
managers of our major institutions, and especially of business, do not take responsibility for the 
common good, no one else can or willa€!a€D

Compare to:

Peter F. Drucker: The Once and Future Manager. a€~The professional manager has not one job, but 
three:

a€~The first is to make economic resources economically productive. The manager has an 
entrepreneurial job, a job of moving resources from yesterday into tomorrow; a job, not
of minimizing risk, of minimizing risk, but of maximizing opportunity.

a€~Then there is a managerial or a€~administrativea€™ job of making human resources productive, of 
making people work together, bringing to a common task their individual
skills and knowledge; a job of making strengths productive and weaknesses irrelevant which is the 
purpose of organization. Organization is a machine for maximizing human
strengths.

a€~Then there is a third functiona€!. They are public. They are visible. They represent. They stand 
for something in the community. In fact, they are the only leading group in
societya€!. Managers have a public functiona€! Royal Commissions a€! the local Boy Scout troopa€!. 
within their own business by leadership and example. But they always do
discharge  it. Nothing anybody who is a manager does is private, in the sense that one can say: 
a€~This is my own affair. It does not concern anybody else. What I do is, therefore, of
no  real interest to any body. a€D Managers are on the stage, with the spotlight on thema€!

The young Peter F. Drucker was one of the more more interesting young moral philosophers in early 
1900s Vienna all of whom brushed up against one another. Peter F. Drucker,
however, then when came to the United States followed a very different trajectory (after getting 
Karl Polanyi his job at Bennington College) than any of the others. He became the
U.S.a€™ s BOSS management consultant and managerial theorist. But he remained someone who always 
hunted the same game as the Polanyis, von Hayek, Schumpeter and
company. Pinned between Schumpeter, von Hayek, Karl Polanyi, and the shadow of Karl Marx, Peter F. 
Drucker sought his reconciliation of the antinomies of modern industrial
society in the figure of the manager, whose social role was precisely to arrange things so that 
society could be an a€ reassociation, in which the free development of each is the
condition for the free development of alla€d.

Note that Drucker's manager is in many ways the polar opposite of Alasdair Macintyre's. Macintyre's 
is the pursuer of instrumental rationality on behalf of his principals, whatever
their values and interests may be. Drucker's manager is the trustee of civilization, a member of a 
Michael Polanyian-type priestly profession in which one works not so much for
one's principals as for the smooth, efficient operation of the system as a whole in a way that 
makes sense to and reconciles the interests of all stakeholders: freedom and community,
efficiency and equity, order and disruption are then reconciled through the judgments and values of 
this particular honorable professional castes of managers.

d€\public interest and public liberties as welld€\: Suppose I wanted to drop a footnote: a€™ If my 
editors would let me, here I would also trace the current of 20th-century thought
and action for which Michael Polanyi, born in 1891 in Budapest, is a convenient marker: how society 
needs not just the decentralized mercenary institution of the market and
definitely does not need comprehensive central planning (which can never be more than a fiction), 
but needs as well decentralized fiduciary institutions, focused on advancing
knowledge about theory and practice, in which status is gained by teaching and learning from 
othersa€”institutions like modern science, communities of engineering practice,
communities                                                                                 of 
legal interpretation, honorable journalism, evidence-based politics, and othersa€”and in which 
people follow rules that have been half-constructed and have half­
emerged to advance not just the private interest and liberties of the participants but to advance 
the broader public interest and public liberties as well. And at the end of that I would
drop a reference to where people should go to read further. What would the single best reference to 
drop be?

An answer from Nicholas Gruen:

Nicholas Gruen: a€~Ita€™ s a tricky question because Michael Polanyi was a chemist, then an 
economist and then a philosopher. His only important publications in economics
proper are are his first, which was the first to show how little the Soviet economic expansion was 
funding improved living standards, and Full Employment and Free Trade, which
outlines a neoliberal (i.e. minimally interventionist) Keynesianism with which some of the Mont PA' 
lerin Society were enamoured ofa€”like Gottfried Haberler who wrote a
preface  to its second edition. The issues youa€™re raising are probably best expressed in Michael 
Polanyia€™ s 1941 piece a€reThe Growth of Thought in

Societya€d, Economica, 8:32 (Nov. 1941) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2550108>.

a€~I think his attempt to distinguish public from private liberty was a fine idea first articulated 
in this piecea€’’though it never caught on. Ita€™ s another way to cut different
aspects of liberty as Berlina€™ s a€~positivea€™ and a€~negativea€™ is. The odd thing 
howevera€”ita€™ s certainly puzzled me, is that MP doesna€™ t really spend much
time                                                                             on the 
professions. His categories for the occupations that both nurture and require a€~public libertya€™ 
are those pursuing transcendent values: Science: Truth; The law:

Justice; Art: Beauty; Religion: God. I came upon Polanyi after Ia€™ d come to the kind of view you 
sketch out therea€”that led me to write this essaya€’’citing Alasdair MacIntyre
and the importance of the values of professions: 
<https://griffithreview.com/articles/trust-competition-delusion-gruen/>.

a€~But on this Michael Polanyi is largely silent. And then therea€™ s his marvellous rethinking of 
the philosophy of science around the centrality of tacit knowledge. Once he took
up                                                                                on that stuff he 
mostly neglected the concerns that you and are seem to be interested in!a€!a€™

<https://doi.org/10.1080/095054308027Q5889>: 'a€reMichael Polanyi spent his long career thinking 
and writing about the workings of science and the
scientific community. Moreover, he saw in the workings of that community the core principles and 
practices of the good political republic, as spelled out in his famous essay,
a€~The Republic of Sciencea€™. There is, however, a tension between his political theory and his 
epistemological contribution, in particular his path-breaking writings about the
tacit dimension in knowledge formationa€”or what he described as a€~nersonal knowledpea€™ . On the 
one hand, his nolitical essav snnnorts a classical conservative nosition.


while on the other, his theory of tacit knowledge anticipates much of the post-modern radical 
critique of long-standing Enlightenment assumptions about scientific objectivity and
the disinterested pursuit of knowledge. This otherwise contradictory position can be understood by 
following Polanyi's own epistemological prescription, namely by examining the
underlying assumptions that constitute his own tacit knowledge. Polanyi's personal history reveals 
the less-apparent assumptions tacitly underlying his republic of science. Polanyi's
own a€~fiduciary communitya€™ a€”in particular, his deep personal and intellectual ties to 
classical conservative theory, his association with Frederick von Hayek, and his
membership in the neo-liberal Mont Pelerin Societya€’’shaped his theoretical conceptualization of 
the so-called a€~republic of sciencea€™ . In this way, Polanyi's political
contribution diverges from his own epistemological requirements, in a way that largely obscures 
important intellectual roots required to properly interpret his political
thoughta€!a€D

I should also mention Karl Polanyia€™ s wife Ilona Duczynska, the youngest member of Lenina€™ s 
a€oeZimmerwald Circlea€D during World War I, and Karl and Michael
Polanyia€™ s sister Laura (a€ceMousiea€D): Judit Zapor: Laura Polanyi 1882-1957: Narratives of a 
Life: a€~ Although we have no way of confirming the actual steps she had
taken,    it seems that Laura Polanyi had been instrumental in her daughter [Eve]'s eventual 
release [from the Soviet GULAG]; no small feat, given the times and circumstances. As
an unintended by-product, Eva Striker's imprisonment served as the inspiration for her childhood 
friend, Arthur Koestler's novel, Darkness at Noon. The series of subsequent
dramatic events included Laura Polanyi's own arrest by the Gestapo in Vienna in the aftermath of 
the Anschluss, and ended with her eventual success in helping her three children,
her seventy-year-old husband, numerous nephews, nieces and friends to reach America. The one tragic 
failure concerned her younger sister, Sophie, who, with her husband and two
of their three children, perished in concentration campsaCI

And, on Ilona Duczynska: Kari Polanyi Levitt, Rosa Luxemburg Lecture: a€oeLet me begin with my 
mother, Ilona Duczynska: if I were a believer, I would know that my mother
was smiling down upon me here at the podium of the Rosa Luxembourg Foundation. My mother was a 
student of engineering in Zurich in 1915, when she was befriended by a
community of representatives of the Russian Social Democratic Party opposed to the war, including 
Lenin, his wife Krupskaya and Angelica Balabanoff. Together with delegations
from Germany, France, and Britain, as well as other European Labour and Socialist parties, they met 
to draft a program of action against the war, known as the Zimmerwald
Declaration.

a€oeAs an 18-year-old Hungarian-speaking student unknown to any informant, Ilona was entrusted with 
delivering this call to action to the leaders of the Social Democratic Party
in Vienna. When she presented herself to these gentlemen, they took one look at her and told her to 
go home, child, just go home. Having failed in this mission, she proceeded to
Budapest where she received a warmer welcome from Ervin Szabo - a leading anarchist and head of the 
public library. With his counsel and advice, she found other young people to
participate in a plan to distribute anti-war literature. She wrote the texts, found the printer and 
together with her comrade Tibor Sugar, they organized the distribution of leaflets in
the   great Weiss Manfred war factory and the army barracks.

a€oeEventually they were caught, imprisoned and charged with treason a€“ it was not a small matter. 
The trial of Duczynska, a beautiful young woman from a very good family,
and Tibor Sugar, who was briefly her partner in marriage before she met my father, aroused 
considerable public interest. They were liberated from prison by the 1918 revolution
which terminated the war and established the first Hungarian Republic. Ilona was a founding member 
of the Hungarian Communist party, at that time largely composed of young
people. With an excellent education and knowledge of several languages, she was called to Moscow to 
serve as translator to Karl Radek in the preparations for the historic Second
International Congress of Communist Parties. Ilona returned to Vienna in 1920, and subsequently was 
expelled from the party for a€ceLuxembourgist deviationsa€D and a
publication    in a journal edited by Paul Levi, who also fell into disfavor with the party. As a 
young woman in her early twenties, she must have admired Rosa Luxembourg, who was
a generation older, as a very important and senior figure in the movement.

a€ceMany years later, following the destruction of the Austrian working class movement in February 
1934, my mother rejoined the Communist Party in order to continue the
struggle of the now-illegal Schutzbund, the military arm of the Austrian Social Democratic Party, 
until 1936 when she joined my father and myself in London. Subsequently, she
was expelled from the Austrian Communist Party in London on orders from Moscow. No reasons were 
given.

a€oeMy mother was a very independent person and my father adored her. Karl and Ilona first met in 
1920, at the Helmstreits Muhle, a villa provided as a refuge for political exiles
from Hungary, by a Viennese well-wisher. My father left Budapest in 1919, and was soon joined by a 
larger exodus of communists, socialists, radicals and liberals following the
accession of the reactionary regime of Admiral Horthy. The comrades in the villa were of my 
motheraC™ s generation, and my father, who was 10 years older, would sit by himself,
quietly writing. In a letter he wrote much later in life about meeting my mother, he said that she 
was a revolutionary and her name was Polish, and that was close enough to his ideal
of  the Russian revolutionary young woman. Ilona recalled that he seemed like a person whose life 
was behind hima€!
