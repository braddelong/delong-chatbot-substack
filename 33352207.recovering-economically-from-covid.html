We get one-time sharp rises in wages in previously shutdown sectors, but it is a healthy and warranted jump in relative prices that does not feed through to inflation expectations—again, as after WWII. And we are very glad we did the $1.9T...</p><p></p><p>3) The multiplier from the $1.9% turns out to be significantly greater than Edelberg &amp; Sheiner project, and the Fed needs to raise 10-year rates by 2-3%-points in order to keep the U.S. economy from overheating significantly.

There are going to be supply- and value-chain management business school cases coming out of this for some time to come:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ryan Anderson</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Chips, Automotive, &amp; the Future</em>: ‘The industry hardest hit by the shortage right now is automobile manufacturing. Volkswagen, Nissan, GM, and Ford have all announced significant production cuts. Ford has projected as much as a 20% drop in production this quarter due to the shortage…. Nearly 70% of microcontroller units that end up in cars rely, at least in part, on semiconductors from a single Taiwanese company… Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)…. TSMC now manufactures chips for major tech companies like Nvidia, AMD, and even Apple’s new custom A14 (mobile) and M1 (laptop) chips. Chips from those 3 companies are incredibly valuable. A top-of-the-line Nvidia graphics card costs almost $2,000 and AMD CPUs can run over $600…. The automobile industry operates differently. The initial buyers of the semiconductors are companies like Renesas and NXP who design the microcontrollers a car relies on. Automobile manufacturers then buy the microcontrollers…. TSMC may end up charging $1 for a semiconductor that a $40,000 car relies on. As a manufacturer who has more demand than they can fill, TSMC is going to prioritize the high-value chips. Meaning these car parts, which only account for 3% of TSMC’s revenue, go to the back of the line.

Clearly, necessities. But conveniences and luxuries are, well, merely convenient and luxurious. I think the first key is noting that wealth has a purpose: to get things done. And I think the second key is to be mindful of what is going on around you, both in the human and in the physical world, with your conveniences and luxuries:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Wikipedia</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Hedonic Treadmill</em>: ‘Hedonic adaptation may be a more common phenomenon when dealing with positive events as opposed to negative ones…. Negative emotions often require more attention and are generally remembered better…. Adopting “non-zero sum” goals, those which enrich one’s relationships with others and with society as a whole (i.e. family-oriented and altruistic goals), increase the level of subjective well-being. Conversely, attaching importance to zero-sum life goals (career success, wealth, and social status) will have a small but nevertheless statistically significant negative impact on people’s overall subjective well-being….

Well, don’t say we didn’t warn you. Crack: At pixel, the entire EV space is collapsing…. The only question left is, when’s the bottom?

And in five years’ time they’re going to be everywhere. I’ve been saying for years that most people relate to computers and information technology as if they’re magic, and to get the machine to accomplish a task they have to perform the specific ritual they’ve memorized with no understanding. It’s an act of invocation, in other words. UI designers have helpfully added to the magic by, for example, adding stuff like bluetooth proximity pairing, so that two magical amulets may become mystically entangled and thereafter work together via the magical law of contagion. It’s all distressingly bronze age, but we haven’t come anywhere close to scraping the bottom of the barrel yet.
