The Obama administration had a plan for a first round of recovery measures. It had no plan for what it would do if Republicans and blue-dog Democrats proved obstreperous, and its first round failed to do the entire job. The cost was a lost half-decade of growth, and a further widening of income inequalities. The Biden administration was not going to make that mistake, but would, rather, prefer to make its own different mistakes.</p><div class="paywall-jump"></div><p>The second mistake was falling into the trap of giving too large boost to spending. Rapid and complete recovery would require the acceptance of some inflation: wages, needed to rise in expanding industries to pull workers into them, because the post-plague configuration of the economy would be different than the pre-plague configuration ; bottlenecks would emerge during reopening, and the prices of bottlenecked commodities needed to rise in order to signal the economy that here was a problem of finding substitutes and increasing supply that needed to be crowd, sourced and sold quickly. How much inflation? Nobody could say. But if the re-opening inflation shock was too large, it could easily trigger a Federal Reserve overreaction, which would put us once again back into the semi-depressed or depressed state of secular-stagnatio,n with interest rates at their zero lower, bound and little policy traction to promoe recovery.</p><p>The third mistake was that too big a boost to spending would be followed by an insufficient reaction by the Federal Reserve, in which case the economy would fall into a configuration in which inflationary expectations were elevated, which would lead to a stagflation reminiscent of the 1970s. </p><p>The metaphor of steering, like Odysseus, between Scylla and Charybdis seems apposite. The first mistake is simply not steering through the strait at all, the second is sailing too close to the hydra monster, Scylla, of seclar stagnation. The third is being dragged into the stagflation whirlpool of Charybdis.</p><p>Even a year ago, however, it still seemed that the task was not that difficult. There had been policy and political will to set the oars to work to drive the boat forward at speed. There seemed to be a wide middle path between secular stagnation and staglation. You could argue—we did—about whether staglation was the bigger danger to be avoided, or secular stagnation was. But both risks seemed relatively low, and manageable with a Federal Reserve that understood the situation, and was not prone to panic.</p><p>Then, this last February, came Vladimir Putin's invasion of the Ukraine. The safe path narrowed—indeed, the safe path may have disappeared. Then, in June, the Federal Reserve abandoned its forward guidance with a 75 basis-point interest-rate hike, pointing to an unreliable Michigan survey number as justification. It, at least, no longer believed that it understood the situation. </p><p>Thus today what worries me even more than that there might be no safe path is that whether or not there is, the Federal Reserve appears to have given up on trying to find it. I no longer hear Federal Reserve officials note that last winter and spring's tightening of monetary and financial conditions has not yet had a chance to materially affect the economy. Janet Yellen once said to me that the FOMC had a strong tendency to overreact to the immediate news flow unless it based its thinking around and had something like the Taylor Rule to serve as a navigational Pole Star. But the world has changed. The Great Moderation economy in which the Taylor Rule made sense is gone. And the Federal Reserve has no replacement to guide its thinking away from immediate news-driven groupthink.</p><p>Financial markets, at least, right now appear to be betting that the Federal Reserve is about to make mistake number two: pursuing policies that have too great a chance of returning us to the world of secular stagnation, once again at the zero interest rate lower bound on monetary policy, with the prospect of then triggering another lost half-decade of economic growth, and another upward leap in inequality.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/recovery-and-inflation-rowing-between/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/recovery-and-inflation-rowing-between/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div class="install-substack-app-embed"><img class="install-substack-app-embed-img" src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png"><div class="install-substack-app-embed-text"><div class="install-substack-app-header">Read Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality in the Substack app</div><div class="install-substack-app-text">Available for iOS and Android</div></div><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_context=author-post-insert" target="_blank" class="install-substack-app-embed-link"><button class="install-substack-app-embed-btn button primary">Get the app</button></a></div><p></p>
