Paragraphs:

Jamison Foser: a€™ Okay but trying to stop black people from voting is bad: Nate Cohn: a€oeThe 
Georgia election lawa€™ s restrictions on voting are unlikely to discernibly
affect turnout or the resulta€!a€D a€oeStructural racism is no big deal because black people can 
just work harder to overcome ita€D is not the novel or compelling argument the
New York Times seems to think it is. It is racist and tired. <https://t.co/pta4UaD7Ms>

Four Seasons Total Landscaping Mistermix: Not Everything Needs a a€~Well, Actuallya€™: a€~Not 
Everything Needs a a€~Pardon my commitment to a€cedataa€O and
a€cesciencea€D if I dona€™ t think that two studies of questionable applicability tell me much of 
anything about the effects of the Georgia law. This is, in general, my gripe about
data journalism: therea€™ s just not enough good data to draw evidence-based conclusions, so it 
devolves into speculative punditry with a patina of scientific respectabilitya€!.

Second, some things are beyond the need to do a sketchy a€oewell actuallya€D analysis piece, and a 
fundamental right like voting is a great example of one of those things.
a€oeWell, actually, we found two studies of people who had their little toes amputated and they 
walk just finea€D is not a justification for a program of toe amputation. Voting is a
right, full stop, and peoplea€™ s right to do it should not be unreasonably infringed. Six hour 
lines with no water is an unreasonable infringement. We dona€™ t need to go further
than that, and we certainly dona€™ t need a privileged white dude who grew up in a Seattle suburb 
and moved to DC after private college to push out a a€oewell, actuallya€D
piece about a Jim Crow revivala€!

Brie Wolfson: a€™How to get someone to help you: 1. determine the smallest unit of work required of 
the other person. 2. determine if there is some work you can do yourself
that would make [1] smaller. 3. Do that 4. Make a direct and concise aska€!. Formula for 4 is: a. a 
warm hello, b. brief context on why the thing is important (x told me to do it
doesna€™ t count), c. why you are asking them, and not someone else. d. the specific thing you 
would like them to contribute, e. when you need that help. Your colleagues want to

Anne Laurie: Late Night #PizzaGaetz Open Thread: Alexandra Petri Makes An Excellent Point. a€~ 
Alexandra Petri: a€oeRead the piece that within minutes inspired a man to
send me an email calling me a€oetootsa€D!!!!!!! a€UOpinion: This Should Not Happen More than Once: 
If sharing lewd photos happened twice, even, that is because a first time
went better than it should havea€!. There are several details of the Matt Gaetz story that keep 
sticking in my head, but the one that sticks in it most is the report that the Florida
Republican used to wander around and show his colleagues nude photos of people he had slept with. 
Therea€™ s a kind of grim weirdness to the idea of these interactions (which
Gaetz denies)a€”a very a€oel Read On eHow.com That Men Bond Over Conquestsa€D bewilderment. The 
callousness and the violation involved are enough of a sock to the gut.
But the fact that this was allegedly known about him is what keeps getting to me. The fact that 
this, or something in this neighborhood of bad, occasioned senior staff from then-
House Speaker Paul D. Ryana€™ s (R-Wis.) office to have a talk with Gaetz about professional 
behaviora€!. I keep coming back to the fact that it takes two to make a locker room.
To me, this is something you do, ideally, zero times. You never experience the impulse to do it, 
and you lead a pleasant life. You travel. You eat lunchmeat sandwiches. Maybe you
do a marathon, or climb something. You lead a blithe existence for many decades, you die in your 
bed in your mid-nineties surrounded by your cherished relatives, and in all that
time, you never walk up to a colleague on the floor of the House of Representatives and out of 
nowhere present him with a nude photograph of someone you claim to have had sex
with. But if you cana€™ t do it zero times, then ideally it happens only once. It happens only 
once, because the moment you do it, the person you show it to responds the way a
person should respond. You produce your photograph to your colleague, and your colleague looks at 
you and says, a€oeNever show that to anyone, ever again. Go home and rethink
your life. I do not feel closer to you. If anything, I want to have you removed forcibly from my 
presence by strong gentlemen whose biceps are tattooed with a€'M0M.a€™ The
fact that you thought this would make us closer makes me question every decision in my life that 
has led me to this point. Leave now and never come backa€da€l

Duncan Black: Theya€™ re Bad People, Brent. a€~Who is the audience for things like, a€oeGail 
Collins and Bret Stephens shoot the sa€”.a€D Not even picking on them,
specifically, though Bret is a disgusting clown even by the low standards of the conservative 
movement, but genuinely confused that in the year of our Gritty, 2021, therea€™ s still
a  market for this genre of thingsa€!. I think wea€™ re long past the era when a€cewea€D pretended 
that well-meaning people on Both Sides want basically the same things, they
just disagree about how to get there. It isna€™ t an argument about the glorious impact on the 
economy of low tax rates, or how Social Security Privatization will be BETTER for
your retirement. Ita€™ s about stealing all the money from poor people and giving it to rich 
people, or maybe not doing that. And thata€™ s before we get to the explicit bigotrya€!
