After that, we can suddenly make machines&nbsp;using lithography, which unleashes a second Gutenberg revolution in the economy. Physical goods like adding machines suddenly become information goods like Excel. And now all the old publishing world problems about products with zero marginal cost come back with a vengeance, along with all the more or less bad IP solutions for dealing with incentives for such products. And since the transistor is a product of Bell Labs, there are all the difficulties about how you fund innovation,&nbsp;maybe knowing that almost all the money will be wasted but not caring if it buys you one cool thing and how does&nbsp;one think about&nbsp;that? Presumably there would have been an independent inventor within a year or two, there was after all a large investment in solid-state physics research, but what if it had never happened at all?&nbsp;</p><p>Also there is a prehistory to the story: The previous analog to transistors (which, alas, could not be lithographed) was the vacuum tube, which directly descends from the light bulb and is first cousin to TV and particle accelerators. And it is also the basis of wartime computer designs which are immediately transistorized as soon as the opportunity presents. How narrow the basis for everything turns out to be! And then once we have the technology, it takes us seventy years to work out the products we can usefully make from it and to teach new generations enough to actually be receptive to the possibilities, and still no end in sight…&nbsp;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>6) Gordon Moore, "Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits”, <em>Electronics</em> Vol. 38 No. 8 (April 19, 1965) &lt;https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/ moores-law-electronics.pdf&gt;.</p><div><hr></div><p>7) Richard Baldwin, <em>The Great Convergence: Information Technology and the New Globalization</em>, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2016 &lt;https://books.google.com/?id=YXx3DQAAQBAJ&gt;.</p><div><hr></div><p>8) Dani Rodrik, <em>Has Globalization Gone Too Far?</em>, Washington: Institute for International Economics, 1997; David Autor, “Work of the Past, Work of the Future”, <em>American Economic Association Papers and Proceedings</em> Vol. 109 (2019), pp. 1–32 &lt;https://doi.org/ 10.1257pandp.20191110&gt;; J.
