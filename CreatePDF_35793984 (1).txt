Free speech advocates who care about the functioning of their community have never thought it 
appropriate for the free-speech principle to empower chaos monkeys who seek to
destroy their society and replace it with something with speech that would be less free:

John Milton: Areopagitica: a€~Yet if all cannot be of one minda€”as who looks they should 
be?a€”this doubtless is more wholesome, more prudent, and
more Christian, that many be tolerated, rather than all compelled. I mean not tolerated popery, and 
open superstition, which, as it extirpates all religions and
civil supremacies, so itself should be extirpate, provided first that all charitable and 
compassionate means be used to win and regain the weak and the
misled: that also which is impious or evil absolutely either against faith or manners no law can 
possibly permit, that intends not to unlaw itself: but those
neighbouring differences, or rather indifferences, are what I speak of, whether in some point of 
doctrine or of discipline, which, though they may be many,
yet   need not interrupt THE UNITY OF SPIRIT, if we could but find among us THE BOND OF PEACES!

Paragraphs:

John Anthers: Markets Give Powell a Break on Inflation. It May Be Transitory: S~The latest Federal 
Open Market Committee meeting still left us with a few more clues on how
the Fed intends to navigate through an exceptionally dangerous environments!. Virtually every data 
release for the last month has suggested a very strong recovery. The Fed wants
great improvement in unemployment, which is still running at a 6% rate, compared to 3.5% before the 
pandemicS!. So there are two questions. Do we see any signs of rising
prices caused by anything more than a transitory bottleneck? And, are inflation expectations 
showing signs of settling Soematerially above 2%SU? If there is any clear sign of a
possible bottleneck, it is inS! industrial metalsS!. Markets give us nice and precise measures of 
inflation expectations, via the breakevens between inflation-protected bonds, or
TIPS,  and conventional fixed-income Treasuries. The prediction this generates for average 
inflation over the next five years is just under 25%S!. Ten-year expectations are slightly
lowerS!. The best measure to justify continued lenience is the so-called 5-year, 5-year breakevens!

Patrick Wyman: Ancient South Asia: S~If we were to touch down in South Asia at the end of the 
Younger Dryas and the beginning of the Holocene around 12,000 years ago,
however, we wouldnS™ t have seen many people. Archaeological traces of a human presence are few and 
far between at the end of the Pleistocene. Much of the region wasnS™ t
particularly welcoming to people at that time; the Deccan Plateau, which makes up much of South 
Asia, would have been exceptionally arid. That is largely because the monsoon,
which brings torrential but life-giving rain every summer, was either much weaker or altogether 
absent. The rain-fed seasonal rivers that make much of South Asia welcoming to
people wouldnS™ t have flowed, leaving only the river valleys of the Indus and Ganges as 
particularly viable spots for people to live. As the Pleistocene gave way to the
Holocene,  the monsoon began to take on something more like its current form. As was the case 
elsewhere in the world at that time, the number of people living in South Asia
dramatically expanded with improving climatic conditions. Many of these new residents were the 
descendants of long-established hunter-gatherers. Some of them kept foraging;
others experimented with new ways of life. But others were new arrivals who set themselves up on 
the edges of the Indus Valley, bringing with them an agricultural package first
developed far to the west in the Fertile Crescenta€!

Joseph A. Francis: King Cotton, the Munificent Slavery & (Underdevelopment in the United States, 
1789a€“1865: S~Slaves were necessary for the countryS™ s cotton boom
because cotton was not sufficiently remunerative to attract yeoman farmers. Cotton exports then 
balanced the imports that the Federal Government taxed to obtain most of its
revenues. Those revenues were used to fund westward expansion, both directly through the 
acquisition and conquest of new territory, and indirectly through the policy of retiring
the national debt, which pumped liquidity into the countryS™ s nascent capital markets and 
bolstered the reputation of American bonds among foreign investors. State government
could then borrow to finance the transportation infrastructure that connected the new lands to 
markets, allowing them to be serried. Westward expansion tended to weaken
slaveholdersa€™ position in Congress because they were excluded from the rapidly growing Midwest. 
They therefore seceded. The North would not let the South leave the Union,
however, because secession threatened to take awav the Federal Governments™ s main source of 
revenues. As a result, the Civil War began, leading to emancination. Slaverv had


thus financed the development of the settler society that would eventually abolish it, while the 
slaves themselves became an underdeveloped nation within a nationa€!

Aswath Damodaran: Equity Risk Premiums (ERP): Determinants, Estimation, and Implicationsa€“The 2021 
Edition'. a€~The equity risk premium is the price of risk in equity
markets, and it is not just a key input in estimating costs of equity and capital in both corporate 
finance and valuation, but it is also a key metric in assessing the overall market.
Given   its importance, it is surprising how haphazard the estimation of equity risk premiums 
remains in practice. We begin this paper by looking at the economic determinants of
equity risk premiums, including investor risk aversion, information uncertainty and perceptions of 
macroeconomic risk. In the standard approach to estimating the equity risk
premium, historical returns are used, with the difference in annual returns on stocks versus bonds, 
over a long period, comprising the expected risk premium. We note the limitations
of  this approach, even in markets like the United States, which have long periods of historical 
data available, and its complete failure in emerging markets, where the historical data
tends to be limited and volatile. We look at two other approaches to estimating equity risk 
premiums a€“ the survey approach, where investors and managers are asked to assess the
risk premium and the implied approach, where a forward-looking estimate of the premium is estimated 
using either current equity prices or risk premiums in non-equity markets. In
the next section, we look at the relationship between the equity risk premium and risk premiums in 
the bond market (default spreads) and in real estate (cap rates) and how that
relationship can be mined to generate expected equity risk premiums. We close the paper by 
examining why different approaches yield different values for the equity risk premium,
and                                                                                 how to choose 
the a€oerighta€n number to use in analysisa€!

Gary Gorton: Recent Changes & the Future of the US Financial System: a€~The financial crisis has 
not been solved because financial crises are inherent in market economics. A
financial crisis is always about runs on short-term debt, e.g. in the repo market. The general 
trend in the past couple decades has been a decline in deposits replaced with other short­
term debt instruments like repo contractsa€!. Stablecoin is essentially unregulated free banking 
that issues deposits. However, free banking never worked in the past, even in cases
whether the government required backing. There needs to be credible backing for Stablecoin as they 
are now runnable without any entity overseeing thema€!. The fundamental
theorem  of bank regulation stipulates that bank regulators can only decide the location of the 
banking system. Without carrotsa€”or incentivesa€”to keep a bank, they can move, as
evidenced by the rise of mortgage and loan origination outside of the banking system given the high 
costs of staying a banka€!
