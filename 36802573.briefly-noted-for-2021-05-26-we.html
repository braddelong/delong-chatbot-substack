[When] I went on a multi-post tear into the NRO… what impressed me then was the lack of discernable political philosophy.

The audience starts to whisper and giggle to one another…” &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070610024139/https://www.iisec.ucb.edu.bo/amercado/clases/macroeconomia_maestria/lecturas/The_reincarnation_of_keynesian_economics.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20070610024139/https://www.iisec.ucb.edu.bo/amercado/clases/macroeconomia_maestria/lecturas/The_reincarnation_of_keynesian_economics.pdf</a>&gt;. </p><p>A curious thing is that this was written by Lucas a year and a half after what he characterized as “the beginning of the end for my attempts to account for the business cycle in terms of monetary shocks”. </p><p>I confess it is one thing to form a “sub-culture… more like… a platoon on the battlefield… [with] loyalty and group cohesion… priority, so models that were illogical or inconsistent with the evidence went unchallenged…” for an intellectual position you believe in. It is quite another for a position that you see as badly underwater and gambling for resurrection:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Paul Romer</strong>:&nbsp;<em>What Went Wrong in Macro—Historical Details</em>: ’ Solow was harshly critical of the new&nbsp;classical macro models pioneered by Robert Lucas, dismissive in a way that seemed to me to skirt uncomfortably close to contempt…&nbsp;concerned that the type of model Lucas was developing might undermine political support for active countercyclical policy. To his credit, there was a legitimate basis for this concern. The new&nbsp;Chicago school of macro eventually did oppose an active response to the financial crisis and its aftermath. But the type of response that Solow exemplified may actually have contributed to the emergence of this new Chicago school…. Tak[ing] seriously what the rebel group that was forming around Lucas was saying… might have kept the rebels from cutting off contact with all outsiders, even those who were taking seriously the issues they were raising. Once they cut off contact with the outside, these rebels developed a sub-culture that was more like what you’d expect to find among members of a platoon on the battlefield than among scientists parsing logic and weighing evidence. Loyalty and group cohesion took priority, so models that were illogical or inconsistent with the evidence went unchallenged. These values might have developed in any department, but they found support and encouragement at the University of Chicago, which was already committed to Stigler conviction instead of Feynman integrity… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://paulromer.net/what-went-wrong-in-macro-history/">https://paulromer.net/what-went-wrong-in-macro-history/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>This is really creepy;</p><blockquote><p><strong>McKinley Valentinie</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Polywater Fiasco</em>: ‘Strongest memories are points of disillusionment, because they’re turning points in how you view the world….
