About the Book

Jason Hickel!


For decades we have been told a story about the divide
between rich countries and poor countries.

We have been told that development is working: that the
global South is catching up to the North, that poverty has
been cut in half over the past thirty years, and will be
eradicated by 2030. It’s a comforting tale, and one that is

endorsed by the world’s most powerful governments and

Poor countries are poor because they are integrated into the

global economic system on unequal terms. Aid only works to
hide  the  deep  patterns  of  wealth  extraction  that  cause
poverty and inequality in the first place: rigged trade deals,
tax evasion, land grabs and the costs associated with climate
change. The Divide tracks the evolution of this system, from
the expeditions of Christopher Columbus in the 1490s to the
international debt regime, which has allowed a handful of
rich countries to effectively control economic policies in the
rest of the world.

billion live on less than $1 a day. The richest eight people now
control the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of the
world combined.

What is causing this growing divide? We are told that poverty
is a natural phenomenon that can be fixed with aid. But in
reality it is a political problem: poverty doesn’t just exist, it
has been created.

Karl Polanyi!

o

The first question is: The past hundred and fifty years or so has been
progressive, in a material well-being sense, for humanity to a degree that is
unprecedented, and would have struck all of our ancestors as astonishing. Why,
then,     are not people happier?

The answer I will give is that of the Austro-Hungarian-Jewish-American

sociologist Karl Polanyi: that people care most not about things but their rights,      
Introduction by R. M. Mc.clvor


and that the market-economic system that we have constructed offends what
people regard as their rights in several deep senses. But that offense can be
forgiven as long as material income growth is rapid enough and broad-based
enough—equitable enough—to distract.

Max Roser: a€oeMost people in the world live in poverty. 85% of the world live on less than $30 per 
day, two-thirds live on less than $10 per day, and every tenth person lives on less than $1.90 per 
day. In each of these statistics price differences between countries are taken into account to 
adjust for the purchasing power in each countrya€!a€D
