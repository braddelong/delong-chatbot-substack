Had inflation in fact matched that average since the beginning of the Great Recession, the core C.P.I. would now be 296 on a 1982-84=100 basis. It is actually 270.</p><p>If the Fed had hit its inflation target, the price level now would be 9.6 percent higher than it is. When the cumulative excess of C.P.I. core inflation over 2.5 percent per year reaches +9.6 percent, come and ask me again whether Federal Reserve policy is excessively inflationary. Until then, we certainly have other much more important economic problems to worry about than the risks of excessive and damaging inflation.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-04-15-th?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-04-15-th?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Lawless</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Seven Samurai: The Farmer’s Daughter and Female Agency</em>&lt;<a href="https://akirakurosawa.info/forums/topic/seven-samurai-the-farmers-daughter-and-female-agency/">https://akirakurosawa.info/forums/topic/seven-samurai-the-farmers-daughter-and-female-agency/</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Cosma Shalizi</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Review of Lyotard, The Postmodern Condition</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="http://bactra.org/reviews/lyotard-pmc.html">http://bactra.org/reviews/lyotard-pmc.html</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Martin Sandbu</strong>:&nbsp;<em>A New Washington Consensus Is Born</em>: ‘The conversion by the IMF and World Bank to support the activist state would put Saul of Tarsus to shame… &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d8d2270-1533-4c88-a6e3-cf14456b353b">https://www.ft.com/content/3d8d2270-1533-4c88-a6e3-cf14456b353b</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Chris Walker</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Kevin McCarthy Wrongly Claims He Never Voted Against Overturning Biden’s Win</em>: ‘“What I voted on wasn’t to overturn an election, because it wouldn’t.

And so a lot of the Communist Party’s main roles for the last few decades has been to provide inspiration to the organizations in which it leads. It really wants to inspire people about the transformative utopia, the communist future that the party wants to pursue. And then the other part is control…. A lot of this is about the Communist Party referring back to its roots as a revolutionary combat party that had a major struggle before it could consolidate power, and then its goal is to transform the country into a utopia. A lot of this is the Party’s means to try to really inspire people, and to keep working on these important goals…. It’s an incredibly paranoid organization.

Some are still being debated, to great frustration.&nbsp;Perhaps one the most striking examples of all this is what happened with what we learned, and refused to learn, from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February of 2020, a tragic natural experiment if there ever was one. Thousands of people were trapped inside a cruise ship as the disease spread. Besides the tragedy, it allowed us to observe what happened with the coronavirus inside a closed environment, revealing many things that could be harder to discern in a large, open city…. Jose-Luis Jimenez: “With time I realized that aerosol scientists, including myself, have been gaslit in an industrial scale over the last year….” It’s not a good moment when a prominent scientist—who was, along with others, evidence-based, correct and prescient on a topic of great importance within his expertise—feels the need to look up “gaslighting” because he is lacking the word to otherwise describe his experience…. As I close the misinformation trifecta series about problems beyond the ones that are “over there,” committed by others,&nbsp; I’d like us not to forget what actually happened in more mainstream and arguably more important circles, and is still influencing how we have been responding—and failing to respond—to this pandemic.… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/the-gaslighting-of-science">https://zeynep.substack.com/p/the-gaslighting-of-science</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Herbert A. Simon</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Organizations and Markets</em>: ‘A mythical visitor from Mars, not having been apprised of the centrality of markets and contracts, might find the new institutional economics rather astonishing…. A telescope that reveals social structures…. Firms reveal themselves, say, as solid green areas with faint interior contours marking out divisions and departments. Market transactions show as red lines connecting firms, forming a network in the spaces between them. Within firms (and perhaps even between them) the approaching visitor also sees pale blue lines, the lines of authority connecting bosses with various levels of workers. As our visitor looked more carefully at the scene beneath, it might see one of the green masses divide, as a firm divested itself of one of its divisions. Or it might see one green object gobble up another. At this distance, the departing golden parachutes would probably not be visible. No matter whether our visitor approached the United States or the Soviet Union, urban China or the European Community, the greater part of the space below it would be within the green areas, for almost all of the inhabitants would be employees, hence inside the firm boundaries. Organizations would be the dominant feature of the landscape. A message sent back home, describing the scene, would speak of “large green areas interconnected by red lines.” It would not likely speak of “a network of red lines connecting green spots”… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.5.2.25">https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.5.2.25</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Pete Saunders</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Covid–19 Pandemic Could Make U.S. Tech Hubs Richer</em>: ‘Cities with strong foundations in technology should recover quickly&nbsp;from the pandemic, while the Sun Belt could go the way of the Rust Belt… with advances in automation—some pioneered under the pressure of Covid–19 lockdowns—eliminating even more service-sector jobs….
