Paragraphs:

Charles Kindleberger: The World in Depression, 1929a€“1939: a€™ The explanation of this book is 
that the 1929 depression was so wide, so deep and so long because the international economic system 
was rendered
unstable by British inability and United States unwillingness to assume responsibility for 
stabilizing it in three particulars: (a) maintaining a relatively open market for distress goods; 
(b) providing counter-cyclical long-term
lending; and (c) discounting in crisis. The shocks to the system from the overproduction of certain 
primary products such as wheat; from the 1927 reduction of interest rates in the United States (if 
it was one); from the halt of
lending to Germany in 1928; or from the stock-market crash of 1929 were not so great. Shocks of 
similar magnitude had been handled in the stock-market break in the spring of 1920 and the 1927 
recession in the United
States. The world economic system was unstable unless some country stabilized it, as Britain had 
done in the nineteenth century and up to 1913. In 1929, the British couldna€™t and the United 
States wouldna€™ta€!

Matthew Boudway: Eric Hobsbawm, 1917 - 2012: a€~Hobsbawm described himself as a a€oeTory 
communista€na€!. Hobsbawma€! found much of the Sixties counterculture decadent and, at best, 
counterproductivea€!.
Hobsbawm also became an object lesson in the dangers of ideological devotion. His passion for 
justice drew him into a cause that would require him to excusea€! many injusticesa€!. A lot of 
Western Communists abandoned
ship  after the Soviet crackdown on Hungary in 1956. Not Hobsbawm. Nor did he quit after the tanks 
rolled into Praguea€!. He famously claimed that if the Soviet Union had succeeded in creating a 
true communist society, it
would have been worth the deaths of the twenty million people who perished under Stalina€!. 
Self-sacrifice wasna€™ t the only kind of sacrifice that socialism might requirea€!. He wasa€!, a 
man who had subordinated
everything to a single hope. He would admit that this hope had been disappointed, but he would not 
renounce it. To do so would have been to renounce himselfsa€!

William Faulkner: Intruder in the Dust: a€~Ita€™ s all now you see. Yesterday wona€™ t be over 
until tomorrow and tomorrow began ten thousand years ago. For every Southern boy fourteen years 
old, not once but
whenever he wants it, there is the instant when ita€™ s still not yet two oa€™ clock on that July 
afternoon in 1863, the brigades are in position behind the rail fence, the guns are laid and ready 
in the woods and the furled
flags    are already loosened to break out and Pickett himself with his long oiled ringlets and his 
hat in one hand probably and his sword in the other looking up the hill waiting for Longstreet to 
give the word and ita€™ s all in
the balance, it hasna€™ t happened yet, it hasna€™ t even begun yet, it not only hasna€™ t begun 
yet but there is still time for it not to begin against that position and those circumstances which 
made more men than Garnett
and Kemper and Armistead and Wilcox look grave yet ita€™ s going to begin, we all know that, we 
have come too far with too much at stake and that moment doesna€™ t need even a fourteen-year-old 
boy to think This
time. Maybe this time with all this much to lose than all this much to gain: Pennsylvania, 
Maryland, the world, the golden dome of Washington itself to crown with desperate and unbelievable 
victory the desperate gamble, the
cast made two years ago; or to anyone who ever sailed a skiff under a quilt sail, the moment in 
1492 when somebody thought This is it: the absolute edge of no return, to turn back now and make 
home or sail irrevocably on
and either find land or plunge over the worlda€™ s roaring rima€!

Nathan Andrew: Jing Huang, Factionalism in Chinese Communist Politics: a€~Huang offers a convincing 
new narrative of CCP political history from 1935 to about 1987, built around the idea of what he 
calls the Yana€™ an
Round Tablea€!. The lack of any civilian control over the military below the level of the 
functionally autonomous Central Military Commission sustained the need for a top leader to bridge 
the two domains of power, and the
top leadera€™ s authority in turn depended on maintaining this military-civilian gap. Anyone who 
tried to do a good job in some functional area (like the economy) by co-operating with other 
administrators, found himself
violating Maoa€™ s power interest in keeping the system fractionalised, and was therefore likely to 
be purged. Anyone whom Mao chose as a successor, and who therefore began to accumulate power across 
bureaucratic
systems or factions, threatened Maoa€™ s interests and had to be purgeda€!. Late in his life Mao 
was surrounded by leaders lacking deep roots in either the military or the Party bureaucracya€I

Scott Alexander: Book Review: How Asia Works: a€~ Studwella€™ s guide to good economic policya€!. 
1. Land Reforma€! taking farmland away from landlords and giving it to peasant farmersa€!. 2. 
Industrial Policy and
Financea€!. Financial hubsa€! good work if you can get ita€!. a€oeHigh-value agricultural 
producersa€Da€! Denmark and New Zealanda€!. They also dona€™t scalea€!. Third, manufacturing, eg 
everyone elsea€!. In
addition to domestic competition, these governments enforced a€oeexport disciplinea€D. In order to 
keep their government perks (and sometimes in order to keep existing at all), companies needed to 
sell a certain amount of
units abroada€!. Arena€™ t there good free-market arguments against tariffs and government 
intervention in the economy? The key counterargument is that developing country industries arena€™ 
t just about profit.

Theya€™ re about learninga€I. 3. Financea€! is really a corollary of the industrial policy section. 
Developing country financial systems need to support industrial policy by preferentially offering 
great loans to industrial
learning projectsa€!
