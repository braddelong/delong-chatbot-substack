CONDITION: More Wonders of Invisible Crypto-World

Terra-Luna goes from $30 billion of market capitalization to $100 million. Terra-USD goes from $18 
billion of market capitalization to $6 billion. But the only thing backing Terra-USD is your 
ability to turn it into Terra-Luna. And how can anyonea€™ s assessment of the value of that backing 
not scale with the market capitalization of Terra-Luna.
Whimper. Whimper. Whimper.

Optimal control. You have an objective: to get inflation back into its target range over the medium 
terma€”five to ten years from nowa€”and to do so while doing the least damage to other objectives 
like employment and growth. If your best forecast is that your current policy path gets you there, 
you maintain your currency policy path. If your best forecast is that your current policy path does 
not get you there, you take the cheapest and most effective step to
move the future needle. If the bond-market 5-year 5-year forward inflation breakeven is not the 
best forecast, what is the best forecast? Indeed, given that inflation is an expectational 
phenomenon in all our standard modelsa€’’inflation will be what it is expected to be plus 
policy-change and economic-shock termsa€”it is very hard to see how the bond-market 5-year 5-year 
forward inflation breakeven could not be the best forecast. And if our standard models are
not the best models, what are the best models?

Thus I look at this, and I think those who claim inflation is a€oeout of controla€D are doing their 
audiences and their selves no good servicea€!
Me over at Project Syndicate:

With commentators offering increasingly dismal warnings about the inflation situation in the United 
States, one might think that the US Federal Reserve has failed completely at its primary task. But 
the bond market is telling a different story, and there is no reason to think that it is driven by 
doves.

BERKELEY a€“ As of Friday, May 6, the bond market expected US consumer price inflation to average 
2.5% between five and ten years from now. That is the rate of inflation needed to equalize returns 
on inflation-indexed and non-indexed US Treasury securities. And given that CPI inflation has been 
running higher than the rate associated with the implicit price deflator for personal consumption 
expenditures, I count that 2.5% five-year, five-year-forward rate
as hitting the US Federal Reservea€™ s 2% price-deflator inflation target.

What, then, would it take to get the economy back to the Feda€™ s targeted inflation rate? Since 
the five-year breakeven rate at the close of May 6 was 3.22%, the implicit expectation is that 
inflation will run a cumulative total of 3.6 percentage points above the Feda€™ s target over the 
next five years. If it does not cause the economya€™ s inflation anchor to vanish, a deviation of 
that size would be an exceedingly small price to pay for the rapid recovery from
the pandemic-induced recession. If the recovery delivers the structural economic transformation 
that we need, the higher inflation that we have experienced will have been well worth it.

Accordingly, it seems to me that the Fed should be taking a victory lap. It has done precisely what 
it is supposed to do, by enabling Americaa€™ s sticky-price, sticky-wage, sticky-debt economy to 
return rapidly not just to full employment but to the right version of full employment a€“ the one 
that has workers working in sectors making products for which there is real, fundamental demand a€“ 
after a shock. And it has done so without disrupting confidence in
the monetary system and its stability.

SUBJECT: Is There Systemic Risk Lurking in Crypto?

The truly devastating mistake made in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis was the assumption 
that mortgage-backed securities and derivatives were not a source of systemic risk. People 
(including me) we're all looking at derivatives in the foreign exchange market, not in the mortgage 
market. I regulators making the same mistake with "crypto"?:

Cory Doctorow: Defi & Shadow Banking 2.0: Leverage, Rigidity & Bank Runs: a€~The shadow banking 
systema€™ s a€reinnovationsa€D produceda€!. I. Leveragea€! every routine transaction in the real 
economy could result in fortunes changing hands in the shadow banking world. II. Rigiditya€! 
automatic sell-offs or margin calls when certain things took place. In good times, these made the 
gambling seem safe. During a crisis,
these turned into suicide pacts. III. Bank-runs: When over-leveraged assets hit a bump, the 
leverage and the rigidity of the contracts meant to a€cede-riska€D it triggered cascading 
price-dropsa€! which drives otherwise sound institutions to collapse. The shadow-banking system 
created a whole menagerie of exotic a€ceproductsa€D that all shared one characteristic: they were 
complex. The complexity of these instruments made it hard
to know when you were taking a suckera€™ s bet. Worse, they made it hard for designers, analysts 
and executives to understand how all the pieces fit togethera€!. Even where Congress didna€™ t tie 
regulatorsa€™ hands, those regulators chose to sit on them, taking a wait-and-see approach to 
shadow bankinga€!.

Hilary Allena€! makes the case that defi, the a€ redistributed financea€D wing of Web3, is really 
a€reShadow Banking 2.0a€D <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract id=4038788>a€!. Smart 
contracts dona€™t just create instability by being too complex to understand and vulnerable to 
coding error sa€’’they a€™ re also fraud magnets. In the glory days of the Big Con, ropers for con 
artists would ride the railroads, looking
for marks and setting up the con. If the mark was a gambler, theya€™ d send a telegram ahead to 
their confederates calling for a stock swindle, where the gambler would be out of his depth. If the 
mark was a stock broker, theya€™ d call for a horse-racing scam, because brokers didna€™ t 
understand the ponies. The Venn intersection of a€repeople who codea€D and a€repeople who 
understand financea€O is so small ita€™ s a
sphincter. Scammers who work smart contracts dona€™ t even need to change up the swindle: no matter 
whether the mark is a coder or a banker, there will be key elements of the game they cana€™ t make 
heads nor tails ofa€!.

Allen notes that defi advocates will accuse her of focusing solely on defia€™ s risks and not on 
its benefits, notably, the decentralization that is the a€redea€D in a€redefi.a€D Allen counters by 
citing a paper from the Bank of International Settlements that critiques the a€redecentralisation 
illusiona€D <https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdfZr qt2112b.pdf>a€!. An untethered finance sector 
doesna€™t just harm the gamblers who enter its
casino: when the shadow banks collapse, they take the rest of us down with thema€!

Are we getting into the same kind of situation? There is now enough notional market value tied up 
in a€recryptoa€D that we could bea€”if anyone is being stupid enough to accept crypto assets as 
collateral on any large scalea€!


Paragraphs:

How much is this people being trained that they are powerful, and that their views are correct (or 
the reverse)? And how much is this something else? And is it determined by formal rankings, or by 
the informal social networks that spring up out of the process?:

Judith Delaney & Paul Devereux: Rank Effects in Education'. a€~Students who are highly ranked in 
their class or grade have better long-term outcomes, even after accounting for absolute levels of 
ability and performance^I. The impact of high-achieving peersa€!d the persistent gender gap in 
STEMa€!. The sizeable effects of (sometimes misleading) academic rank raise policy questions about 
whether and how students should be
informed of data that could influence their decisions about subject and career choicesa€!

Strongly concur. So much of what The FaceBook does appears in retrospect as simply a PR exercise. 
It is tremendously worrisome:

Casey Newton: How Facebook Undercut the Oversight Board'. a€~Todaya€™ s newsa€! represents a 
significant blow to the Oversight Boarda€™ s already fragile credibility a€” and arguably reduces 
its value to Facebook. The company spent several years and $130 million to create an independent 
body to advise it on policy matters. To ask that body for its advicea€! and then decide belatedly 
that such advice might be dangerous calls
into question the point of the entire enterprise. If the Oversight Boarda€™ s only role is to 
handle the easy questions, why bother with it at all?a€!

Time for everyone investing to take a deep breath, and remember the lessons of the past. The big 
lesson of the past is not to sell when you feel like it, and not to buy when you feel like it. For 
if you feel like it, probably lots of other people feel like it tooa€”and you do not want to pay 
the price-pressure penalty that selling or buying when all of them do will inflict on you:

Michael Batnick: Twenty Lessons Learned'. a€~l. Nothing lasts forever. When growth stocks were 
going up every day, it felt like it would never end. Now that growth stocks are going down, it

critical when it feels like youa€™ re getting
punished for managing risk. 4. Nothing is a perfect inflation hedge. Not gold, stocks, crypto, or

Diversification is the only answer to an unpredictable future. If everything is working, youa€™re
