There are only four known descriptions of Sarah Sally' Hemings.

Enslaved blacksmith Isaac Jefferson remembered that she was " mighty near white     very handsome, 
long straight hair down her back. " Jefferson
biographer Henry S. Randall recalled Jefferson "s grandson Thomas Jefferson Randolph describing her 
as ' light colored and decidedly good looking."

Mark Silk: Did John Adams Out Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings?'. a€~The first eight months of 
1802 were mercifully dull for President Jefferson. France and England signed a peace treaty, 
reopening European and Caribbean ports to American commerce. The Navy was making headway against 
Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean. West Point was established. A prime concern was paying off 
the national debt. The bitter election of 1800 was fading from
memory.

Then, in the September 1 issue of the Richmond Recorder, James Callender, a notorious journalist, 
reported that the president of the United States had a black slave mistress who had borne him a 
number of children. a€oeIT is well known that the man, whom it delighteth the people to honor, 
keeps, and for many years past has kept, as his concubine, one of his own slaves,a€D the story 
began. a€oeHer name is SALLY.a€D
Federalist newspapers from Maine to Georgia reprinted the story. Racist poems were published about 
the president and a€oeDusky Sally.a€D Jeffersona€™ s defenders were more muted, waiting in vain for 
the denial that never came from the Executive Mansion. The scandal rocked the fledgling nation.

How a€oewell knowna€D was the relationship between Jefferson and Hemings? Callender wrote that it 
had a€oeonce or twice been hinted ata€D in newspapers, as indeed it was in 1800 and 1801. And in 
reaction to his muckraking, the Gazette of the United States said it had a€oeheard the same subject 
freely spoken of in Virginia, and by Virginia Gentlemen.a€C But while scholars have combed the 
sources, they have identified no specific written reference to


the Jefferson-Hemings liaison prior to the appearance of Callendera€™ s scandalous report.

I believe I have found two such references. They precede the exposA© by more than eight years, and 
they come from the pen of none other than Jeffersona€™ s old friend and political rival John Adams. 
In letters to his sons Charles and John Quincy in January of 1794, Adams points to the relationship 
between the sage of Monticello and the beautiful young woman known around the plantation as 
a€oeDashing Sally.a€D The references have escaped notice until
now because Adams used a classical allusion whose significance historians and biographers have 
failed to appreciate.

Adamsa€™ letters offer tangible evidence that at least one of the countrya€™ s leading political 
families was aware of the Jefferson-Hemings relationship long before the scandal broke. The 
documents cast new light on the question of elite awareness of the relationship, on the nature of 
the press in the early republic, and on Adams himself.

Jefferson resigned as George Washingtona€™ s secretary of state on the last day of 1793. It had not 
been a good year. His efforts to force his hated rival Alexander Hamilton out of the cabinet for 
financial misconduct failed miserably. Continuing to support the French Revolution despite the 
guillotining of the king and queen and the blossoming of the Terror, he alienated Adams and was 
disappointed by WashingtonaC™ s proclamation of American neutrality in
Francea€™ s latest war with England. At 50 years old, he was eager to return to his beloved 
Virginia estate to live as a gentleman farmer and philosopher.

Adams, the vice president, refused to believe that his estranged friend was really done with public 
life. In letters to his two eldest sons, he sourly assessed the man he was convinced would 
challenge him to succeed Washington as president. On January 2 he wrote to Charles:

Mr Jefferson is going to Montecello to Spend his Days in Retirement, in Rural Amusements and 
Philosophical Meditationsa€’’Untill the President dies or resigns, when I suppose he is to be 
invited from his Conversations with Egeria in the Groves, to take the Reins of the State, and 
conduct it forty Years in Piety and PeaceaCI
On January 3 he wrote to John Quincy at greater length, enumerating seven possible motives for 
Jeffersona€™ s resignation.

(5) Ambition is the Subtlest Beast of the Intellectual and Moral Field. It is wonderfully adroit in 
concealing itself from its owner, I had almost said from itself. Jefferson thinks he shall by this 
step get a Reputation of an humble, modest, meek Man, wholly without ambition or Vanity. He may 
even have deceived himself into this Belief. But if a Prospect opens, The World will see and he 
will feel, that he is as ambitious as Oliver Cromwell
though no soldier. (6) At other Moments he may meditate the gratification of his Ambition; Numa was 
called from the Forrests to be King of Rome. And if Jefferson, after the Death or Resignation of 
the President should be summoned from the familiar Society of Egeria, to govern the Country forty 
Years in Peace and Piety, So be ita€!

In the vernacular of the time, a€ceconversationa€D was a synonym for sexual intercourse and 
a€cefamiliara€D was a synonym for a€oeintimate.a€n The obvious candidate for the person whose 
conversation and familiar society Jefferson would supposedly be enjoying at his bucolic home is 
Sally Hemings.
But who was Egeria, and how confident can we be that Adams intended Hemings when he invoked her 
name?

Egeria is a figure of some importance in the mythical early history of ancient Rome. According to 
Livy and Plutarch, after the death of the warlike Romulus, the senators invited a pious and 
intellectual Sabine named Numa Pompilius to become their king. Accepting the job with some 
reluctance, Numa set about establishing laws and a state religion.

To persuade his unruly subjects that he had supernatural warrant for his innovations, Numa claimed 
that he was under the tutelage of Egeria, a divine nymph or goddess whom he would meet in a sacred 
grove. The stories say she was not just his instructor but also his spouse, his Sabine wife having 
died some years before. a€oeEgeria is believed to have slept with Numa the just,a€D Ovid wrote in 
his Amores.

Age 40 when he became king, Numa reigned for 43 yearsa€”a golden age of peace for Rome during 
which, in Livya€™ s words, a€oethe neighboring peoples also, who had hitherto considered that it 
was no city but a bivouac that had been set up in their midst, as a menace to the general peace, 
came to feel such reverence for them, that they thought it sacrilege to injure a nation so wholly 
bent upon the worship of the gods.a€D

Adams, who was well versed in Latin and Greek literature, had every reason to feel pleased with his 
comparison. Like Rome at the end of Romulusa€™ reign, the United States was a new nation getting 
ready for its second leader. Jefferson would be the American Numa, a philosophical successor to the 
military man who had won his countrya€™ s independence. Like Numa, Jefferson was a widower (his 
wife, Martha, died in 1782) who would prepare himself
for the job by consorting with a nymph, his second wife, in a grove that was sacred to him.

I asked Annette Gordon-Reed, the Harvard scholar and author of _Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: 
An American Controversy-, what she made of the Adams references. a€oeWhile the two letters to his 
sons do not definitively prove that Adams knew about the Jefferson-Hemings liaison in early 
1794,a€D Gordon-Reed said in an email, a€oethis elucidation of the allusion to Egeria makes that an 
intriguing possibility.a€D

One didna€™ t require a classical education to grasp the Egeria allusion in the early 1790s. In 
1786, the French writer Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian had published _Numa Pompilius, Second Roi de 
Rome_, a romantic novel dedicated to Marie Antoinettea€”she liked ita€”and intended as a guide for 
an enlightened monarchy in France. (a€oePeople will believe Ia€™ ve written the story I Of you, of 
Louis, and of the French,a€D Floriana€™ s dedicatory poem
declares.) Soon translated into English, Spanish and German, the novel became a runaway best seller 
in the North Atlantic world.

It was while researching a novel of my own about the life and afterlife of Numa and Egeria that I 
happened upon the allusions in the two Adams letters. As a student of religion in public life, I 
have long been interested in Numa as an exemplary figure in the history of Western political 
thought from Cicero and St. Augustine to Machiavelli and Rousseau.

In fact, John Adams had made a point of invoking Numa and his divine consort in the three-volume 
_Defence of the Constitutions of Government- of the United States of America, which he published 
while serving as minister to England in 1787. a€oelt was the general opinion of ancient nations, 
that the divinity alone was adequate to the important office of giving laws to men,a€D he writes in 
the preface. a€oeAmong the Romans, Numa was indebted for those
laws which procured the prosperity of his country to his conversations with Egeria.a€D Later in the 
work he explains, a€oeNuma was chosen, a man of peace, piety, and humanity, who had address enough 
to make the nobles and people believe that he was married to the goddess Egeria, and received from 
his celestial consort all his laws and measuresa€la€D

In the _Defence_, Adams was at pains to inform the world that, unlike other nations past and 
present, the recently united American states a€oehave exhibited, perhaps, the first example of 
governments erected on the simple principles of nature.a€D In other words, no Egerias need apply: 
a€oelt will never be pretended that any persons employed in that service had any interviews with 
the gods, or were in any degree under the inspiration of heaven, any more than
those at work upon ships or houses, or labouring in merchandize or agriculture: it will for ever be 
acknowledged that these governments were contrived merely by the use of reason and the senses.a€D

Jefferson was the American avatar of Enlightenment rationality, a staunch opponent of the 
government establishment of religion, and the Washington administration^™ s foremost advocate of 
war with the Barbary pirates. Adamsa€™ portrayal of him consulting with a goddess in order to 
govern a€oein Piety and Peacea€D was sharply pointed on all counts. But did he intend the goddess 
in question to refer to Sally Hemings?

Therea€™ s good reason to think so. Seven years earlier, Jefferson had arranged for his 8-year-old 
daughter, Mary, to join him and his elder daughter, Martha, in Paris. Hemings, a slave who was also 
a half-sister of Jeffersona€™ s late wife, accompanied Mary on the trans-Atlantic passage to 
England; upon their arrival, the two girls went to stay with the Adamses in London. Hemings was 
then 14 years old but, tellingly, Abigail Adams thought she was 15 or 16.

Writing Jefferson that the two had arrived, Abigail Adams took them under her wing until an 
emissary showed up two weeks later to convey them to Paris, where Jefferson almost certainly began 
having sex with Hemings. So in 1787 John Adams had seen for himself that Jefferson had a nubile 
beauty in his possession. By the end of 1793, John Quincy and Charles presumably would have been 
aware of it, too. Otherwise, the sexual allusion to Egeria would have
been lost on them.

Significantly, John Adams did not allude to the matter when he wrote to Abigail at around the same 
time. She and Jefferson had something of a mutual admiration society, after all. a€oeMy Love to 
Thomas,a€D she wrote her husband on the very day that Jefferson resigned as secretary of state 
(though she wasna€™ t yet aware of that). Despite the two mena€™ s political rivalry, she 
maintained a high regard for Jefferson through the 1790s, describing him as a
man of a€ceprobitya€D in a letter to her sister. So while John Adams, in Philadelphia, did not 
refrain from criticizing Jefferson in his January 6,1794, letter to Abigail, in Massachusetts, he 
did so with care.

Jefferson went off Yesterday, and a good riddance of bad ware. I hope his Temper will be more cool 
and his Principles more reasonable in Retirement than they have been in office. I am almost tempted 
to wish he may be chosen Vice President at the next Election for there if he could do no good, he 
could do no harm. He has Talents I know, and Integrity I believe: but his mind is now poisoned with 
Passion Prejudice and Faction.

There was no mention of Numa and Egeria. As I see it, John knew that his wife would not be amused 
by the insinuation that Jefferson was retiring to an intimate relationship with the maidservant she 
had cared for in London seven years earlier. That joke was reserved for the boys.

A political eon passed between the vice presidents™ s private joke and the presidential scandal. In 
1796, Jefferson was narrowly defeated for the presidency by Adams and, under Article II of the 
Constitution (changed in 1804), indeed became vice president, having received the second-largest 
number of electoral votes. Four years later, he returned the favor, besting Adams in perhaps the 
ugliest presidential election in American history.

By then, Callender had won his muckraking spurs by publishing the story of Alexander Hamiltona€™ s 
affair with a married woman and subsequent illicit financial arrangement with the womana€™ s 
husband. Jefferson was sufficiently impressed to provide the journalist with financial support to 
keep up his anti-Federalist work. But in May of 1800, Callender was convicted and sentenced to nine 
months in prison under the Sedition Act for a€oeThe Prospect
Before Us,a€D a tract alleging pervasive corruption in the Adams administration. After his release, 
he approached Jefferson and asked to be appointed postmaster of Richmond. Jefferson refused. 
Callender traveled to Charlottesville and ferreted out the Hemings story, published under the 
headline a€oeThe President, Again.a€D

One of the more scurrilous commentaries on the story came from John Quincy Adams. On October 5, he 
sent his youngest brother, Thomas Boylston, a letter with an imitation of Horacea€™ s famous ode to 
a friend who had fallen in love with his servant girl that begins: a€oeDear Thomas, deem it no 
disgrace I With slaves to mend thy breed / Nor let the wencha€™ s smutty face I Deter thee from the 
deed.a€D

In his letter John Quincy writes that he had been going through books of Horace to track down the 
context of a quotation when what should drop out but this poem by, of all people, Jeffersona€™ s 
ideological comrade in arms Tom Paine, then living in France. John Quincy professed bafflement that 
a€cethe tender tale of Sallya€D could have traveled across the Atlantic, and the poem back again, 
within just a few weeks. a€oeBut indeed,a€D he wrote, a€oePain
being so much in the philosophera€™ s confidence may have been acquainted with the facts earlier 
than the American public in general .a€D

Historians have assumed that John Quincy, an amateur poet, composed the imitation ode in the weeks 
after Callendera€™ s revelation hit the press. But in light of his fathera€™ s letters, it is not 
impossible that he had written it before, as his arch little story of its discovery implied. Thomas 
Boylston arranged to have his brothera€™ s poem published in the prominent Federalist magazine The 
Port-Folio, where it did in fact appear under Painea€™ s name.
The Adamses never dismissed Callendera€™ s story as untrue. No direct comment from Abigail Adams 
has come to light, but Gordon-Reed argues in The Hemingses of Monticello that the scandal deepened 
her estrangement from Jefferson after the bitter 1800 election. When Mary Jefferson died in 1804, 
Abigail wrote Thomas a chilly condolence letter in which she described herself as one a€oewho once 
took pleasure in subscribing herself your friend.a€D
John Adams, in an 1810 letter to Joseph Ward, refers to James Callender in such a way as to imply 
that he did not consider the Hemings story credible. a€oeMr Jeffersons a€~Charitiesa€™ as he calls 
them to Callender, are a blot in his Escutchion,a€D he writes. a€oeBut I believe nothing that 
Callender Said, any more than if it had been Said by an infernal Spirit.a€D In the next paragraph, 
however, he appears more than prepared to suspend any such disbelief.

Callender and Sally will be remembered as long as Jefferson as Blotts in his Character. The story 
of the latter, is a natural and almost unavoidable Consequence of that foul contagion (pox) in the 
human Character Negro Slavery. In the West Indies and the Southern States it has the Same Effect. A 
great Lady has Said She did not believe there was a Planter in Virginia who could not reckon among 
his Slaves a Number of his Children. But
is it Sound Policy will it promote Morality, to keep up the Cry of such disgracefull Stories, now 
the Man is voluntarily retired from the World. The more the Subject is canvassed will not the 
horror of the Infamy be diminished? and this black Licentiousness be encouraged?a€!

Adams goes on to ask whether it will serve the public good to bring up the old story of 
Jeffersona€™ s attempted seduction of a frienda€™ s wife at the age of 25, a€oewhich is 
acknowledged to have happened.a€D His concern is not with the truth of such stories but with the 
desirability of continuing to harp on them (now that there is no political utility in doing so). He 
does not reject the idea that Jefferson behaved like other Virginia planters.

Adamsa€™ sly joke in his 1794 letters shows him as less of a prude than is often thought. It also 
supports Callendera€™ s assertion that the Jefferson-Hemings relationship was a€oewell known,a€D 
but kept under wraps. It may be time to moderate the received view that journalism in the early 
republic was no-holds-barred. In reality, reporters did not rush into print with scandalous 
accusations of sexual misconduct by public figures. Compared with
todaya€™ s partisan websites and social media, they were restrained. It took a James Callender to 
get the ball rolling.

John Adamsa€™ reference to Jeffersona€™ s Egeria put him on the cusp of recognizing a new role for 
women in Western society. Thanks largely to Floriana€™ s 1786 best seller, the female mentor of a 
politician, writer or artist came to be called his Egeria. That was the case with Napoleon, 
Beethoven, Mark Twain, Andrew Johnson and William Butler Yeats, to name a few. In Abigail, Adams 
had his owna€”though so far as I know she was never referred to
as such. It was a halfway house on the road to womena€™ s equality, an authoritative position for 
those whose social status was still subordinate.

Gordon-Reed has criticized biographers who insist that it is a€oeridiculous even to consider the 
notion that Thomas Jefferson could ever have been under the positive influence of an insignificant 
black slave woman.a€D Ironically, AdamsaC™ sarcastic allusion conjures up the possibility. Did 
Sally Hemings, JeffersonaC™ s French-speaking bedmate and well-organized keeper of his private 
chambers, also serve as his guide and counselora€”his Egeria? The
question is, from the evidence we have, unanswerable.

In the last book of his Metamorphoses, Ovid portrays Egeria as so inconsolable after the death of 
Numa that the goddess Diana turns her into a spring of running water. When Jefferson died in 1826, 
he and Hemings, like Numa and Egeria, had to all intents and purposes been married for four 
decades. Not long afterward, his daughter Martha freed Hemings from slavery, as her children had 
been freed before her.
We do not know if, as she celebrated her liberation, she also mourned her loss. But we can be 
confident that her name, like Egeriaa€™ s, will forever be linked with her eminent spouse, as John 
Adams predicted.

Jeffersona€™ s attempted seduction of a frienda€™ s wife at the age of 25, a€oewhich is 
acknowledged to have happened.a€D His concern is not with the truth of such stories but with the 
desirability of continuing to harp on them (now that there is no political utility in doing so). He 
does not reject the idea that Jefferson behaved like other Virginia planters.

Adamsa€™ sly joke in his 1794 letters shows him as less of a prude than is often thought. It also 
supports Callendera€™ s assertion that the Jefferson-Hemings relationship was a€oewell known,a€D 
but kept under wraps. It may be time to moderate the received view that journalism in the early 
republic was no-holds-barred. In reality, reporters did not rush into print with scandalous 
accusations of sexual misconduct by public figures. Compared with
todaya€™ s partisan websites and social media, they were restrained. It took a James Callender to 
get the ball rolling.

John Adamsa€™ reference to Jeffersona€™ s Egeria put him on the cusp of recognizing a new role for 
women in Western society. Thanks largely to Floriana€™ s 1786 best seller, the female mentor of a 
politician, writer or artist came to be called his Egeria. That was the case with Napoleon, 
Beethoven, Mark Twain, Andrew Johnson and William Butler Yeats, to name a few. In Abigail, Adams 
had his owna€”though so far as I know she was never referred to
as such. It was a halfway house on the road to womena€™ s equality, an authoritative position for 
those whose social status was still subordinate.

Gordon-Reed has criticized biographers who insist that it is a€oeridiculous even to consider the 
notion that Thomas Jefferson could ever have been under the positive influence of an insignificant 
black slave woman.a€D Ironically, AdamsaC™ sarcastic allusion conjures up the possibility. Did 
Sally Hemings, JeffersonaC™ s French-speaking bedmate and well-organized keeper of his private 
chambers, also serve as his guide and counselora€”his Egeria? The
question is, from the evidence we have, unanswerable.

In the last book of his Metamorphoses, Ovid portrays Egeria as so inconsolable after the death of 
Numa that the goddess Diana turns her into a spring of running water. When Jefferson died in 1826, 
he and Hemings, like Numa and Egeria, had to all intents and purposes been married for four 
decades. Not long afterward, his daughter Martha freed Hemings from slavery, as her children had 
been freed before her.
We do not know if, as she celebrated her liberation, she also mourned her loss. But we can be 
confident that her name, like Egeriaa€™ s, will forever be linked with her eminent spouse, as John 
Adams predicted.
