watch.</p><p><strong>Thrasymakhos</strong>: How so?</p><p><strong>Nikeratos</strong>: On the one hand, the grifters say: Trump deserves 100% credit for warp speed, and Biden and the press are showing how despicable they are by not praising him every day. And the grifted buy it.</p><p><strong>Polemarkhos</strong>: And on the other hand, actually getting a vaccine and so not being willing to fight the virus with your bare hands alone—that demonstrates that you are some kind of a… near-eunuch… what is the word they use?</p><p><strong>Adeimantos</strong>: But if it is unmanly to take the vaccine, isn’t it even more unmanly to spend lots of money developing the vaccine? Doesn't that show that you are greatly afeared and not a manly man?</p><p><strong>Thrasymakhos</strong>: It is not a coherent world view.&nbsp; The point is: different messages for different people. And modern media allows for segmentation of message.&nbsp;It doesn’t have to be coherent. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adeimantos</strong>: I do not understand.</p><p><strong>Aspasia</strong>: Suppose you are a wealthy and well-educated person who wants taxes low, and is looking for a reason that “Trump wasn’t so bad”.</p><p><strong>Kephalos</strong>: Well, he wasn’t so bad: he decided to do Operation “Warp Speed” after all…</p><p><strong>Aspasia</strong>: …then you get pitched the “warp speed” story. Exactly.</p><p><strong>Alkibides</strong>: But suppose you are someone doing less well. Suppose that your superior patriarchal gender status as a danger-seeking manly man is your primary identity. Then you defend that identity by demonstrating your fearlessness—by rejecting masks and vaccines.</p><p><strong>Polymarkhos</strong>: But Akhilleus demonstrated his manliness by fighting another human with a spear, and trained long and hard…</p><p><strong>Aspasia</strong>: …not by refusing to allow his immune system to train up for the contest of fighting microscopic semi-alive particles.</p><p><strong>Thrasymakos</strong>: You are thinking of the Americans as if they were a group of rational Greeks, capable of consistency, coherence, and analytic thought leading to agreement. You are forgetting the segmentation of the Republican base. If you care about keeping taxes low and staying alive; then you probably do not care that much about what happens to the “manly men” with COVID—the key is that Trump and his team worked hard to keep you rich and safe. You feel a little bit sad about the unnecessary deaths, but they could have taken personal responsibility and gotten vaccinated.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Alkibides</strong>: And if you can’t figure out a reason to say “Trump wasn’t so bad for me”, you need to face the unpleasant fact that Trump grifted you to. And that people are unwilling to do. </p><p><strong>Thrasymakos</strong>: And if you are willing to sacrifice your health to signal your fearlessness and thus your right to manly male gender dominance—well, whether Trump was also working for rich people to help them keep more of their money is not such a big deal to you.&nbsp; The big deal is that Trump models fearlessness, and is willing to say what he thinks—while, in their view, the Democratic men are all p-----whipped, too scared of being scolded by Alexandra Octavio-Cortez to speak up…</p><p><strong>Aspasia:</strong> And it’s not just white blue-collar southern and semi-rural men—the <em>New York Times</em> continues to pay Maureen Dowd, and her “Democratic men are unnatural because they are too empathic, and Democratic women are too unnatural because they are too assertive” has long been a great crowd-pleaser, at least with her bosses and the owners…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-06-28-mo?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-06-28-mo?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Atlantic Council Front Page</strong>:&nbsp;<em>A Special Event with Director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese </em>&lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H92ivdaGy8I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H92ivdaGy8I</a>&gt;:</p><div id="youtube2-H92ivdaGy8I" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;H92ivdaGy8I&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H92ivdaGy8I?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Adrian Goldsworthy</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Augustus: First Emperor of Rome</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3t8hBAAAQBAJ">https://books.google.com/books?id=3t8hBAAAQBAJ</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Wikipedia</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Behistun Inscription</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Augustus</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Deeds Done by the Divine Augustus</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Books/Ancient%20history/Augustus%20-%20First%20emperor%20of%20Rome%20-%20Adrian%20Goldsworthy.pdf">https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Books/Ancient%20history/Augustus%20-%20First%20emperor%20of%20Rome%20-%20Adrian%20Goldsworthy.pdf</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Federation of American Scientists</strong>:&nbsp;<em>8341 Unit :: Central Security Regiment :: PLA </em>&lt;<a href="https://fas.org/irp/world/china/pla/8341.htm">https://fas.org/irp/world/china/pla/8341.htm</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Wikipedia</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Han Zheng</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Zheng#First_Vice-Premier">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Zheng#First_Vice-Premier</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Michael Spence</strong>:&nbsp;<em>How Great Powers Should Compete</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-us-g7-zero-sum-competition-not-constructive-by-michael-spence-2021-06">https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-us-g7-zero-sum-competition-not-constructive-by-michael-spence-2021-06</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Scott Duncan</strong>:&nbsp;<em>’Glowing white hot over +40°C (104°F)</em>&nbsp;widely all along the western side of North America.… &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/ScottDuncanWX/status/1408443318749564935">https://twitter.com/ScottDuncanWX/status/1408443318749564935</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Greg Sargent</strong>: _’People are missing… Biden gained in heavily blue-collar Middle Suburbs.

But Manchin seems clear. We have our mini-bill deal. Let’s take the win and move on. Of course we’re also going to do soft infrastructure through reconciliation….

The hidden forces pulling us toward degeneracy can be found not only within our perennially embattled public schools but also in the major corporations that loud voices on the right now denigrate as “woke capital” and the military, as well. The screeching about voter fraud and immigration is a cousin to all this—Republicans have come to believe that basic demographic shifts justify a structural assault on voting rights, obviating the need for political argument and persuasion…. The only force that might eventually transform those institutions is the transformation of the American electorate—a long project of ideological conversion that might gradually encourage voters to demand not the protection but the establishment of a system that we might reasonably call American democracy.

The post-pandemic world will provide the impetus and tools to rethink the Corporation, and more broadly innovation, and how work is structured and how individuals contribute…. Making things, extracting things, and moving them around the world remains remarkably difficult in its own right, but all of those businesses are now constrained and enhanced by software as a primary source of innovation and operation. Every business is now a software business…. The biggest change has been the move of technology from a supporting role to a central role. It isn’t just that messaging became more important or that video meetings began to work, but that people quickly realized these can actually be superior. The next step is to take these tactical lessons and apply them more broadly…. Those that believe things will return to normal except maybe for that one thing, or that we’ll do what we always did just with this one extra step, will be the ones that are ultimately disrupted…. We’re emerging from a generation-defining event and there’s every reason to think in the years to come that the reinvention of work and what it means to be a corporation will change as much going forward as those did in the period following the return from the War…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/creating-the-future-of-work-449c66707e35">https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/creating-the-future-of-work-449c66707e35</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Matthew Yglesias</strong>:&nbsp;<em>“Future“ &amp; the Future of Media</em>: ‘The Paperclip Maximizer….
