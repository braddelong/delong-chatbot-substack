We should not say Scemy newsletter, which is on SubStackSd; we should say Scemy weblog, which is at 
the moment on substackSU:

Dan Hon: The One Where I Dona€™ t Want To Talk About Substack Just As Much As You Do, & Yet: S~We 
should not say a€cel have a SubstackSD but instead Scemy newsletter, which is on SubstackSU, 
because we should not give power to brands in this way. Are
we going to see a variant of yeah, I was into {band} before they were cool as a yeah, I used {tech 
platform} before they became synonymous with right-wing cancelled people Actually, I will go out on 
a limb and make a prediction: weS™ re going to see a lot more of the
above qualification, that See Yeah, I used {platform} before it became known for being 
racist/sexist/misogynist/abusive etc.SD And that was only the first Substack thing todayS! LINK:

Kaleberg: 2525: S~IS™m not naturally optimistic, but I think you are too pessimistic on the 
technology fronta€! the golden age of materials sciences I glimpses of what is possible with 
nano-structures, bio-mimetics, non-traditional metallurgy, meta-materialsS! spin, as opposed to 
charge,
based electronics is much faster and uses much less power. New classes of reflective and 
transmissive materialsa€!. Much of that 2.1% technological growth has changed the commons. 
Rothschild couldnS™ t have bought a modern antibiotic, and neither can you. You can only SoebuySD

amoxicillin because we have a medical-pharmacological-health insurance-research complexS!. If you 
look to the future, it pays to think about what the commons can deliver, rather than individual 
components of it. Let me make some possibly correct predictions on this basis: In 2525, people will
not get cancera€!. People will be able to travel from point to point on the planet in less than 
fifteen minutesS!. Energy use per-capita will be lower than today, but heating, cooling, 
transportation and manufacturing will be more productive. Manufacturing will increasingly be 
as-neededS!. In
some ways, society advances one patent expiration at a timeS!
