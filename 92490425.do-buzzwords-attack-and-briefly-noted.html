I did, long ago, read a very nice, book by Russell Jacoby called <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/dialecticofdefea0000jaco">Dialectic of Defeat: Contours of Western Marxism</a>. </em>It was very worthwhile, even if written in embarrassingly crude-and-creaky New Leftese. Jacoby’s work did cast a long shadow on some of the other contributions than mine to our 2016 conference volume <em><a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/071Vq5aNMCn0tQxCojIjG6MVg">Public Intellectuals in the Global Arena:</a></em><a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/071Vq5aNMCn0tQxCojIjG6MVg"> </a><em><a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/071Vq5aNMCn0tQxCojIjG6MVg">Professors or Pundits?</a> </em>I do remember Dan Drezner citing Jacoby’s <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/lastintellectual0000jaco">The Last Intellectuals: American Culture in the Age of Academe</a><strong> </strong></em>in his 2017 <em><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Ideas_Industry/nHcLDgAAQBAJ">The Ideas Industry</a>.</em> Scanning my hard disk, I see his name come up in a few of my notes. So: someone who took the Long March from New Left (“I was part of a Boston bookstore ‘collective’ that interminably discussed everything from the titles the store should stock to the details of our lives…”) to, today, the Paleolithic Right:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Russell Jacoby</strong>: <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts-letters/articles/takeover-russell-jacoby">The Takeover: Self-righteous professors have spawned self-righteous students and unleashed them into the public square</a>: ‘The leftists who would have vanished as assistant professors in conferences on narratology and gender fluidity or disappeared as law professors with unreadable essays on misogynist hegemony and intersectionality have been pushed out into the larger culture… staff the ballooning diversity and inclusion commissariats that assault us…. Buzz words of the campus—diversity, inclusion, microaggression, power differential, white privilege, group safety—have become the buzz words in public life. Already confusing on campus, they become noxious off campus…</p></blockquote><p>Let me give the mic back to John Holbo:</p><blockquote><p>What indefensible barbarism do these buzz words buzz on behalf of, sez Jacoby? “Orwell targeted language that defended ‘the indefensible’... the British rule of India, Soviet purges and the bombing of Hiroshima.... But today, unlike in 1946, political language of Western progressives does not so much as defend the indefensible as defend the defendable.” </p><p>So they defend the… defendable. </p><p>That doesn’t sound SO indefensible...</p></blockquote><p>And I gotta concur with John. Jacoby feels beseiged by noxious buzzwords:</p><blockquote><p>Wonder about the significance of microaggression? You are a microaggressor. Have doubts about an eternal, all-inclusive white supremacy? You benefit from white privilege. Skeptical about new pronouns? You abet the suicide of fragile adolescents…</p></blockquote><p>I am at U.C. Berkeley.</p><p>If the Woke Beast has a belly, the place where I am must be its Ground Zero. </p><p>Yet in my personal experience: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Microaggressions: </strong>I have come home to my house to find my house-sitter and two of her friends sitting on the floor drinking wine, unburdening themselves on the microaggressions of being a female economics graduate student here at Berkeley. These are powerful, brilliant, capable, accomplished women all—and it grinds them down. It is one of the reasons why Economics does so badly and our pipeline of women (and underrepresented minorities!) leaks so much. Economics’s Talmud-like culture of challenge and debate has many advantages, but it does make microaggression (and macroaggression) a lifestyle. <br><br>So my reaction is: <em><strong>Time spent reflecting upon how to make the social world less of a zero-sum dominance and more of a positive-sum cooperation game is rarely wasted.<br></strong></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Pronouns: </strong>I had thought that the first principle of being a gentlemen is to treat people as they want to be treated, and, in polite society, at least, take their presentation-of-self at surface value: if a man is introducted to you as <em>Monsieur le Comte de St.-Germain</em>, you refer to him as <em>Monsieur le Comte.</em> If Jacoby wants to write a brief for how impolite society is superior, I might read it. But he has not done so. <br><br>So my reaction is: <em><strong>Adolescence is a time in which everyone is fragile, and needs sympathy and compassion.</strong></em> <em><strong>Civilization is empathy and consideration.

Should I join those like Russell Jacoby who complain about snowflakes—women are snowflakes who are annoyed when told in class that “solving this will put hair on their chest”—about those who want a different pronoun—they should just suck it up and recognize that they are “he” or “she”—and about those who tell them that something called “white privilege” played a substantial part in what success they have had?</p><p>Let’s think about: White privilege makes you a lucky person who has been, undeservedly, successful…</p><p>I head over to the internet to look at Jacoby’s <em>curriculum vitae</em>. I cannot find it anywhere. The closest I can find is not a .pdf but, instead, an email link to request it. </p><p>Odd.</p><p>Googling around, I find he became <em>professor emeritus</em> at UCLA in 2020. The UCLA website says “education: Universities of Chicago, Wisconsin and Rochester. Ph.D. Rochester, 1974”. I find little else until I follow a Google link over to a “World Biographical Encyclopedia”, of which I have never heard. Is it reliable? In any event, <a href="https://prabook.com/web/home.html">Prabook says</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Bachelor, University Wisconsin, 1967. Master of Arts, University Rochester, 1968.

He didn’t go from Ph.D. to tenure in seven years. He always saw himself as failing to run the course in the expected time, as hanging onto his academic post by his fingernails.</p><p>I drop over to Amazon’s “Look Inside the Book” feature. I am struck by the beginning of the acknowledgements to his 2020 <em>On Diversity:</em></p><blockquote><p>In my previous books I have been chagrined by the brevity of my acknowledgments; no lengthy roster of esteemed colleagues and devoted friends or rollcall of foundations, institutiosn, and conferences that fêted the author. Alas, my short list has barely changed over the decades…</p></blockquote><p>And I again guess: He sees himself not as lucky but as unlucky—as lacking the devoted friends, esteemed colleagues, and, perhaps most important, the hard-working and tireless but interested adversaries to read his stuff and point him in a better direction.</p><p>Plus: I am struck by the beginning of Jacoby’s introduction to the 1996 reissue of his 1975 <em>Social Amnesia:</em></p><blockquote><p>Social Amnesia… written amid the dying embers of the new left…. I was part of a Boston bookstore "collective" that interminably discussed everything from the titles the store should stock to the details of our lives. Anti-psychoanalytic sentiment…. Kate Millet's <em>Sexual Politics</em>…. The bookstore carried Pavlov… billed as a materialist and revolutionary, not Freud who was attacked as an idealist and reactionary…. What bothered me was not a sheer ignorance of psychoanalytic thinking, but the cheap criticism that Freud was nineteenth century…. The criticism implied that those who come later are smarter: the critics and their friends. This outlook had a great future…</p></blockquote><p>And I again guess: He sees himself not as lucky but as <em><strong>vastly</strong></em> unlucky: Even his friends were not his constructive adversaries but, rather, his enemies—in the sense that they made deliberate decisions to remain ignorant of what he saw as crucial.</p><p>So I think: Maybe what Jacoby is doing is crying out that <em><strong>he</strong></em> was not, personally, privileged?</p><p>Maybe what Jacoby really wants to say, but cannot quite bring himself to, is that his ancestors’ American white-ethnic experience was not all that easy, and he does not see his experience as all that easy? That others had it easier? That—let me list the surnames of my great-great-grandparents—the Wymans, Richardsons, Paysons, Ushers, Wards, Carters, Andersons, Lords, Slocums, Creases, Parkinsons, Bradfords, Siglins, Whipples, Gallaghers, and DeLongs had it easy, but the Jacobys did not? The Jacobys should be numbered not among the goats but among the sheep, on the side of the strivers who deserve good things, on the side of those who never yachted off of Marblehead or Newport, as opposed to the entitled parasites who did? <br><br>But if that is what he really means to say, then he should say that! </p><p>So by now I have constructed an image of Russell Jacoby in my mind’s eye. In this image, he REALLY does not like being called THE MAN—someone who has an unearned position, who benefits from white privilege, who needs to recognize that he is one of the, as F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote of Tom and Daisy Buchanan, “careless people” who can and does unthinkingly break things with their actions, and even their words, and so must be careful. </p><p>In the image in my mind’s eye HE REALLY REALLY RESENTS being told that there was anything “easy” about his life and career: About being born in New York in 1945. About leaving New York for Chicago as a teenager and then dropping out of the University of Chicago (for academic? financial?) reasons. About finishing his B.A. at lower-status (and cheaper!) Wisconsin-Madison in 1967. About using graduate-school to avoid being drafted and sent to Vietnam. About finding his New-Left commitments blocking him from getting the tenure-track job he deserved while the universities were still fat and growing through the mid-1970s, even as he recognized that they were idiots. About having three years to prove that he deserved a tenure-track slot, and it not appearing, and getting bounced. About trying to do it again. And again. And so on.</p><p>This image I have constructed does explain to me how ex-New Leftist Jacoby can write:</p><blockquote><p><em>The New York Times</em> published an opinion piece by Sen. Tom Cotton that called for the national guard to stem looting in the wake of the George Floyd riots. Employees of the<em> Times </em>protested and charged that the piece put Black staffers “in danger.” Again, this was an article in the editorial section of the paper, page 14. In the American adaption of Stalinist show trials, the editor of the opinion section [James Bennet] confessed. He regretted “the pain” he caused. He resigned…</p></blockquote><p>For, as John Holbo points out, that is not at all an adequate description of what went down:</p><blockquote><p>Jacoby has his parade.... But in each case (and others) isn’t it more complicated?... I’ll only offer one example.... Tom Cotton....

And <em><strong>NONE</strong></em> of the interest-rate increases the Fed has undertaken since its lift-off from zero will begin to have effects on inflation for at least another six months. The inflation trajectory is, so far, what it would have been had the Fed stayed at zero up to this moment. That means that there is, now, an awful lot of monetary contraction in the pipeline:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/26/opinion/is-the-inflation-storm-letting-up.html">Is the Inflation Storm Letting Up?</a>: ‘After the nasty shocks of the past two years, nobody wants to get too excited by positive news. Having greatly underestimated past inflation risks myself, I’m working hard on curbing my enthusiasm, and the Fed, which is worried about its credibility, is even more inclined to look for clouds in the silver lining…. But… What’s really striking about the improvement in inflation numbers is that so far, at least, it hasn’t followed the pessimists’ script. Disinflation, many commentators insisted, would require a sustained period of high unemployment—say, at least a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-20/summers-says-us-needs-5-jobless-rate-for-five-years-to-ease-cpi?sref=qzusa8bC">5 percent unemployment rate</a> for five years. And to be fair, this prediction could still be vindicated if recent progress against inflation turns out to be a false dawn.
