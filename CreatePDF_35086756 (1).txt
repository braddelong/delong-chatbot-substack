First:

What I told Neil Irwin about inflation:

The Federal Reservea€™ s inflation target has been that inflation should average a€” not ceiling, 
but average a€” 2 percent per year using the P.C.E., 2.5 percent per year using the
core C.P.I. Had inflation in fact matched that average since the beginning of the Great Recession, 
the core C.P.I. would now be 296 on a 1982-84=100 basis. It is actually 270.

If the Fed had hit its inflation target, the price level now would be 9.6 percent higher than it 
is. When the cumulative excess of C.P.I. core inflation over 2.5 percent per year reaches

+9.6 percent, come and ask me again whether Federal Reserve policy is excessively inflationary. 
Until then, we certainly have other much more important economic problems to
worry about than the risks of excessive and damaging inflation.

Paragraphs:

Dan Wang: China, the U.S., & Technology: a€~Last year, I read every issue of the partya€™ s main 
theory magazine, which is referred to as a€oeSeeking Trutha€D in Englisha€!.
I read every single one of Xi Jinpinga€™ s major speeches and major essaysa€!. The Communist Party 
doesna€™ t govern in itself. Ita€™ s structured to govern in symbiosis with
state institutions. And so a lot of the Communist Partya€™ s main roles for the last few decades 
has been to provide inspiration to the organizations in which it leads. It really wants
to inspire people about the transformative utopia, the communist future that the party wants to 
pursue. And then the other part is controla€!. A lot of this is about the Communist
Party referring back to its roots as a revolutionary combat party that had a major struggle before 
it could consolidate power, and then its goal is to transform the country into a
utopia.  A lot of this is the Partya€™ s means to try to really inspire people, and to keep working 
on these important goalsa€!. Ita€™ s an incredibly paranoid organization. It wants
total control of the narrative at all times, it just really detests criticisma€!.

Will Wilkinson: Codifying the Big Lie: a€~Ia€™ ve been trying to keep my cool, but the righta€™ s 
defense of new Republican-authored laws regulating elections, such as the one
recently established in Georgia, is so dishonest ita€™ s hard to stay on an even keela€!. ing their 
election-rigging agenda, as I see it: Pretend that no one has noticed that the
GOPa€™   s election reform proposals are based entirely on Donald Trumpa€™ s transparent lies about 
the electiona€!. Recast the January 6th insurrectiona€! as a peaceful protest
of legitimately concerned citizens that got a little rowdya€!. Simply ignore the fact that 
Republican votes on January 6th to reject the election results from Arizona, Georgia,
Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania just were votes for the mass disenfranchisement of Democratsa€!. 
Insist that new election regulations are needed to a€oerestore the confidence
of  voters ,a€D while playing dumb about the fact that Republicans undermined it in the first place 
by spreading liesa€! Generally and especially, treat your fellow citizens as though
they a€™ re idiots who fell off the turnip truck they were born on yesterdaya€! LINK:

Zeynep Tufekci: The Gaslighting of Science: a€~A lot of what was known from very early on took 
months, if not more, to make its way into our public health guidelines. Some are
still being debated, to great frustration. Perhaps one the most striking examples of all this is 
what happened with what we learned, and refused to learn, from the Diamond Princess
cruise ship in February of 2020, a tragic natural experiment if there ever was one. Thousands of 
people were trapped inside a cruise ship as the disease spread. Besides the tragedy,
it allowed us to observe what happened with the coronavirus inside a closed environment, revealing 
many things that could be harder to discern in a large, open citya€!. Jose-Luis
Jimenez: a€oeWith time I realized that aerosol scientists, including myself, have been gaslit in an 
industrial scale over the last yeara€!.a€D Ita€™ s not a good moment when a
prominent scientists’’who was, along with others, evidence-based, correct and prescient on a topic 
of great importance within his expertises’’feels the need to look up
SoegaslightingSD because he is lacking the word to otherwise describe his experiences!. As I close 
the misinformation trifecta series about problems beyond the ones that are
Sceover  there,SD committed by others, IS™ d like us not to forget what actually happened in more 
mainstream and arguably more important circles, and is still influencing

how we have been respondingS”and failing to responds”to this pandemic.S! LINK:

Herbert A. Simon: Organizations and Markets: S~A mythical visitor from Mars, not having been 
apprised of the centrality of markets and contracts, might find the new
institutional economics rather astonishingS!. A telescope that reveals social structuresS!. Firms 
reveal themselves, say, as solid green areas with faint interior contours marking
out divisions and departments. Market transactions show as red lines connecting firms, forming a 
network in the spaces between them. Within firms (and perhaps even between
them) the aonroachins visitor also sees Dale blue lines, the lines of authoritv connectins bosses 
with various levels of workers. As our visitor looked more carefullv at the scene


beneath, it might see one of the green masses divide, as a firm divested itself of one of its 
divisions. Or it might see one green object gobble up another. At this distance, the
departing golden parachutes would probably not be visible. No matter whether our visitor approached 
the United States or the Soviet Union, urban China or the European
Community, the greater part of the space below it would be within the green areas, for almost all 
of the inhabitants would be employees, hence inside the firm boundaries.
Organizations would be the dominant feature of the landscape. A message sent back home, describing 
the scene, would speak of a€oelarge green areas interconnected by red
lines  .a€D It would not likely speak of a€oea network of red lines connecting green spotsa€Da€!
