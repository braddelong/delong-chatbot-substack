Shown is the rolling 7-day average. The number of confirmed cases is lower than the number of 
actual cases; the main reason for that is limited
testing.

Paragraphs:

Adam Serwer: Texas Coronavirus Politics Are Dangerously Broken'. a€~Greg Abbott Surrenders to the 
Coronavirusa€!. The coronavirus pandemic should have been over by now, but instead the U.S. is 
facing what some medical experts have described as a a€oepandemic of the unvaccinated.a€Da€! 
Calling it a pandemic of the unvaccinated, however, may mislead some people into believing that the 
current wave is merely a problem for those who havena€™ t gotten the
shots. The surge is straining the statea€™ s hospital capacity, forcing Texans to delay medical 
procedures. Children under 12 remain unvaccinated, and some adolescents and adults who have gotten 
the shot, including those who are immunocompromised, remain vulnerablea€!. The longer so many 
people go unvaccinated, the more likely the evolution of even-more-deadly strains of the disease 
becomes. And, put simply, you should care when the people around you are dying
in droves of a preventable illnessa€!. The coronavirus surge is not entirely attributable to 
conservative mediaa€™ s irresponsible campaign against vaccines, which makes the campaign no less 
reprehensiblea€!. Although this misinformation is a real issue, and has driven a partisan divide in 
vaccination, not every unvaccinated person is being brainwashed by conservative media. The larger 
issue is that the conservative mediaa€™ s devotion to undermining vaccination
encourages Republican elected officials with political ambitions to make irresponsible 
public-health decisions, because they understand how media coverage shapes the attitudes of the 
GOPa€™ s voters. Vaccine mandates for things such as school and air travel are supported by more 
than 60 percent of Texans, despite the statea€™ s conservative lean. But Republican elected leaders 
fear the wrath of the GOP primary electorate more than they fear thousands of residents of
their  states dying of COVIDa€‘T9a€!. A pathetic irony is that Texas Republicans such as Senator 
Ted Cruz, who has proposed banning vaccine mandates on the federal level, formerly insisted that 
the seriousness of the pandemic was a liberal plot to harm Trump and would subside when he left 
office, as would liberal support for mitigation measures. But now Cruz, ever the craven 
apparatchik, the type of man who kissed the ring of someone who smeared his father and
insulted his wife, is opposing the policies that would more quickly end the pandemic and make such 
measures unnecessarya€!. Something is wrong when an extreme primary electorate has such a 
stranglehold on a state of 29 million people that a public official believes it is against his 
interest to take basic steps to keep his own constituents alive.

Omahaa€™ s Berkshire Hathaway bet on ChinaaC™ s BYD looks like ita€™ s paying off. Ita€™ s all

But it does have the right price and safe battery technology. Ita€™ s now ChinaaC™ s largest EV 
maker, selling more cars than the competition in the mainlanda€!
