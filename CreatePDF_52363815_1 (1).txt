FIRST: Marking My View of the Macroeconomic Outlook to Market

What is the incoming flow of data teaching me, as I try to keep my view of the macroeconomic 
outlook marked to market?

Indexed

In normal times, the gearing between the Federal Funds rate and the real Treasury 10-year rate is 
about 1/3: a 3%-point rise in the Federal Funds rate carries with it a 1%-point rise in the real 
Treasury 10-year rate. Since the start of this year, we have had an 0.25%-point rise in the Federal 
Funds rate, and aa 1%-point rise in the real Treasury 10-year ratea€”nine times the standard 
gearing. Why? Because monetary policy is not just the current level of the Fed
Funds rate, but is the current level plus all the forward guidance that gives the anticipated 
future path of the Fed Funds rate. In the shifts in monetary policy that you should pay attention 
to are not what the Fed does at its meetings, but rather the unexpected component of Fed actions, 
and the surrounding word cloud of communications that are the forward guidance.

If you thought at the start of this year that the Fed was behind the curve, and that it needed, 
through Fed-Funds rate increases and shifts in forward guidance, to do things with effects on 
long-term real interest rates that would be the equivalent of a 5%-point increase in the Fed Funds 
rate, then I have news for you: The Fed is 3/5 of the way there. If you thought, like me, that the 
costs of tightening too soon and being wrong were very higha€”that the 2010s were a
disaster, in which an Ainemic secularly-stagnant economy grossly underperformed in employment and 
productivity growth, substantially because the Fed had let itself get trapped at the zero lower 
bound in nominal interest ratesa€”then the past four months should lead you to think that the Fed 
is, if anything, slightly ahead of the curve right now, and should stay its (currently planned) 
course of Fed-Funds interest-rate increases, rather than accelerate them.

Rather than accelerate rate increases further, it should watch what changes in financial conditions 
over the past four months are about to do to the future of housing investment:

Shepherdson of Pantheona€l in a note last montha€!. a€oelta€™ s very hard to see why the private 
sector would feel compelled by a fed funds rate of 2 per cent or so by the end of this year to cut 
back spending to the point where the economy might tip into recessiona€!.. We expect a steep drop 
in housing market activity over the next

community-owned database part to protect against the builders of walled gardensS”is inevitably a 
public good, and a public good that can only exist if the database is properly managed and pruned

the medium money in it comes from degrading the quality of the trusted, decentralized,

A paper I need to unpack, for it is not at all obvious to me where this asymmetry in response could

sense that a firm with a vacancy has math exactly the same but inverse to a worker without a job:

with stubborn beliefs is small, the response of

We humans are smart only when we are engaged as parts of an anthology intelligence. Thata€™ s the 
start of pretty much every successful career is to figure out good anthology intelligence of humans 
to join. The middle is contributing to that anthology intelligence. We can none of us do it alone:

Joshua M Brown: How to Succeed: a€~Make yourself useful to smart, successful people. Thata€™ s how 
you should spend the first ten years of your career. Surround yourself with smart, successful 
people and then bet on them. Thata€™ s how you should spend the next ten years. And then youa€™re 
done, if you want to be done. Imagine someone had given you that advice at 22 and you followed it. 
Where would you be now?
Imagine if that advice were common knowledge rather than the kind of thing most people are forced 
to figure out for themselves? Therea€™ d be a lot more semi-retired 50 year olds walking around 
with enough money to do (or not do) whatever they want, seven days a week. Most of them would still 
be working on stuff, because ita€™ s a mentality thing, a personality type. Well, ita€™ s not 
common knowledge. I gave it to you now,
you can do with it as you choose. It worksa€!

Perhaps it is that ever since 1500 the key to understanding the battlefield is some version of 
rock-paper-scissors: originally, musket beats pike, pike beats cavalry, and cavalry beats 
musketa€”with artillery a joker to break up successful combined arms combinations if the 
battlefield is properly prepared. Through the ages, changes have been rung on this pattern, with 
the current question being what form this rock paper scissors will take over the next generation:
