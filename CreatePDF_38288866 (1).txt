This is an interactive jupyter notebook document.
Page down through it, following the instructions...

With what looks to be a permanent and long-run partial moving-online of the university, the already 
important topic of “data
science” seems likely to become even more foundational. Hence this first problem set tries to 
provide you with an
introduction—to “data science”, and to the framework we will be using for problem sets that we hope 
will make things
much easier for you and for us...

When you are finished, satisfied, or stuck, print your notebook to pdf, & upload the pdf to the 
appropriate assignment

Also, please include with your submission all of your comments on and reactions to this assignment 
that you want us to

Paul Krugman
@paulkrugman
A-

Jun 19

Monetarisma€”the claim that monetary aggregates like Ml or M2 drive the economy, and that 
stabilizing them is all policy needs to doa€”is dead, and should never have had the influence it 
did. James Tobin was right in 1970: to the extent that there was a correlation between monetary 
aggregates and GDP (there hasn't been much of one in recent decades), Friedman had the causation 
reversed <https: //jstor.org/stable/1883016>.

Brad DeLong: 'Live long, & prosper!1: The consumption function work was gooda€”albeit overstated. 
"Incomes from Professional Practice" on the role played by the AMA and the state bar associations 
in boosting doctors' and lawyers' incomes and keeping them high is very good. "Roofs or Ceilings?" 
is at least half right: markets ration the available supply by (ability to pay) x (relative 
intensity of demand); price controls ration available supply some other
way, and send a signal to profit-seeking capital to shift investment resources elsewhere. I don't 
think F&S have it right but their principal targets have it very wrong indeed. Cf. the "grain 
supply" debate in France in the late 1700s, which is actually more sophisticated in elements than 
F&S.

It's the "Keynes was wrong: you don't need a 'somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment" 
to balance the macroeconomy; all you need is a k% growth rule for M2" is where he went really 
wronga€”he was smart enough to have thought up Goodhart's Law all by himself, but never did. And 
the political-economy rent-seeking society posturing was much more embarrassing than insightful. In 
my view, Milton Friedman has the defect of a hedgehog
whose one big trick is not, in reality, a very good one. And there are grave dangers in trying to 
do research when you know what the conclusions are, and the task is only how are you going to. 
manage to get there.

His work is best approached best the way I always approached Martin Feldstein's: we know what the 
conclusion will be, and he has done us the useful service of laying out the strongest argument you 
can make for that conclusion. But as a mode of training Friedman's way of proceeding turned a lot 
of people who could have been second-rate economists into fourth-rate ones. Remember Jagdish 
Bhagwati (no left-wingera€’’rather, a man who, appallingly, claimed
TCJA would pay for itself!) on life at Friedman's Chicago...

We have not mentioned that the a€oenight watchmana€D state is itself a very powerful enterprise, 
able to make and enforce its own judgments about who a€oeownsa€D what against not just against 
roving bandits, but local notables and even its own functionaries. Friedmana€™ s minimal state is 
not so minimal, after all: It rips the economy out of society, and gives each individual control 
over their economic resources rather than finding themselves tied down
like Gulliver in what they can do with their "property" and so subject to the sociological network 
of domination and hierarchy. Friedmana€™ s minimal state is not so minimal, after all.

Paul Krugman: a€~Urp. I dona€™ t think economics is failing; in many ways I think ita€™ s better 
than ever. But that aside, this gets the history of communication in the field all wrong. Tyler 
conveys the impression that we went straight from The General Theory to Twitter. I was there for a 
lot of the transition, and thata€™ s not how it went. The truth is that not much economic 
discussion has taken place through books for a very long time. In fact, even
journal articles have long been tombstonesa€’’things you had to publish for tenure, but lagging far 
behind the discussion. Even pre-internet communication mainly took place via working papers, which 
had completely taken over all the fields I worked in by the 1980s. No peer review, and obvious 
privileging of people with known names and connections, but still an effective dissemination 
system. Econoblogging in its heyday was also an effective system for
disseminating ideas; it has been largely crowded out by Twitter, which is unfortunate, but many 
have found workarounds. In particular, a lot of econ Twitter is summaries of and links to working 
papers. So it isna€™ t actually casual and sloppy; more like abstracts for serious work. And the 
work is indeed serious, with tough questions and debate, informed by data, taking place in real 
time. Traditional peer review has fallen on hard times. But the quick back and
forth  among people who know their field serves a similar purpose, and maybe better. Think of the 
2010a€“13 debate over fiscal policy; Ia€™ d stack that against any great econ debates of the past. 
And how anyone can look at the current arguments over fiscal policy, or minimum wages, or 
unemployment benefits and say that economists have become too cautious and polite baffles mea€!

Paul Krugman: a€™ As I read it, there are two propositions being suggested. 1. The Fed cana€™ t 
rein in an overheating economy without causing a recessio. 2. The Fed cana€™ t rein in the economy 
without a recession if it waits until inflation is embedded in expectations and contracts. #1 is 
clearly false. #2 is probably true. But LHS seems to elide them; if you press him he makes point 
#2, but people reading his public pronouncements think hea€™ s saying
#1.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                    
    And when that sort of thing happens, ita€™ s not the readersa€™ faulta€™ . Joseph Gagnon: a€™ 
Agree. The history of Fed causing recessions to fight inflation occurred in the context of no clear 
policy framework and unanchored inflation expectations. That is not going to happen again. Of 
course, the Fed could still make a mistakea€! LINK: <
