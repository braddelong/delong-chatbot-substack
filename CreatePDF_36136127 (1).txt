In Vernor Vingea€™ s space-opera novel A Fire Upon the Deep, the character Twirlip a€oeof the 
Mistsa€D knowsa€”at some level, somehowa€”that out in the broader galaxy to which it is barely 
connected that those sapient bushes riding around on six-wheeled scooters have been genetically 
programmed to be a Fifth Column of spies and agents for the Great Evil. Hence a€oeHexapodia as the 
key insighta€”because it is not too clear on the
locomotion of ground dwellers, and does not distinguish between wheels and feet.

Noah Smith and I take a lesson from this: that there is often some key nugget of fact thata€”if you 
grok it correctly and place it in its proper contesta€”will transform your view of the situation, 
and allow you to grok it correctly. Of course, it is very difficult to do so.

Hexapodia as the Key Insight:

From Vernor Vinge: A Fire Upon the Deep <https: //books .google .com/books ?id=UGAKB 3rO sZQC>:

And some messages were patent nonsense. One thing about the Net: the multiple, automatic 
translations often disguised the fundamental alienness of participants. Behind the chatty, 
colloquial postings, there were faraway realms, so misted by distance and difference that 
communication was impossible a€” even though it might take a while to realize the fact. For 
instance:

Key phrases: Hexapodia as the key insight

Text of message: I haven't had a chance to see the famous video from Straumli Realm, except as an 
evocation. (My only gateway onto the Net is very expensive.) Is it true that humans have six legs? 
I wasn't sure from the evocation. If these humans have three pairs of
legs, then I think there is an easy explanation for a€"

Hexapodia? Six legs? Three pairs of legs? Probably none of these translations was close to what the 
bewildered creature of Twirlip had in its mind. Ravna didn't read any more of that postinga€!.
[a€i]

So Ravna used the ship to do light culling on the Threats newsgroup. Much of what was left was 
inane, as from people who see "portents in the weather" a€”

Subject: The Blight's goal at the Bottom

Distribution: Threat of the Blight Great Secrets of Creation
Date: 4.54 days since Fall of Sjandra Kei

Key phrases: Zone Instability and the Blight, Hexapodia as the key insight

Text of message: Apologies first if I am repeating obvious conclusions. My only gateway onto the 
Net is very expensive, and I miss many important postings. I think that anyone following both Great 
Secrets of Creation and Threat of the Blight would see an important
pattern. Since the events reported by Harmonious Repose information service, most agree that 
something important to the Perversion exists at the Bottom of the Beyond in region [...]. I see a 
possible connection here with the Great Secrets. During the last two hundred and
twenty days, there have been increasing reports of zone interface instability in the region below 
Harmonious Repose. As the Blight threat has grown and its attacks against advanced races and other 
Powers continued, this instability has increased. Could there not be some
connection? I urge all to consult their information on the Great Secrets (or the nearest archive 
maintained by that group). Events such as this prove once again that the universe is all ronzelle 
between a€"

Some of the postings were tantalizinga€!.

And then there is one last passage with no authorial-voice context:

Subject: The cause of the recent Great Surge

Distribution:  Threat  of  the  Blight  Great  Secrets  of  Creation  Zonometric  Interest  Group
Date: 66.47 days since Fall of Sjandra Kei

Key phrases: Zone Instability and the Blight, Hexapodia as the key insight

Text  of  message:  Apologies  if  I  am  repeating  obvious  conclusions.  My  only  gateway  onto 
 the  Net  is  very  expensive,  and  I  miss  many  important  postings.  The  Great  Surge  now  
in  progress  appears  by  all  accounts  to  be  an  event  of  cosmic  scope  and  rarity.  
Furthermore,  the  other
posters  put  its  epicenter  less  than  6,000  light-years  from  recent  warfare  related  to  
the  Blight.  Can  this  be  mere  coincidence?  As  has  long  been  theorized  [citations  from  
various  sources,  three  known  to  A~lvira  ;  the  theories  cited  are  of  long  standing  and 
 nondisprovable]
the  Zones  themselves  may  be  an  artifact,  perhaps  created  by  something  beyond  
Transcendance  for  the  protection  of  lesser  forms,  or  [hypothetical]  sentient  gas  clouds  
in  galactic  cores.  Now  for  the  first  time  in  Net  history  we  have  a  Transcendent  
form,  the  Blight,  that  can
effectively  dominate  the  Beyond.  Many  on  the  Net  [cites  Hanse  and  Sandor  at  the  Zoo]  
believe  that  it  is  searching  for  an  artifact  near  the  Bottom.  Is  it  no  wonder  that  
this  could  upset  the  Natural  Balance  and  provoke  the  recent  Event?  Please  write  to  me 
 and  tell  me  what
you   think. I don't get much mail a€"

Vernor Vingea€™ s Notes:

Note 601. 1. [vsv] Heh, heh: ... or three pairs of wheels? I wonder what would have happened if 
Ravna had just read a little further. In some weird way, Twirlip knows the Secret of the Riders. I 
wonder how many people will catch this. It's really not up to the level of a legitimate clue (I 
didn't notice it until after I wrote it) a€” but if it were, Ravna would have instantly caught on 
to it. This is a special case of something you might
use elsewhere: Even though the Known Net has enormous connectivity, the interests of the 
participants and the prejudices of the newsfilter software would tend to create virtual partitions. 
There could be large segments that, sometimes unknowingly, are ignoring each other. Most of the 
time this would just improve efficiency; in some cases great insights would be lost. (Hence, I bet 
some people or their automation would expend
lots of effort dredging the unintelligible. Even that would not eliminate the problem.)

Note 1165 1. Twirlip priors: file 13, speculation based on human hexapodia file 15, speculation 
that Zone instab is connected to the Blighter threat. Twirlip may know all the big secrets, but 
it's just too strange for credible translations a€” hence its permanent crank status throughout 
this story.
