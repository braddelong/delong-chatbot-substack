BRIEFLY NOTED: First:

Jared Bernstein & Ernie Tedeschi: Pandemic Prices: Assessing Inflation in the Months & Years 
Ahead'. a€~In the next several months we expect measured inflation to increase somewhat, primarily 
due to three different temporary factors: base effects, supply chain disruptions, and pent-up 
demand, especially for services. We expect these three factors will likely be transitory, and that 
their impact should fade over time as the economy recovers from the
pandemic. After that, the longer-term trajectory of inflation is in large part a function of 
inflationary expectations. Here, too, we see some increase, but from historically low to more 
normal levels. We explain our reasoning belowa€! LINK:

•  Sharon Cho: A Key Oil Spread Points to Price War Erupting as Supply Expands'. a€~Earlier this 
month the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies decided to relax the deep 
production curbs that rescued prices from last yeara€™ s pandemic-driven collapse. The move will 
see more than 2 million barrels a day in supply restored in stages through to July amid 
expectations that the roll-out of vaccines will underpin further gains
in energy consumption^!

frankly just bad. Ignoring tail risks. Obsessively focusing on carbon taxes. Criticizing academic 
economists is tough. They tend to instantly circle the wagons and scoff dismissivelya€!

Paragraphs:

Dan Wang: China, the U.S., & Technology: a€~Beijing still recognizes that the private sector has 
been generating almost the entirety of the dynamism over the last few decades. The state still 
needs to keep control of the commanding heights, but it is not yet ready to squash out the private 
sector as a wholea€!. I think the US problem here is premature abstraction. You are focused on 
these consumer companies, these internet companies that have completely
abstracted away the real world. These things are capital light, theya€™re fantastically profitable 
and I think what actually matters, the hard part, are the gears and the pipes and the machinery to 
actually power these things and that is what Ia€™m drawn aesthetically towards and that is what 
China is focused much more about buildinga€!

Paul Krugman: Trumpa€™ s Corporate Tax Cut Was a Flop: a€~I want to talk abouta€! why even many 
critics, myself included, thought the Trump tax cut was less bad than the usual Republican tax 
plan, followed by three reasons we were, it turned out, too kinda€L Republican tax cuts are usually 
concentrated on high-income individuals, and are justified with the claim that cutting marginal tax 
rates will lead to an explosion in individual effort,
entrepreneurship, and so ona€!. There have been many debunkingsa€!. The rationale for the corporate 
tax cut was, however, quite different. It wasna€™ t about individual work effort; instead, it was 
about incentives to invest in the United States as opposed to other nations. Thata€™ s clearly a 
real issue in a world of mobile capitala€!. I accepted this logic, at least as a qualitative 
matter. I still thought the tax cut was a bad idea, but that was because I believed
that      the inflow of capital would be smaller and take much longer than the plana€™ s advocates 
claimed, and as a result wouldna€™ t be enough to compensate for the loss of revenue. But I was, it 
turned out, being too generous. As a 2019 analysis by the International Monetary Fund found, the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ended up having no visible effect at all on business investment^!. How can we 
understand this abject failure? I see three reasons, one of which I
missed completely back in 2017, two of which I knew about but didna€™t give sufficient weighta€!. 
The corporate profits tax isna€™t a tax on capital, ita€™ s a tax on a particular aspect of 
corporate financial structure. Analysesa€”mine included!a€’’that treat it simply as raising the 
cost of capital are being far too generous to tax cutters. Business investment isna€™t that 
sensitive to the cost of capital, anywaya€!. Most business assets are fairly short-
liveda€!.                                                                                           
                                                                                                    
                And demand for short-lived assets isna€™ t very sensitive to the cost of capital. 
[Ita€™ s] the demand for houses [that] depends hugely on the interest rate borrowers have to 
paya€!. Monopoly: Financial industry types often talk about the FAANGs: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, 
Netflix, Google a€” tech companies that loom large in the stock market. These companies look very 
different from past market leaders like General Motors in its heyday;
ita€™ s much harder to link their value to the tangible assets they owna€!. The profit tax is at 
this point largely a tax on monopoly or quasi-monopoly profitsa€!. NaA“ve calculations of the 
effect of tax cuts on business investment have to be a€oegeared downa€Da€l. But why did anyone ever 
believe that corporate tax cuts would do great things for the economy? The big argument for cutting 
corporate taxes has long been that if we dona€™ t, corporations will

move capital and jobs to lower-tax nationsa€!. What wea€™ ve learned over the past 7 or 8 years, 
however, is that wea€™re mainly looking at accounting tricks rather than real capital flighta€!. 
The Trump tax cut is that it didna€™ t reverse capital flight because the capital flight never 
happened in the first placea€!. The U.S. government gave up hundreds of billions of dollars to fix 
a nonexistent problem. Now the Biden administration wants to go after the real
problem, which was always tax avoidance, not loss of jobs to foreigners. Will they manage to pass 
the necessary legislation? Wea€™ll just have to wait and see.
