Alexander Hamilton (December 23,1800): To Harrison Gray Otis: a€~I lose no time in replying to your 
letter of the 17a€”this day received.

My opinion is, after mature reflection, that if Jefferson and Burr come with equal votes to the 
House of Representatives, the former ought to be preferred by the [struck: House of 
Representatives] Federalists. Mr. Jefferson is respectably known in Europea€”Mr. Burr little and 
that little not advantageously for [struck: the][inserted: a] President of the U Statesa€”Mr. 
Jefferson is a man of easy fortunea€”Mr. Burr, as I believe, a bankrupt beyond redemption,
unless by some coup at the expence of the public, and his habits of expence are such that Wealth he 
must have at any ratea€”Mr. Jefferson is a man of fair character for probity a€’’Very different 
ideas are entertained of Mr. Burr by his enemies and what his friends think, you may collect from 
this anecdotea€”A lady said to Edward Livingston ironically a€oel am told Mr. Burr will be 
President. I should like it very well if I had not [struck: been told] [inserted:
heard] that he is a man without property a€”a€DLet him alone for that replied Edwarda€”If he is 
President for four years he will remove the objection"a€”Mr. Jefferson, though too revolutionary in 
his notions, is yet a lover of liberty and will be desirous of something like orderly Governments 
”Mr. Burr loves nothing but himselfa€” thinks of nothing but his own aggrandizements’’and will be 
content with nothing short of permanent power [struck: and] in his
own handsS”No compact, that he should make with any [struck: other] passion in his [struck: own] 
breast except [struck: his] Ambition, could be relied upon by himselfS”How then should we be able 
to rely upon any agreement with him? Mr. Jefferson, I suspect will not dare much Mr. Burr will 
[inserted in margin: dare every thing in the sanguine hope of effecting every thingS”] If Mr. 
Jefferson is likely from predilection for France to draw the Country
into War on her sideS”Mr. Burr will certainly endeavour to do it for the sake of creating the means 
of personal power and wealth.

This portrait is the result of long and attentive observation on a [strikeout] man with whom I am 
personally wella€”and in respect to whose character I have had peculiar opportunities of forming a 
correct judgment.
By no means, my Dear Sir, let the Federalists be responsible for his Elevationa€”In a choice of 
Evils let them take the leasta€’’Jefferson is in every view less dangerous than Burr.

But we ought a€“ still to seek some advantages from our situation. It may be adviseable to make it 
[strikeout][inserted: a] ground of exploration with Mr. Jefferson or his confidential friends and 
the means of obtaining from him some assurances of his future conduct. The three essential points 
for us to secure is. 1 The continuance of the neutral plan bonafide towards the belligerent powers 
2 The preservation of the present System of public credita€”3 The
maintenance & gradual increase of our navy. Other matters may be left to take their chance.

While I have my pen in hand, I will express some ideas to you about the Convention with Francea€”I 
am far from approving several of its features but I am clear that it ought now to be ratified 
having been negotiated & that the not doing of it would ruin the Federal party, hazard our internal 
tranquillity, and leave the door open for a worse arrangement under the new Administration. One 
question will be whether this Treaty is compatible with our [struck:
Federal] engagements to Great Britain. I hold it to be the better opinion that it is. It seems to 
me that the annulling of our Treaties with France is a matter between her and us by which another 
power ought neither to gain nor losea€”that in terminating these differences we might have gone 
back to the Status quo ante bellum & that no power not put in worse situation than before would 
have a right to complain.

Yrs. with great [aft & resp] A Hamilton
