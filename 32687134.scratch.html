Reverse osmosis is teh preferred solution, forcing the water out through a membrane leaving the brine more salty behind. This is done by overcoming the osmotic pressure…. Evaporation is another method that tends to be less effective but does have the advantage of using free solar energy in a desert…. The other issue is the transport of so much water. For California, it might mean hundreds of miles of pipes or waterways to distribute the water (uphill in some cases) to where it is needed, adding to the cost…. he last problem is what to do with the saltier brines…. In extremis, the desalination would have to replace all the water from the snowpack and winter rainfall, and at least some of that must keep the rivers and lakes supplied. And we haven’t even addressed… rising sea level, salt intrusions into the aquifers, etc. due to all that energy use…. I don’t see human nature and attitudes changing that much this century, at least not in the conservative San Joaquin Valley, which leads me to be somewhat pessimistic about future “water wars” in the state that could make today’s conflicts seem almost trivial.… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/for-paying-subscribers-in-the-year/comments?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNjg3OSwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzMyODIxODQsIl8iOiJ5aURXViIsImlhdCI6MTYxNTAzOTc2OCwiZXhwIjoxNjE1MDQzMzY4LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItNDc4NzQiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.M_3YgkOkqn_Ow8oRFIa9QC_Gu4PaWNIYJX500huvCDM#comment-1428623">https://braddelong.substack.com/p/for-paying-subscribers-in-the-year/comments?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNjg3OSwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzMyODIxODQsIl8iOiJ5aURXViIsImlhdCI6MTYxNTAzOTc2OCwiZXhwIjoxNjE1MDQzMzY4LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItNDc4NzQiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.M_3YgkOkqn_Ow8oRFIa9QC_Gu4PaWNIYJX500huvCDM#comment-1428623</a>&gt;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>https://twitter.com/hshierholz/with_replies</p><p></p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1369998504844787719&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Happy to join in the ridicule of this.

Real wages over this period were heavily influenced by plague-induced swings in the population. We develop and implement a new methodology for estimating productivity that accounts for these Malthusian dynamics. In the early part of our sample, we find that productivity growth was zero. Productivity growth began in 1600—almost a century before the Glorious Revolution. Post–1600 productivity growth had two phases: an initial phase of modest growth of 4% per decade between 1600 and 1810, followed by a rapid acceleration at the time of the Industrial Revolution to 18% per decade. Our evidence helps distinguish between theories of why growth began. In particular, our findings support the idea that broad-based economic change preceded the bourgeois institutional reforms of 17th century England and may have contributed to causing them. We also estimate the strength of Malthusian population forces on real wages. We find that these forces were sufficiently weak to be easily overwhelmed by post–1800 productivity growth… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/article-bouscasse-akamura-steinsson.pdf">https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/article-bouscasse-akamura-steinsson.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Yonatan Zunger</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Tolerance Is Not a Moral Precept. The Title of This Essay Should Disturb You</em>: ‘As with any peace treaty, we must consider toleration in the broader context of the war which is its alternative, and we must recognize that peace is not always a possibility…. Among the worst wars of tolerance were the religious wars which tore through Europe between 1524 and 1648…. Protestants and Catholics each seeing the other as existential threats…. These wars came to an end… each ruler had the right to choose the religion of their state, and that Christians living in principalities where their faith was not the established faith still had the right to practice their religion. A decision was made, in essence, to accept the risk of the monster rather than the reality of the war…. Tolerance, viewed as a moral absolute, amounts to renouncing the right to self-protection; but viewed as a peace treaty, it can be the basis of a stable society. Its protections extend only to those who would uphold it in turn. To withdraw those protections from those who would destroy it does not violate its moral principles; it is fundamental to them, because without this enforcement, the treaty would collapse. It is appropriate, even ethical, to answer force with proportional force, when that force is required to restore a just peace. We seek peace because on the whole it is far better than war; but as history has taught us, not every peace is better than the war it prevents… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://extranewsfeed.com/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376">https://extranewsfeed.com/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Yuval Noah Harari</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Lessons from a Year of Covid</em>: ‘Automation and digitalisation have had an even more profound impact on services.

Don’t share your screen: when making a presentation, screen sharing is almost always the worst option, except in some specific cases (use of spreadsheets, etc.) Instead, share your presentations using the virtual camera, or use the virtual backgrounds to locate your presentation.

To say that net output to-day is greater, but the price-level lower, than ten years ago or one year ago, is a proposition of a similar character to the statement that Queen Victoria was a better queen but not a happier woman than Queen Elizabeth—a proposition not without meaning and not without interest, but unsuitable as material for the differential calculus.

First, there has been a trend towards unconditional convergence since the 1960s, leading to convergence since the early 2000s. Second, policies and institutions have converged substantially, towards development-favored institutions - those associated, across countries, with higher levels of in- come. Third, the institutional changes are larger, on average, than those predicted by the cross-sectional income-institution slope; while the slope itself has remained stable. Fourth, the growth-institution slope - the coefficients of growth regressions - has decreased substantially, resulting in a shrinking in the gap between conditional and unconditional convergence.
