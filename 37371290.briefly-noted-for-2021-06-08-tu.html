Nomadic and martial, ruthlessly disciplined, and deeply attuned to their horses, they have astonishing field-, wood-, and warcraft, and the knowledge and capacity to heal in ways that seem mystical to ordinary people—with whom they do not intermarry. And they possess weapons that can kill preternatural evil as ordinary weapons cannot. Every word applies equally to Lakewalkers and Dúnedain, and this is not imitation but critique, for there are also pointed differences, and the Lakewalkers’ struggle is by far the bleaker…. The Dúnedain, that is, struggle in hope, buoyed by received wisdoms promising deliverance and assisted by beings and artefacts of ancient, sometimes preternatural provenance; Lakewalkers, contrariwise, struggle without hope of deliverance, knowing a single failure will end the world, and their only artefacts of power are worked from their own bones and sacrifices…. Nor do Lakewalkers have any certain knowledge of the past that led to their present, even their legends being fragmentary…. Bujold has repeatedly confirmed that she was consciously engaging with Tolkien’s masterwork and the subgenre it created…. In a discussion on Jo Walton’s Tor blog in 2009, someone complained that The Sharing Knife did not have a proper ending, because evil was not ultimately defeated, and Bujold, rather (I imagine) banging her head on her desk, replied: "Not only was [the Ultimate Defeat of All Evil] not the story I was telling, it was the story my entire 1600 page story was arguing against…. There is a trick to deliberately thwarting reader expectations—you have to deliver in the end something as good or better….

First she blames human nature, as well as the nature of life in America… “woke” mainstream-media newsrooms… those who implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID–19 that Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott didn’t like… The Transgender Menace… corporate progressivism, and activist progressivism… “the elites”… technology…. But she never blames the people who are spreading the conspiracy theories. Trump isn’t at fault. Her employer, Rupert Murdoch, isn’t at fault. The rest of the right-wing media isn’t at fault. Conspiratorial Republican politicians aren’t at fault. The people who write and retransmit QAnon posts and election-theft propaganda aren’t at fault. We made them believe this stuff, with our woke atheist transgender elitism. We made them concoct this nonsense, we made them spread it, we made them consume it. They didn’t want to. But we’re so awful that they had no choice!… This is her happy place—blaming us for everything. It’s every other establishment right-winger’s happy place, too, which might be why so many of them want to dump Trump and the conspiratorialists.

To speak earnestly on Twitter is to invite mockery and a sudden outpouring of contempt from total strangers…. I have made more friends through Twitter than any other place, physical or digital. Beyond this close circle of friendship are those looser ties with people who I gain much from, through the simple joy of conversation. And the audience I have built, however modest, around myself and around Liberal Currents, I owe to Twitter more than any other scene…. But antagonism is more likely than agreement, for antagonism draws a more energetic response, from the one replied to or their followers. And of course, the quote-tweet putting a hostile frame on the quoted tweet is one of the most common paths to that promised land, going viral.

Speaking about Steve Forbes, a Kemp-like optimist, Pat Buchanan in 1996 said, “It’s big rock candy mountain conservatism. They think economics is the answer to everything. You’ve got violence in the cities: Cut taxes and put enterprise zones in there and everything’s going to be fine, and it’s not. There’s a much broader dimension to America’s crises: It’s moral, it’s social, it’s economic, it’s spiritual.” If you believe that the purpose of politics is, at core, to preserve a white American identity that you perceive to be under threat (from moral, social and spiritual enemies), then simply electing Republicans with the help of more non-white voters isn’t something you’re interested in. A broader Republican party will, from this point of view, be less loyal to the historical America, the white-dominated America, that the political right wants to defend. If that is your starting point, then shrinking the electorate is in fact the only way to go. A multicultural Republican party would be a defeat.&nbsp;As Buchanan understood, politics isn’t just about policies. It’s also about mood. Kemp’s sunny, up-beat conservatism didn’t appeal to people whose worldview has a darker, more pessimistic bent, people for whom America’s changing demographics represent not opportunity but the end of their way of life. Can anyone deny that Buchanan’s somber outlook is more popular on the right than Kemp’s cheerfulness? Who, now, even remembers Jack Kemp?… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://jeetheer.substack.com/p/is-the-gop-war-on-democracy-self">https://jeetheer.substack.com/p/is-the-gop-war-on-democracy-self</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-06-08-tu/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-06-08-tu/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>(Remember: You can subscribe to this… weblog-like newsletter… here:&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>There’s a free email list.
