Scientific and technological developments during the two wars… determined the social trends, economic institutions and industrial policies in the period that followed. What was different about the second half of the 20th century, in Sperber’s account, was the depth and speed of political, economic and informational exchanges that criss-crossed the globe, “integrating far-flung continents and countries of very different levels of economic development, social structures, and political systems”…. Global uniformities and interconnections were forged by design…. Smartly defined at the outset, the analysis subsequently dissolves in a bath of granular detail. Brute empiricism has won an expensive victory over both synoptic vision and, presumably, wider readership…. Those in the market for minutiae such as crop breeding, Asian stewardesses, or international sales of Tupperware will find <em>The Age of Interconnection </em>useful; those looking for overarching theories or conceptually rich accounts of the modern order, as found in the macrosociology of Michael Mann or the world-system analysis of Immanuel Wallerstein, will find little revelation. Sperber’s… reverence for <em>The Transformation of the World</em>, Jürgen Osterhammel’s 1,000-page opus on the 19th century…. Sperber shares Osterhammel’s view that it isn’t possible “to fix the dynamic of an epoch in a single schema”…. And what of neoliberalism? The term itself, as well as “liberalism”, appears only once in the book, a striking absence given its dominance over the thought-world of the West for the last half century...</p></blockquote><p>This is a “he did not write the book that I would have written!” review. </p><p>Here’s my thumbnail excerpt from Sperber:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Jonathan Sperber</strong>: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Interconnection-History-Twentieth-Century/dp/0190918950/">The Age of Interconnection: A Global History of the Second Half of the Twentieth Century</a>: ‘Imagining the Era…. 1. The rate of global economic and population growth over the years 1950– 73… greater than at any previous time…. 2. In 1950, the United States was the only country in the world with at least 250 privately owned automobiles per thousand people…. By 2000, there were twenty-four countries…. 3. In the five years after the end of the Second World War, one person in thirteen in the world was a refugee. 4. About one-tenth as many people were killed in wars of the second half of the twentieth century as during the two World Wars…. 5. The decolonization of Asia and Africa… saw the end of the largest colonial empires in human history. 6.… Human presence in space has been limited to low earth orbit…. 7. As late as 1960, atmospheric CO2 levels were little above their preindustrial values…. 8. By 2000, there were more women university students than men…. 9. In 1960… commercial passenger aircraft were propeller planes; by 1970… jets. 10…. antibiotics… DDT, and… mass vaccination… reduced infectious disease so drastically in the quarter century after 1945…. 11. In 1995, there were only sixteen million users of the Internet… Five years later… 361 million…. How [can] all these… be understood as part of a broader historical process, and not merely as a succession of disconnected headlines[?]…</p></blockquote><p>As I have said, I remember one coffee with Berkeley colleagues where all three of us agreed we would each give a limb to write something as great as Jonathan’s <em>Karl Marx: A 19th-Century Life</em>. </p><p>This book is not quite so good. I am not so sure that there can be a thematic unity for the period 1950 to 2000. But, if there can be, Jonathan's decision to make it “interconnection” appears to me to be the most fruitful theme to explore. </p><p>And so I blurbed it: “A truly brilliant, gripping, and readable history of the 1945-2001 world, making a very persuasive case that globalization is the main thread for economics, politics, and sociology in moving toward not utopia but at least a world in which a smaller proportion of us are in dire want and desperate fear.”</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2023-01-09-mo?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2023-01-09-mo?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>ONE IMAGE: <strong>Elon Musk Did Nazi This Coming!:</strong></h2><p>But he really should have…</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0ed3249-247d-434a-bcda-9c0a47f082d7_1064x1188.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0ed3249-247d-434a-bcda-9c0a47f082d7_1064x1188.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0ed3249-247d-434a-bcda-9c0a47f082d7_1064x1188.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0ed3249-247d-434a-bcda-9c0a47f082d7_1064x1188.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0ed3249-247d-434a-bcda-9c0a47f082d7_1064x1188.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f0ed3249-247d-434a-bcda-9c0a47f082d7_1064x1188.png" width="1064" height="1188" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f0ed3249-247d-434a-bcda-9c0a47f082d7_1064x1188.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1188,&quot;width&quot;:1064,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:761244,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0ed3249-247d-434a-bcda-9c0a47f082d7_1064x1188.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0ed3249-247d-434a-bcda-9c0a47f082d7_1064x1188.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0ed3249-247d-434a-bcda-9c0a47f082d7_1064x1188.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0ed3249-247d-434a-bcda-9c0a47f082d7_1064x1188.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Elon Musk: Sufficiently stupid to buy Peter Theil’s line that to be pro-democracy is to be “politically biased”.

For a long time, the way we’ve tried to make this relationship work is by creating organizational systems. The best way to make sure future versions of ourselves had the right notes at the right time was by constructing Rube Goldberg machines of tags, notebook hierarchies, and bi-directional links…. But ultimately, the organizing solutions we’ve built are brittle. We build and abandon new systems all the time, and rarely, if ever, go back to look at old notes…. Paying for a new notes tool is like signing up for a gym membership on January 1. You know you’ll abandon it, but the money you spend soothes your anxiety about not making the most of what you have. AI changes this equation….

ChatGPT and other devices are smart in a way humans are not. So you have to up your estimate on the possibility of other kinds of intelligences being quite impressive. ChatGPT gets smart in large part because it has so much training data. [In terms of] just having access to a lot of training data in your environment, it seems a lot of animals, plants, etc. have that. So your estimate about how easy it is for intelligence to evolve should go up somewhat.

Yhere’s also a secret three-page addendum that McCarthy and his allies hashed out during several days of grueling negotiations…. Tony Gonzales (Texas) and Nancy Mace (S.C.)… complain… McCarthy gave up too much…. Moderates feel like they need to stand up to GOP leadership’s catering to conservatives now or else they’ll get steamrolled for the next two years…. Furthermore, there are potential cuts to defense spending as part of the deal with McCarthy’s opponents, which rankles hawks…. Social programs will get slashed by an ever bigger margin, maybe $100 billion or more.
