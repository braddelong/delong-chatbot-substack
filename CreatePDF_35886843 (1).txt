Ian Leslie: Biden's Bet: a€~Biden... is... hinting at... a€oel think theya€™re going to write about 
this point in historya€! about whether or not democracy can function in the 21st
century. Not a joke. Whether autocracy is the answea€”these were my debates Ia€™ d have in the many 
times I met with Xi.a€D... Biden believes that technology and science are
moving so fast that they pose an existential challenge to democracy itself. The consensus used to 
be that if China wanted to catch with the West it would have to democratisea€”
become more free, and more diverse, with power less centralised. But Xi has doubled down on 
autocracy and centralisation, partly by deploying new technologies. China is still
growing. For Biden, ita€™ s up to America to show the rest of the world that democracy is still the 
best platforma€!

Paragraphs:

Paul McLeary (2007): Is Perry Bacon Serious?: a€~Perry Bacon Jr. wrote what may be the single worst 
campaign a€~08 piece to appear in any American newspaper so far this
election cycle. In the front-page piece, Bacon muses over how the chances of Barack Obama getting 
elected president might be affected by the fact that hea€™ s not Muslim.

Seriously. To build his case, Bacon stumbles artlessly through all manner of rumor, innuendo, and 
xenophobic smeara€”never bothering to refute any of it, even though there is
plenty of well-documented evidence to knock down much of this stuff. Bacon kicks the whole sorry 
mess off with the unsubstantiated statement that: a€oeln his speeches and often
on the Internet, the part of Sen. Barack Obamaa€™ s biography that gets the most attention is not 
his race but his connections to the Muslim world.a€D Who, exactly, gives this the
most attention?a€! This habit of reporter sa€’’perpetuating untruths by writing stories about the 
a€cephenomenona€D of those untruthsa€’’drives us nuts. Was LexisNexis broken
in  the scant few minutes it must have taken him to write this story? If so, Bacon must have taken 
to Internet message boards to troll for xenophobic postsa€!. Bacon then wraps up
by tossing in a quote from an Obama adviser telling us that alla€™ s fine, therea€™ s nothing to 
worry about. Oh, well, with that tidbit at the end Bacon achieved the all-important
Balance, so alla€™ s well in newspaper-land.

Iskander Rehman: Metus Hostilis: Sallust, American Grand Strategy, & the Disciplining Effects of 
Peer Competition with China=: a€~Sallusta€™ s theory remains starkly
unforgiving, almost uncomfortably so, for a modern reader. As political scientist Daniel Kapust 
notes, this creates a dilemma whereby a€oethe coherence of a community may
become   linked to the existence of a dangerous foreign enemy.a€D Healthy democracies should be 
able to guarantee the conditions of their own success without fear of a great­
power competitor, and no sensible individual would argue in favor of cultivating foreign enmity for 
its own sake. And yet, Sallusta€™ s grim insights, however unsettling, may hold
some trutha€!. An unwelcome new strategic dispensation^! may paradoxically provide a clarifying and 
restorative sense of purpose to a deeply fractious American democracya€!.
Intense domestic polarization has rendered U.S. foreign policy more volatile, unpredictable 
anda€”in the eyes of international observersa€”unreliablea€!

Adam Ozimek: Future Workforce: a€~Companies continue to be remote: Nine months into the pandemic, 
41.8 percent of the American workforce remains fully remote.
Companies say remote work is getting easier, not harder, as time goes on: 68 percent of hiring 
managers say remote work is going more smoothly now than when their company
first   made the shift to at the start of the pandemic. Remote work will continue through 2021: 
Managers believe that 26.7 percent of the workforce will be fully remote in one year
suggesting that individuals will gradually continue to return to the office, but a significant 
share will remain remote in the near future. The number of remote workers in the next
five   years is expected to be nearly double what it was before COVIDa€“19: By 2025,36.2 million 
Americans will be remote, an increase of 16.8 million people from pre-pandemic
rates. Increased productivity and flexibility continue to be key benefits of remote work: Hiring 
managers cite reduction of non-essential meetings, increased schedule flexibility, and
no commute as aspects of remote work that have worked better than expecteda€!

Nancy Qian: The Two Sides of Chinese GDP: a€~In 2019a€! Chinaa€™ s per capita GDP in 2019 was 
$8,242, placing the country between Montenegro ($8,591) and Botswana
($8,093). Its per capita GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP) termsa€”with income adjusted to take 
account of the cost of livinga€”was $16,804a€! between Suriname ($17,256)
and Bosnia and Herzegovina ($16,289)a€!. GDP per capita in PPP terms in the US and the European 
Union is $65,298 and $47,828, respectivelya€!. Chinaa€™ s current level of
income inequalitya€! is similar to that found in the US and Indiaa€!. 600 million people havea€! an 
annual income of $l,860a€!. The Chinese government^! will be preoccupied
for   at least another generation by the need to increase domestic incomes. Buta€! governments can 
also bolster their popular support in ways that do not foster economic growtha€!
defendinga€! againsta€! earthquakes or the COVIDa€“19 pandemica€! territorial disputes in the South 
China Sea and along the Chinese-Indian bordera€!. The backlash effecta€!.
Many Chinese think the West is seeking to reassert political dominance and feel painful reminders 
of colonialism and World War IIa€!. Behind the worlda€™ s second-highest GDP
are hundreds of millions of people who just want to stop being poora€!

Jeet Heer: Can We Bring Back Blogging?: a€~The golden age of blogging wasa€! a digital party, where 
bouncing around through hyperlinks was always bringing in new writers
and new perspectivesa€! fresh voices and also of changing mindsa€!. The blogosphere opened up 
debate, especially in the 21st century revival of feminist, anti-racist, and socialist
politicsa€!. There were a lot of factors that led to the decline of blogginga€! adsa€! Google and 
Facebook ate up that revenue. Social media like Twitter and Facebook also
provided    a new way to micro-bloga€!. Ia€™ m still finding my sea legs as a Substacker. I want to 
know what works and what doesna€™ ta€!
