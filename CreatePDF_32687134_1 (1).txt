Alex Tolley: 2525: a€~There are 2 ways to create freshwatera€’’reverse osmosis, and evaporation. 
Reverse osmosis is teh preferred solution, forcing the water out through a membrane leaving the 
brine more salty behind. This is done by overcoming the osmotic pressurea€!. Evaporation is another
method that tends to be less effective but does have the advantage of using free solar energy in a 
deserta€!. The other issue is the transport of so much water. For California, it might mean 
hundreds of miles of pipes or waterways to distribute the water (uphill in some cases) to where it 
is needed,
adding  to the costa€!. he last problem is what to do with the saltier brinesa€!. In extremis, the 
desalination would have to replace all the water from the snowpack and winter rainfall, and at 
least some of that must keep the rivers and lakes supplied. And we havena€™ t even addresseda€! 
rising sea
level, salt intrusions into the aquifers, etc. due to all that energy usea€!. I dona€™ t see human 
nature and attitudes changing that much this century, at least not in the conservative San Joaquin 
Valley, which leads me to be somewhat pessimistic about future a€oewater warsa€D in the state that 
could
make todaya€™ s conflicts seem almost trivial.a€! LINK:

Happy to join in the ridicule of this. But perhaps worth recalling that almost every elected 
Republican, and almost every conservative movement leader, endorsed this man for re-election.

Statement by Donald J.
Trump, 45th President of the
United States of America

I hope everyone remembers when they’re getting
the COVID-19 (often referred to as the China Virus)
Vaccine, that if I wasn’t President, you wouldn’t be
getting that beautiful “shot” for 5 years, at best, and
probably wouldn’t be getting it at all. I hope
everyone remembers!

Paul Bouscasse, Emi Nakamura, & Jon Steinsson: When Did Growth Begin?: New Estimates of 
Productivity Growth in England from 1250 to 1870: a€~We provide new estimates of the evolution of 
productivity in England from 1250 to 1870. Real wages over this period were heavily influenced
by plague-induced swings in the population. We develop and implement a new methodology for 
estimating productivity that accounts for these Malthusian dynamics. In the early part of our 
sample, we find that productivity growth was zero. Productivity growth began in 1600a€’’almost a 
century
before the Glorious Revolution. Posta€“1600 productivity growth had two phases: an initial phase of 
modest growth of 4% per decade between 1600 and 1810, followed by a rapid acceleration at the time 
of the Industrial Revolution to 18% per decade. Our evidence helps distinguish between
theories                                                                                            
                                            of why growth began. In particular, our findings 
support the idea that broad-based economic change preceded the bourgeois institutional reforms of 
17th century England and may have contributed to causing them. We also estimate the strength of 
Malthusian population forces on real wages.
We find that these forces were sufficiently weak to be easily overwhelmed by posta€“1800

wars of tolerance were the religious wars which tore through Europe between 1524 and 1648a€l.

does not violate its moral principles; it is fundamental to them, because without this enforcement, 
the treaty
would collapse. It is appropriate, even ethical, to answer force with proportional force, when that

Enrique Dans: Twelve Things Ia€™ ve Learned After A Year Of Video Conferencing: a€~Zoom is by far 
the besta€!. Virtualize your camera: regardless of the software you use, virtualize your camera. 
Always. Ita€™ s probably what makes the biggest difference. My absolute recommendation is
mmhmma€!. Good lighting is keya€!. Dona€™t share your screen: when making a presentation, screen 
sharing is almost always the worst option, except in some specific cases (use of spreadsheets, 
etc.) Instead, share your presentations using the virtual camera, or use the virtual backgrounds to
locate your presentation. This will give you more presentation options, you will be seen at all 
times at a reasonable size, and you will communicate better, more stronglya€!. Ration your calls : 
Video conferencing is tiringa€!. Youa€! need to feel comfortable in an environment that is already 
the
norma€!. It costs very little to project a professional image, and that the effect is very 
noticeablea€!

John Maynard Keynes: The Choice of Units: a€~Our quantitative analysis must be expressed without 
using any quantitatively vague expressions. And, indeed, as soon as one makes the attempt, it 
becomes clear, as I hope to show, that one can get on much better without thema€!. Thata€!
incommensurable collections of miscellaneous objects cannot in themselves provide the material for 
a quantitative analysis need nota€! prevent us from making approximate statistical comparisons, 
depending on some broad element of judgmenta€! which may possess significance and validity
within   certain limits. But the proper place for such things as net real output and the general 
level of prices lies within the field of historical and statistical description, and their purpose 
should be to satisfy historical or social curiositya€!. To say that net output to-day is greater, 
but the price-level
lower, than ten years ago or one year ago, is a proposition of a similar character to the statement 
that Queen Victoria was a better queen but not a happier woman than Queen Elizabetha€”a proposition 
not without meaning and not without interest, but unsuitable as material for the differential
calculus. Our precision will be a mock precision if we try to use such partly vague and 
non-quantitative concepts as the basis of a quantitative analysisa€! LINK:

Michael Kremer, Jack Willis, & Yang You: Converging to Convergence <https://github 
.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/readings/article-kremer-convergence .pdf>: a€~Empirical 
tests of convergence in the 1990s found that con- ditioning on institutions mattered: 
unconditionally, the norm
was divergence, if anything. We revisit these tests with 20 years of additional data. While the 
literature on institutions emphasizes their historical origins and persistence, we find substantial 
changes. First, there has been a trend towards unconditional convergence since the 1960s, leading to
convergence since the early 2000s. Second, policies and institutions have converged substantially, 
towards development-favored institutions - those associated, across countries, with higher levels 
of in- come. Third, the institutional changes are larger, on average, than those predicted by the 
cross-
sectional income-institution slope; while the slope itself has remained stable. Fourth, the 
growth-institution slope - the coefficients of growth regressions - has decreased substantially, 
resulting in a shrinking in the gap between conditional and unconditional convergence. We discuss 
the implications

of these new patterns for models of growtha€! ALREADY POSTED TO BRIEFLY NOTED
