It does not tend to erode the free speech community. And while some might call him indecent in using hyperbole in calling Israel today an apartheid state, I certainly would not—although I would say that that hyperbole is not likely to be a constructive contribution. So I see absolutely zero case for fellowship denial. (And I thought the administrative denial of a fellowship to Chelses Manning was extremely dismaying as well.</p><p>That said, I cannot sign on to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1JWMaHU3dssdMAQEWJRlqKMpm4F6QHQWN_mNUkW2liLQ/mobilebasic?urp=gmail_link">Open letter to Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas Elmendorf, Harvard President Lawrence Bacow, and Incoming Harvard President Claudine Gay</a>. To claim that “welcoming Ehud Barak and Tzipi Livni” is part of “a long history of anti-Palestinian bias, discrimination, and racism at the Harvard Kennedy School” is not a statement that anyone who wants to contribute to a free-speech or an academic culture can make.</p><p>But do not take the absence of my signature from the letter as evidence that I am not significantly dismayed.</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:94919154,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://popehat.substack.com/p/hamline-university-and-cancel-culture&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:86716,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Popehat Report&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d6d0f415-4618-48a1-883f-f5c2087af66c_240x240.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Hamline University And Cancel Culture&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Last March I wrote a self-indulgently long post airing my grievances about the term “cancel culture” and how it’s used in an unprincipled, unproductive way that discourages good discussions rather than encouraging them.

I think my assessment is going to be something like this: <em><strong>an occasionally hallucinatory conventional-wisdom generator</strong></em><strong>.</strong> </p><p>After all, what else could it possibly be? Chat-GPT looks back at up to 4000 tokens (maybe 3000 words?) in the prompt(s), and then, probabilistically, it selects the next token to output. It was trained on half a trillion words, and it has 175 billion connection weights between nodes. And yet how it is wired together is not obvious to me, and it is not obvious why its wiring is the right wiring for us to be trying to build. It seems to me to be too word-cloudy to be likely to be successful. But, then, I also think that most oral and written communication is too word-cloudy to be well-designed for its purposes.</p><p>The worrisome thing is that what has made it viral is that it speaks with much too much authority, it is too convincing at conveying the false illusion that there is actually a human mind back there. And that is likely to mislead us.</p><p>For example, I fed it <em><strong>the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy</strong></em>. Its response was not “dog”, period, followed by something else. Its response was:</p><blockquote><p>The phrase "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy" is a well-known sentence that is used to test the quality of typefaces. The sentence uses every letter of the English alphabet, making it a good sentence to test the completeness of a typeface. The sentence is also commonly used as a typing test and as a sentence that can be used to test the autocomplete function of a word processing program.</p></blockquote><ol><li><p>This is wrong. </p></li><li><p>“The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy” is not a sentence. </p></li><li><p>“The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy” is not well-known. </p></li><li><p>“The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy” is not used to test the quality of typefaces. </p></li><li><p>All of those are true not of the prompt, but rather of “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.”</p></li><li><p>What is right is that “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy” can be used to test the autocomplete function of a world processing program. </p></li></ol><p>Do note that, as autocomplete, Chat-GPT has just flunked.</p><p>It is pretty clear to me what Chat-GPT did here: It thought:</p><ul><li><p>“The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy” is almost the same as “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog”.</p></li><li><p>So I will say the things that usually follow ““The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog”.</p></li><li><p>There are some occurrences of “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy” which are then soon followed by “test the autocomplete function” and “word processing program”.</p></li><li><p>So I will output that as well.</p></li></ul><p>No, the issue is complicated by the fact that a lot of the time—95%?—hen we speak or write, we are stochastic parrots giving the conventional or conventional wisdom tokens in response to a prompt. But there is that very meaningful extra 5%. That is what GPT-Chat lacks.</p><p>Perhaps what we are learning is (a) how much of language is social, reinforcement, blue rather than information, transmission, and (b) how much of language it is information transmission is, indeed, the transmission of useful and relatively straightforward conventional wisdom that Chat-GPT can grok by essentially averaging the corpus of human language instances? Perhaps not. Perhaps I am off base here…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>MUST-READ: Sell þe Bonds!</h2><p>Selling bonds for more than par is less stupid and less goofy than “disinvesting” the Social Security trust fund and then claiming that the trust fund balance is not part of the debt subject to limit.

And… stupid in a manner that is perfectly suitable to the underlying stupidity of the statutory debt ceiling, which purports to limit the face value of debt that the Treasury can issue separate from all the legislation that specifies how much money the Treasury has to spend…</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/chat-gpt-what-is-it-good-for-and/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/chat-gpt-what-is-it-good-for-and/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>ONE IMAGE: A little inflation is a much better problem to have þan an economy depressed for a decade:</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F197b0fc7-0e0d-424c-905f-750d8eb6b527_1474x798.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F197b0fc7-0e0d-424c-905f-750d8eb6b527_1474x798.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F197b0fc7-0e0d-424c-905f-750d8eb6b527_1474x798.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F197b0fc7-0e0d-424c-905f-750d8eb6b527_1474x798.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F197b0fc7-0e0d-424c-905f-750d8eb6b527_1474x798.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/197b0fc7-0e0d-424c-905f-750d8eb6b527_1474x798.png" width="1456" height="788" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/197b0fc7-0e0d-424c-905f-750d8eb6b527_1474x798.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:788,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:104030,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F197b0fc7-0e0d-424c-905f-750d8eb6b527_1474x798.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F197b0fc7-0e0d-424c-905f-750d8eb6b527_1474x798.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F197b0fc7-0e0d-424c-905f-750d8eb6b527_1474x798.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F197b0fc7-0e0d-424c-905f-750d8eb6b527_1474x798.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://substack.com/refer/braddelong?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_context=post&amp;utm_content=undefined&amp;utm_campaign=writer_referral_button&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Start a Substack&quot;}"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Start writing today.

I can read the Fed’s credibility with the bond market off of the numbers. The Fed has immense credibility as an inflation fighter with the bond market. And the consequences for being at the zero lower bound, and thus having the market rate of interest well-above the neutral rate are immense—not just economic consequences, but eroding democracy, and aiding rising fascism as well. So where does all this come from?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ragu Rajan: </strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/86275542-fe94-4f4e-ab0b-c7325ba7fa4b">Central banks can’t win when it comes to credibility on inflation</a>: ‘Institutions are scrambling to rebuild their toolkits to deal with the new regime: The kind of credibility needed to escape a regime of overly low inflation, which we had until recently, is different from the kind needed to curb high inflation, which we have now. And by its very nature, credibility does not turn on a dime…. Should the Fed work once more to regain credibility as an inflation hawk? Credibility takes a long time to build, and inflation regimes could switch again…. [But] central banks will probably be most effective if they rebuild their commitment to combating high inflation. And if inflation falls too low, perhaps we should learn to live with it…</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>How is it that Poland and Malaysia have managed to successfully utilize FDI for growth in ways that other countries have not?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Noah Smith: </strong><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-polandmalaysia-model?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">The Poland/Malaysia model</a>: ‘The richer you get, the harder it is to grow, so by reaching the ~$30,000 range, Poland and Malaysia have accomplished an impressive feat… not <em>quite</em> as impressive as South Korea, but then again, who is?… They relied heavily on <strong>foreign direct investment</strong>…. Poland and Malaysia are both very export-intensive economies—as much or more so than South Korea…. Ha-Joon Chang and some other industrial policy fans think that FDI is not the basis of a sound development strategy….

Reporters who are flattered as peers by government officials willing to cut corners, and tell lies are than willing to go the extra mile to excuse such a government officials. I assure you that Cap Weinberger did not look at Richard Cohen as a “basic sort of guy” and a sort-of peer, but as a mark:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Richard Cohen</strong> (1992)<strong>: </strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1992/12/30/without-candor/f76b0478-9bdf-4c85-95cd-8f0c9340a45c/">Without C</a>andor: ‘Back when Caspar Weinberger was secretary of defense, he and I used to meet all the time.

I tell you this about the man President Bush just pardoned because it always influenced my opinion of Weinberger.... Based on my Safeway encounters, I came to think of Weinberger as a basic sort of guy, candid and no nonsense—which is the way much of official Washington saw him. It seemed somehow cruel that he should end his career—he's 75—either as a defendant in a criminal case or as a felon. The man deserved better than that.... He may have lost his good sense when he allegedly withheld evidence. That being said, I was pleased when he was pardoned...</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Kevin McCarthy plays Jim Fallows.

But if you’d listened to the… general GOP rhetoric of the era, you’d notice the things McCarthy did not say… “stolen” election… “socialists”…  Hunter Biden… [no] saber-rattl[ing] about raising the debt ceiling… not use “Democrat” as an adjective (rather than “Democratic”), in the routinely insulting way pioneered by Newt Gingrich… did not disparage the man who gave him the gavel, Hakeem Jeffries….
