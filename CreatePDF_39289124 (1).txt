rad DeLong: Chinaa€™ s Likely Trajectory in Xi Jinpinga€™ s Third Term, &\ a€~FIRST: Chinaa€™ s 
Likely Trajectory in Xi Jinpinga€™ s Third Term
The Economist joins those who think that Xi Jinpinga€™ s policies are not sidestepping but instead 
falling deeper into the middle-income trap:

The Economist: How Xi Jinping Is Damaging Chinaa€™ s Economy: a€~Inflexible policies are trumping 
pragmatisma€!. Ideological zeal is behinda€! economic initiatives that form what Mr Xi calls his 
a€oenew development concepta€D, which is meant to address a€oegreat changes unseen in a 
centurya€da€! to tackle inequality, monopolies and debt, and to
ensure that China dominates new technologies and is fortified against Western sanctions.

Yet in all cases Mr Xi believes the party must take the lead, and implementation has been punitive 
and erratic. A blizzard of fines, new regulations and purgesa€!. A savage but incomplete crackdown 
on the property sector, responsible for over a fifth of gdp, has led to a funding cruncha€”one 
reason why housing sales fell by 47% in April compared with a year
earliera€!. Xia€™ s economic modela€! involves expanding the scope of the least productive part of 
the economy: the government-run one.

Chinaa€™ s industrial policy has had formidable successes, for example building a dominant global 
position in advanced batteries. Mr Xi hopes that technology and a new cohort of state investment 
funds will make decision-making more agile. But dona€™ t forget all the dismal failures, from 
rust-belt industries to microchipsa€!. To the extent it can be discerned
from the black box of elite politics, there is no rival to Mr Xi, who is 68. Yet in the run-up to a 
party congress that may see him secure power until at least 2027, the shortcomings of one-man rule 
in the worlda€™ s second-largest economy are glaringa€!

It is the fact that I have been wrongly pessimistic about Chinaa€™ s growth in the pasta€”and 
wrongly optimistic about its politicsa€”that gives me pause here. Right now I am very pessimistic 
about Chinaa€™ s politics and pessimistic about Chinaa€™ s economics. I think there is a very good 
chance that it is caught in a middle income trap. But the track record
tells me that I really should not believe myself. Who should I believe instead?

As I see it, there are ten important aspects of the situation right now:

Chinaa€™ s growth has created three Chinasa€”the Spain-level 60-million megacity growth poles, 
which also possess the worlda€™ s second-leading high-tech economy; the Poland-level 300-million 
coastal economy, which is the worlda€™ s largest export manufacturing mechine ever (and which is 
mostly integrated with the rest of the world much more than with
Chinaa€™ s interior), and the Peru-level one-billion interior economy, whose performance has been 
very good by global-south standards but sub-par by Pacific Rim standards. All-in-all, 
Chinaa€’’coastal Chinaa€”has managed to grow about as fast as one would expect given (i) when it 
started its reform process, and (ii) that it is located on the Pacific Rim. China
managed to grow at a near-Pacific Rim pace by stepping away from really-existing socialism-style 
planning and implementing a market economy. A near-Pacific Rim pace: while coastal China has 
matched, the IB people of poor Chinaa€’’although they have done very wella€”have not. Thus the 
Chinese government will be focusing on trying to make poor China
richa€”and on playing the nationalism carda€”for the next generation. China accomplished this in 
seven stages: (i) rural de-communization, (ii) growth of TVEs, (hi) urban retail decontrol, (iv) 
successfully dismantling the SOEs, (v) the great rural interior-urban coast migration, (vi) housing 
privatization, and (vii) the WTO-undervalued RMB-export manufacturing
push. This was not at all easy. Other countries that attempted to transition to a market 
economya€”to a€cestep away from the plana€Ela€”suffered a decade-long depression, underwent 
enormous political turmoil, and ended with a system that was substantially dysfunctional both in 
its political and its economic aspects. China managed it. Starting in 2010, China
moves its management of the coast away from mere decontrol and toward focusing investment and 
growth on a€cestrategica€D priorities It tries a€celeapfroga€D: trying to get in on the ground 
floor with the development of a new a€oeGeneral Purpose TechnologyaCD cluster: networks and data 
and AIa€’’Innovation-Driven Development Strategy It faces
a€oeweaponized interdependencea€D and a perceived declaration of technological war against China, 
to which China is now responding. What does the Chinese government think that it is doing?

It is still pursuing what it calls a€oesocialism with Chinese characteristicsa€D, but which those 
of us interested in calling things by their right names call: authoritarian state surveillance 
capitalism with egalitarian aspirations. The Chinese government thinks: we have nothing to learn 
from the United Statesa€”GFC, Great Recession, anemic recovery, Trump,
disinformation epidemic, coronavirus: it is a society in decline, living off of accumulated 
capital. Therefore we need to break away from it. The purpose of the export machine is not to slot 
ourselves into the export-machine slot in the global division of labor. The purpose of our export 
machine is to attain technological parity. And after that, our societal superiority will
lead    to technological supremacy. And after that, the CCP will lead humanity forward into the 
sunlit uplands of utopia.

What form will a€ceutopiaa€D take in the eyes of Xi Jinping and his successors? Well, they are 
certain that the CCP can only be the vanguard of humanity if the CCP is more than a bunch of 
corrupt bureaucrats uneasily sitting atop the pyramid of society. So:

• Use propaganda to create centralized campaigns of inspiration.


• Recall tne CCF to its egalitarian, utopian origins.

• Repress those who seek to remove the CCP from its vanguard rolea€”that way lies decadence and 
incompetence, like the United States today.

The problem is that the CCP is, increasingly, a bunch of corrupt bureaucrats uneasily sitting atop 
the pyramid of society. So I really cannot see how it could end well.a€!
