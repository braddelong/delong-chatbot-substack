Put the one side are we manage ourselves in the realm of thought. How do we manage ourselves in the realm of work and production? Or, rather, how does each of us try to tune our by-now extremely sophisticated and fine division of labor so that we can accomplish our own purposes?</p><p>Well, basically, there are three ways that we can appropriate for ourselves things out of the common pool created by our extremely sophisticated division of labor in production and work. We can do so by force, by fraud, or by win-win exchange. Which of those we choose is determined by how much we regard ourselves as invested in the well-being of others, how much effort each of these modes of action is for us, and how valuable is the work of those whose efforts we are trying to control and appropriate. When something becomes or when someone’s work becomes more valuable, it is worth more of our energy to appropriate—and this can either be good or bad for those who make all the valuable things, depending:</p><blockquote><p><strong>James Davis Nicoll</strong>: <em>Five SFF Books in Which Valuable Is Not the Same as Powerful</em>: ‘The use of the word “commodity” underlines an unfortunate truth: valuable is not the same as powerful. One might think a particular class of person having a monopoly on an economically vital activity would make them powerful. No—it makes whoever controls them powerful. A quick glance at history shows many, many cases where considerable force was used to compel useful people to perform necessary services for little to no reward, from manual labour to reproduction. Perhaps SPI’s background, were it to be further detailed, would show powerful women dominating galactic politics…but it’s just as likely that telesthetic women are traded, controlled, and denied personal autonomy. Perhaps some fictional examples are in order…. <em>Red Moon and Black Mountain</em> by Joy Chant (1970)…. Wild Seed by Octavia E.

In the footnotes, they explain that they receive data that has been de-identified for privacy purposes, and consequently, you may be reported to them as two separate individuals if you get different doses from different providers. They also explain that not everyone has county of residence information, which is why the county-level counts aggregate up to a lower number than the state-level count. Then, in a methodological choice that I think was a mistake, they top code everything at 99.9% on the theory that “this cap helps address potential overestimates of vaccination coverage due to first, second, and booster doses that were not linked.” This top-coding lets the CDC avoid saying absurd things like 117% of the senior citizens in Montgomery County are vaccinated.

But as David Wallace-Wells pointed out, the official data actually “suggested in some places considerably more than 100 percent of local residents were vaccinated there, in some cases 200 percent of local residents.” Smart people on the internet swiftly reached a consensus that this reflected the miscounting of seasonal residents or vaccine tourists. After all, before Ron DeSantis’ political instincts led him to his current quasi-anti-vax posture, he was an early advocate of a more open, less bureaucratic approach to vaccine allocation.

It is possible to make a living, even to be quite successful and gain a degree of fame or intellectual legitimacy and recognition in mediums like podcasts and newsletters, but the threat of irrelevance and obscurity hangs over the cultural producer and the need to publicize, to reach new publics and markets is ever-present…. Being involved in some public outrage is a very quick and effective form of publicity…. This connection between journalism, theatricality, and cultural politics feels very familiar to me from reading about the 19th and 20th century…. I recently recommended Philip Nord’s <em>The Politics of Resentment: Shopkeeper Protest in Nineteenth-Century Paris</em> and his description of the dynamics of the literary culture of the Third Republic feels apposite…. It is surely possible for someone to find something louche and romantic in all this, or to find in this some kind of revolt or radicalism, but to any clearsighted observer, it’s all pretty dingy…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:44987552,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://johnganz.substack.com/p/the-political-economy-of-reaction&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:112019,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Unpopular Front&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e2ad597-1a1e-4c5b-be30-d37b49502770_1224x1224.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Political Economy of Reaction &quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;“Theories and schools, like microbes and globules, devour each other and by their struggle ensure the continuing of life.”—Marcel Proust, Sodom and Gomorrah “Literary men exist not by the preservation, but by the destruction of their own species.”—William Hazlitt&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2021-12-04T18:04:04.425Z&quot;,&quot;like_count&quot;:42,&quot;comment_count&quot;:15,&quot;bylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:4290781,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;John Ganz&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/47e00cdc-384d-4c88-b915-9d55ac79f36a_400x400.jpeg&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;trying to write\n&quot;,&quot;profile_set_up_at&quot;:&quot;2021-04-21T22:36:29.207Z&quot;,&quot;publicationUsers&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:244418,&quot;user_id&quot;:4290781,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;admin&quot;,&quot;public&quot;:true,&quot;is_primary&quot;:false,&quot;publication&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:112019,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Unpopular Front&quot;,&quot;subdomain&quot;:&quot;johnganz&quot;,&quot;custom_domain&quot;:null,&quot;custom_domain_optional&quot;:false,&quot;hero_text&quot;:&quot;the junk shop of history &quot;,&quot;logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e2ad597-1a1e-4c5b-be30-d37b49502770_1224x1224.png&quot;,&quot;author_id&quot;:4290781,&quot;theme_var_background_pop&quot;:&quot;#2096FF&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2020-10-14T13:56:35.952Z&quot;,&quot;rss_website_url&quot;:null,&quot;email_from_name&quot;:null,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;John Ganz&quot;,&quot;founding_plan_name&quot;:&quot;Founding Member&quot;,&quot;community_enabled&quot;:true,&quot;invite_only&quot;:false}}],&quot;twitter_screen_name&quot;:&quot;lionel_trolling&quot;,&quot;is_guest&quot;:false}],&quot;utm_campaign&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:null}"><a class="embedded-post" native="true" href="https://johnganz.substack.com/p/the-political-economy-of-reaction?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web"><div class="embedded-post-header"><img class="embedded-post-publication-logo" src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e2ad597-1a1e-4c5b-be30-d37b49502770_1224x1224.png" loading="lazy"><span class="embedded-post-publication-name">Unpopular Front</span></div><div class="embedded-post-title-wrapper"><div class="embedded-post-title">The Political Economy of Reaction </div></div><div class="embedded-post-body">“Theories and schools, like microbes and globules, devour each other and by their struggle ensure the continuing of life.”—Marcel Proust, Sodom and Gomorrah “Literary men exist not by the preservation, but by the destruction of their own species.”—William Hazlitt…</div><div class="embedded-post-cta-wrapper"><span class="embedded-post-cta">Read more</span></div><div class="embedded-post-meta">a year ago · 42 likes · 15 comments · John Ganz</div></a></div><div><hr></div><p><strong>Timothy Snyder</strong>: <em>Lesson 12: Make Eye Contact &amp; Small Talk</em>: ‘This is the one that has aroused the most comment over the years.
