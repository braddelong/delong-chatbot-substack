Let us raise the curtain on the French Chamber of Deputies, soon after the inauguration of Léon Blum as Prime Minister. We give the mic to France’s right-wing future Nazi collaborators, as reported by William L. Shirer:</p><blockquote><p><strong>William L. Shirer</strong> (1969): <em>The Collapse of the Third Republic: An Inquiry into the Fall of France, 1940</em> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster): ‘At the opening session of the new Chamber a rightist deputy, Xavier-Vallat, taunted the Premier for his Jewishness:</p><blockquote><p>XAVIER-VALLAT: Your arrival in office, Mr. President, is incontestably a historic date. For the first time this ancient Gallic-Roman country will be governed— </p><p>HERRIOT (the Speaker): Be careful what you say, M. Vallat! </p><p>XAVIER-VALLAT:—by a Jew. I have to say aloud what everyone is thinking silently—that to govern this peasant nation which is France it is better to have someone whose origins, no matter how modest, spring from the womb of our soil rather than have a subtle Talmudist… </p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>And he warned that the country would now be run by “a small Jewish coterie.” Blum for a moment was beside himself with rage but before he could respond Herriot censored Xavier-Vallat and declared the incident closed. For the reactionary press, however, it was just a beginning.</p><p>In <em>L’Action Française</em>, Maurras and Daudet had a field day. “France under the Jew” was the title of Maurras’ first editorial the day after Blum took office. “We now have a Jewish government,” he warned his readers. </p><p>Daudet excelled him in inventing insulting titles for the new Premier: “Blum, the gentle yid,” “the radiophonie Hebrew,” who presided over the “Cretin-Talmud cabinet.” France, said Daudet, had returned to the times of </p><blockquote><p>the traitor Alfred Dreyfus. The domination of a rabbinical Jew, Léon Blum, a total stranger to our manners, customs, and ways of understanding and feeling, multiplies the peril of war by ten times...</p></blockquote><p>Previously the Right had assaulted Blum for his pacifism. Now it cried out that because of his hatred of Fascism he would lead the country into war against Italy and Germany. <em>L’Action Française</em> harped on the fear. “It is as a Jew that Blum must be seen, conceived, understood, fought and brought down,” wrote Maurras. “This last verb may seem a little strong. I hasten to say I do not mean that Blum must be beaten down physically—until that day when his policies lead us into the war which he dreams of waging against our Italian friends. That day we must not fail to do so.” </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Gleefully Maurras quoted some lines that André Gide, whose literary fame in the thirties had become enormous and who in 1936 was just abandoning a naive faith in Communism, had written in 1914: that Blum was “too Jewish” for his own good. </p><blockquote><p>It comes [Gide had written] from the fact that Blum considers the Jewish race superior, as called upon to dominate after having been long dominated, and that it is his duty to work for its triumph with all his force. Doubtlessly he foresees the possible advent of the race…. He seems to think that the time will come which will be the time of the Jews…</p></blockquote><p>Quickly on June 5, the day after Blum took office, Gide hastened to explain that what he really meant to say in 1914 was that the Jews had a passion for justice and the truth and it was that which “animated” Blum. He was extremely happy, he added, at the triumph of the Popular Front in general and of Blum in particular. Under such leadership, he was sure, France would resume its role as a “pioneer of civilization.” </p><p>The Right complained that Blum had stacked his government with Jews. Henri Béraud in the anti-Semitic and Fascist-oriented weekly <em>Gringoire</em> named thirty-two Jews who, he said, had been given prominent posts in the ministries, including one by the name of Dreyfus. Even Pertinax (André Géraud), the influential press commentator on foreign affairs, would complain later that Blum had unnecessarily courted anti-Semitism “by surrounding himself in the Premier’s office by ten, if not more, Jews.” Actually only two Jews held prominent posts in that office: André Blumel, a former law-partner of Blum, and Jules Moch, a young naval engineer. Blum himself was the only Jew among the ministers…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/collapseofthird00will/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/collapseofthird00will/mode/2up</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Nowadays, the very tight identity between hated Jews (hated as a religiously-despised other) and “rootless cosmopolites” (hated… as eroders of the hierarchical ethnic-centered community) is a lot less tight than it used to be. It used to be very tight indeed: Karl Marx, in his early writings, used “Jewishness” in the place in his argument where he later chose “bourgeois”. But the underlying pressures are similar.</p><p>History rhyming: America today as a mirrored version of the French Late Third Republic… The French Third Republic faced a very sharp existential threat from its external enemy Nazi Germany and its internal enemies Philippe Petain and Pierre Lavall and their faction, which it did not survive. America faces no equivalent combination amounting to an existential threat—yet.</p><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/the-right-wing-war-against-rootless?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thank you for reading Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality.

That is a big responsibility with enormous social consequences, and in the U.S. that sort of responsibility generally gets put on a bankruptcy court.

But at least in theory, the case for representative democracy is strong. Political decisions really matter. They should be made well. But they are hard. Whatever interests and values you hold dear, it takes a lot of work to inform and educate yourself…. The genius, in theory, of representative democracy is that voters hire specialists to do the information work for them. In a representative democracy, it is not really your job as an ordinary citizen to have a strong view about the details that actually get legislated…. [But] modern representative democracy is simply a system whose predictable result is governance by competing coalitions of insiders, who develop deep relationships and thick connections to one another, while the electorate they notionally serve becomes an inchoate, threatening demon that must be flattered and appeased…. Direct democracy enfranchises the citizenry to decide upon matters of whose details and ramifications they are rationally ignorant, with predictably imperfect results…. But what if… we self-affiliated into groups of common interest of no more than, say, 1000 souls, for whom personal, physical “town meetings” could be regularly arranged?… Instead of a few hundred Congresspeople, we’d have 250,000 representatives whose full-time job it would be to stay and live among and interact with their constituents, and participate in the online legislature…. The hard part of being a representative is representing. The problem we should devote ourselves to is the challenge of making one person’s voice become a capable stand-in for many others’ necessarily absent…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9069.html">https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/9069.html</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Peter Andre, Ingar Haaland, Chris Roth, &amp; Johannes Wohlfart</strong>: <em>Inflation Narratives</em>: ‘Inflation has recently surged in both the US and the EU.

Wood’s compact definition of Web3, as he put it in a recent Wired interview, is simple: “Less trust, more truth.”… The Ethereum community’s early writings on the topic offer measured assessments of the trade-offs and challenges ahead for Web3, but most popular accounts today are suffused with hype and the glamor of financial speculation…. Yes, exchanges like Coinbase are making a lot of money, but unlike traditional financial exchanges, what’s being traded isn’t general-purpose money but a speculative asset class that may be wildly overvalued. Nor has blockchain replaced trust in the way that Gavin Wood hoped….
