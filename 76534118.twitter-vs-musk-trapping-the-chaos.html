This cultural shift has been most thoroughly documented by political scientist <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E3UR8LC/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">Ronald Inglehart</a> in a long-running series of World Values Surveys…. Although consumer capitalism continues to raise material living standards, it has not been very effective at satisfying those higher, spiritual needs whose fulfillment defines a high quality of life. It does well enough for the well-educated professional and managerial elite—roughly the top 25 percent in contemporary rich democracies. Which is no mean accomplishment: never before in history has such a large fraction of society lived so well. For these people, their working lives are sufficiently interesting, challenging, and financially rewarding to be well worth all the associated rigors and stresses. But outside this golden circle, delineated these days primarily by educational credentials, things are different…. Yet what has unfolded in societies liberated from physical want falls far short of widespread individual flourishing. The progressive disintegration of family and community life is most severe among the less educated. Where once workplace solidarity and tight-knit social relationships were compensations for lower economic standing, now the new class divide leaves those outside the elite increasingly atomized and adrift…. Here then is the crux of the problem. Capitalism has roused us to elevate new values to the position of primary concern, but has failed to supply conditions consistent with achieving them. This is the classic situation that gives rise to revolutions and the collapse of established social orders: rising expectations without the means to fulfill them. This, in my view, is what’s provoking our “general nervous breakdown”…</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:75373037,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://brinklindsey.substack.com/p/what-is-the-permanent-problem&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:1096044,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Permanent Problem&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a735eaa5-5f1a-40c9-83cd-5450e69a0dc7_278x278.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;What Is the Permanent Problem?&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Since 2016, I’ve done a great deal of reading, writing, thinking, talking, and brooding about the crisis of liberal democracy we’re now living through — how it originated, what powers it, and how possibly to defuse it or at least muddle through it.

The appointment of his wife and former mistress as the American ambassador to the Holy See by Trump wasn’t just a disgrace, it was disgusting. There are few Americans who have done more to damage American unity and harm the American spirit than the self-declared “world historical figure.” He led the impeachment of a president in one of the greatest abuses of power and hypocrisy in American political history.

But my understanding is that the popularity of these reforms varies quite a bit from idea to idea, so it’s worth understanding which risks are worth running and which aren’t. Overall, though, I think the future is bright. Ten years ago, housing reform was considered a bizarre niche issue that nobody in the audience cared about and where change was politically impossible.
