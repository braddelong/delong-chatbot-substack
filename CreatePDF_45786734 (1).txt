Omicron is here. Time to hunker down until it becomes clear that this is a lower-mortality virus. 
Or, if not, we are going to lose 20% of our unhunkered unvaccinated over 80s, 10% of our unhunkered 
unvaccinated over 70-80s, and 4% of our unhunkered unvaccinated 60-70s in the next two months:

Nsikan Akpan: a€™ Welp, that escalated quickly. Omicron now makes up 92% of sequenced cases in the 
New York and New Jersey region, based on the latest data from the CDC. Thata€™ s up from the 13% 
reported last week. Nationally, omicron is 73%, up from 12% reported last week 
<https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-
tracker/#variant-proportions>. But even if the severity profile holds true and omicron is mostly 
mild for people with immunity, a sh*t ton of unvaccinated people could still be in trouble because 
society is fully mixing. Hospitals are saying they can handle the coming surge despite fatigue 
among HCWsa€l. But unvaxxed adults
who       have not been previously exposed (and there are a lot of you), the time has arrived to 
get vaxxed or literally take every precaution you can to not catch omicron. By doing so, you can 
also help protect unvaxxed kidsa€l

Abstract


We estimate the effect of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion on county­
level mortality in the first four years following expansion using restricted-access
microdata covering all deaths in the United States. To adjust for pre-expansion
differences   in mortality rates between treatment and control, we use a propensity­
score weighting model together with techniques from machine learning to match
counties in expansion and non-expansion states. We find a reduction in all-cause
mortality in ages 20 to 64 equaling 11.36 deaths per 100,000 individuals, a 3.6
percent decrease. This estimate is largely driven by reductions in mortality in
counties  with higher pre-expansion uninsured rates and for causes of death likely to
be influenced by access to healthcare. A cost-benefit analysis show's that the
improvement in welfare due to mortality responses may offset the entire net-of-
transfers expenditure associated with the expansion.

Scott Lemieux: John Roberts Took Live-Saving Insurance Away from People Based on an Argument He 
Didna€™ t Believe to Inflict Political Damage on Barack Obama: a€~It seems very bad, to me, that 
the Supreme Court re-wrote the revisions of a program that had already been revised many times to 
make it much easier for states not to take the
expansion, based on a nonsensical application of a doctrine that has not been used to restrict 
federal spending before or since. And whata€™ s even worse is that the swing vote heard these 
arguments (perfunctory throwaways that were an afterthought even for the Federalist Society 
Industrial Complex) at oral argument and rejected them, but decided to
revive them in the name of the real doctrine behind his decision, a€oewe must do something to 
damage OBAMACARE and this is something.a€D This is a ridiculous way for an alleged judicial body to 
proceed in any context, let alone a literal life-or-death one. But because he didna€™t accept the 
most extreme form of the anti-ACA argument
Roberts  will never get more than a tiny fraction of the criticism he deserves for have done 
thisa€!

Rana Foroohar: The Lessons for the US from Chinaa€™ s a€~Common Prosperitya€™ Push: a€~The Chinese 
Communist party has been on something of a charm campaign in the US. Amid all the stories about a 
silenced tennis star, a #MeToo scandal, disappeared billionaires and Uyghur concentration camps, 
Americans are also beginning to hear
about Beijinga€™ s efforts to reduce inequality and create a healthier and more balanced type of 
economic growtha€!. There are nonetheless important lessons that America should takea€! the focus
