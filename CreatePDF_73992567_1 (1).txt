Michael Hiltzik: Column: How did America get addicted to a policy that fails everyone but the rich?

The neoliberalism of Ronald Reagan has served only the rich, yet it still governs American economic 
policy. UC Berkeleya€™ s Brad DeLong examines why in his new book:
Social Democratic policies crafted in the 1930s succeeded in creating a long era of widespread 
prosperity, then suddenly lost their credibility in the mid-1970s. They were replaced
by the neoliberalism of Ronald Reagan, which failed to help anyone but the rich, yet still governs 
American economic policy. The ascent of neoliberalism and its staying power
a€oeis a puzzle ,a€D J. Bradford DeLong writes in his magisterial new economic history of the 20th 
century, a€oeSlouching Towards Utopia.a€D Ita€™ s the central puzzle that
DeLong, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, a widely followed economics blogger and one of our 
leading critics of economic inequality, aims to examine. DeLong takes as
the canvas what he calls the a€oelong twentieth century ,a€D which he defines as the period from 
1870 to 2010 and argues was a€oethe most consequential years of all
humanitya€™ s centuriesa€Da€l

J. Bradford DeLong Says Morea€!

Project Syndicate: In March, you wrote that higher inflation was a€ceinevitable and therefore not 
regrettable,a€\3because it was a€cea side effect and a consequence of the robust
recovery,a€dwhich amounts to a a€cemassive policy victory.a€E2 You also predicted that price 
stability would return in the medium term, though you also noted in June that the
US Federal Reservea€™ s ability to raise interest rates sufficiently was constrained by forward 
guidance. Are you still relatively sanguine about US inflation, and was the
Feda€™ s latest interest-rate hike the right call? How effective will the Inflation Reduction Act 
(IRA) be in supporting the Feda€™ s efforts to ease inflation?
