I think I stole the title from Simon Auerbach from an article he wrote back in 199. And the 
extremely insightful George Scialabba grabbed it for an essay title four years ago. And of course

Slouching Toward Utopia

March 12,2018

Slouching Toward Utopia

In his Critique of Pure Reason, Immanuel Kant wrote that all our interests, practical as well as
speculative, find expression in three questions: What do I know? What should I do? What may I hope? 
The
first      two have attracted the lion's share of attention, at least among philosophers. 
Epistemology, logic, and the
philosophy of science are all concerned with what we can know. Moral philosophy and political 
philosophy
are   largely concerned with what we ought to do. The third question has not been entirely 
neglected, especially
among religious thinkers and novelists, but it is comparatively an orphan. I would like tonight to 
ponder with
you what we may hope, if only we can think our way past a few of the apparently commonsense moral

intuitions that hobble our political and moral imagination.


I'm sorry to say that the prospects for our immediate descendants - that is, for the next two or 
three

generations - seem to me pretty grim, although not for reasons that have anything to do with the 
limitations of
our commonsense moral intuitions. Common sense is, or ought to be, perfectly adequate for 
understanding the
terrifying dangers posed by nuclear weapons and by our reliance on fossil fuels. In 1947, in the 
shadow of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists established its Doomsday Clock as a 
symbol of
the likelihood of a human-caused global catastrophe. Its original setting in 1947 was seven minutes 
to
midnight. Until recently, the closest to midnight that the clock has ever been set was two minutes, 
in 1953,
when    the United States and the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs. In 2017 it was set at 
two and a
half minutes to midnight, reflecting, in the editors' words, "the rise of strident nationalism 
worldwide, United
States President Donald Trump's comments about North Korea, Russia, and nuclear weapons, and the 
Trump
Administration's disbelief in the scientific consensus on climate change." In 2018 it was moved up 
again, to
two      minutes to midnight.

MRS THATCHER’S LABOUR
LAWS: SLOUCHING TOWARDS
UTOPIA?

SIMON AUERBACH*


IN a decade, the shape of labour law in Britain has been transformed. The
conduct of peaceful industrial action, previously almost unfettered, is now
narrowly confined and regulated. Legal props to collective bargaining
have been removed. Support for the closed shop and union membership
arrangements has been replaced by a comprehensive array of prohibi­
tions.  Trade  unions  are  now  subject  to  precision  regulation  of  their
internal affairs, including detailed requirements for the conduct of ballots
before industrial action, and on the election of officials. Unfair dismissal
and  other  employment  protection  rights  have  been  trimmed  and
truncated. By contrast, a range of new rights for trade union members to
sue  their  own  unions  has  been  introduced,  and  a  state-sponsored
Commissioner created, to facilitate litigation.'

In her transformative essay from 1967, Joan Didion takes a closer look at the dark side of the 
Haight-
Ashbury counterculture during the Summer of Love.

Reading Hobsbawm and thinking a€oenoa€”thata€™ s not the right storya€D put one of the bees in my 
bonnet that has led, in the fullness of time, to this book.

There is barely a paragraph in the book that has not been the subject of fierce controversy, or 
thata€™ s point-of-view has not been rejected as wrong by thoughtful and learned historians, or 
that is at the very least massively over- or understated. So I acknowledge that smart people of 
goodwill can deliver trenchant and largely-unanswerable criticisms against nearly every single 
paragraph.
And I very much hope they will do so: it is one of the few ways that I can learn.

2) Also seeing a a€celonga€D twentieth century as most useful is the keen-sighted and learned Ivan 
Berend, An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe: Economic Regimes from Laissez-Faire to 
Globalization, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006 <http: //books .google 
.com/?id=dK44ciNfx6MC>, who makes his choices for essentially the same reasons that I do. He, 
however, confines his book to Europe, and both gains and loses thereby.

Giovanni Arrighi (1994): The Long Twentieth Century (New York: Verso) 
chttps://archive.org/details/longtwentiethcenOOarri>, on yet another hand, pushes the origins of 
the long twentieth century back to 1500 and medieval Genoa. There are 324 pages before his 
a€ceEpiloguea€D begins, yet it is only on page 239 that we get to:

The strategies and structures of capital accumulation that have shaped our times first came into 
existence in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. They originated in a new internalization 
of costs within the economizing logic of capitalist enterprise. Just as the Dutch regime had taken 
world-scale processes of capital accumulation one step further than the Genoese by internalizing 
protection costs, and the British regime had taken them
a step further than the Dutch by internalizing production costs, so the US regime has done the same 
in relation to the British by internalizing transaction costsa€!

Thus I cannot buy into his analysis because he sees the history of the long twentieth century as 
largely an intensified repeat of earlier cycles of internal capitalist development led by a 
hegemonic ’’Genoese, Dutch, British, and now American. That is the grand narrative he tells, 
engagingly and convincingly. But it is definitely not mine, and I definitely do not think it is the 
most important thread

3) Friedrich A, von Hayek, a€oeThe Use of Knowledge in Society ,a€D American Economic Review Vol. 
35, No. 4 (September 1945), pp. 519-530.

a€\the proportional rate of growth of my index of the value of the stock of useful ideas about 
manipulating nature and organizing humansa€\: In the aggregate growth-modeling tradition that has 
developed from Robert Solow, a€oeA Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growtha€D, Quarterly 
Journal of Economics, Vol. 70, No. 1 (Feb., 1956), pp. 65-94 
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/1884513>, the level of real net output per worker Y/L, with Y for net
output and L for the labor force, is a simple mathematical function of the capital-intensity of the 
economy K/Y, of how much of produced means-of-production K per unit of net output there is 
assisting workers in creating that output per worker; and of the efficiency of labor E:

Y/L = (K/Y)A(aD7(l-an°)) E

Such an economy will tend to converge to a steady-state growth path in which the capital intensity 
K/Y approaches its steady-state value (K/Y)* given by:

(K/Y)A* = s/(n+g)

Where s is the net savings-investment rate of the economy, n is the proportional rate of growth of 
the labor force L, and g is the proportional rate of growth of labor efficiency E. (Yes: you 
usually see this equation with a a€ceI'a€D in the denominator for the depreciation rate on capital, 
and with Y defined not as net but gross output, and with s defined as the gross savings rate out of 
gross output. Buta€”as Solow pointed out to me, and has Piketty has
stresseda€”while there is reason to think that having people save a constant proportion of their 
net output is a reasonable baseline case to start from, there is no reason to think that people 
save a constant proportion of their gross outputa€”that net savings would be less in an 
otherwise-identical economy where capital equipment just happened to be less durable.)

The efficiency of labor E can then be thought of as a function of the level of knowledge about 
a€cetechnologya€D Ha€’’discovered, developed, and deployed ideas about manipulating nature and 
organizing humansa€”and of resources per worker R/L, where more resources per worker allow humans 
to be more productive, and where increasing resource scarcity leads to a fall in net output per 
worker Y/L unless there are countervailing improvements in
knowledge:

E = H (R/L)AE>

When natural resources are constanta€”as they are for the world economy as a whole, although not 
for individual sub civilizationsa€”this means that the proportional growth rate of the efficiency 
of labor is:

g = h - Ji>n

If we assume that the world economya€™ s steady-state capital-output ratio is constant across and 
within eras of economic growth, then the rate of growth of output per worker g_Y/L will be the same 
as the rate of growth of the efficiency of labor g. We can then read what the proportional rate of 
growth of knowledge about technology h from the rate of growth of average labor productivity and 
the rate of growth of the global labor force:
h = g_Y/L + ;E>n

I assume Ji>=l/2. Why? If JE>=0, we are assuming that resource scarcity is simply not a thing: that 
at a given level of technological knowledge standards of living are independent of how large 
average firms are and how many workers are drawing on the same metal deposits. If JE>=1 , we are 
assuming that labor is simply unproductive: that total output depends only on the level of 
technological knowledge H and the level of natural resources R, with a doubling of
the labor force leading to a halving of labor productivity. Both of those are clearly wrong. 
Halfway between seems to me a not-unreasonable baseline.

Alternative calculations are easy to do if you have a different sense of how important resource 
scarcity is as a binding or as a not-very-binding constraint on human economies.

There are near-consensus guesses as to the average level of net output per worker and the size of 
the human population since deep time. Under the further assumption that the effective labor force 
is a constant share of the human populationa€”that as the share of the population too young to work 
has fallen, the share that is retired has risen to approximately offseta€”the rate of labor-force 
growth is the same as the rate of population growth. And thus I can
calculate my guesstimates of the rate of growth of h.

4) The growth and international inequality numbers are very disputable and are often disputed. To 
gain a sense of what the current semi-consensus is, see: Hans Rosling et al., Gapminder 
<http://gapminder.org>; Max Roser et al., Our World in Data <http://ourworldindata.org>

5) The source of the idea is, of course, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Manifesto of the Communist 
Party, London: Communist League, 1848 <https ://www.marxists 
.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto .pdf>. My suspicion is that at least in English 
standard readings of Marx and Engels, at least of the Marx and Engels authorial team in the late 
1840s, are not technologically determinist enough. What I see as an assertion in the connotations 
of the
German original of Alles StA^ndische und Stehende verdampft that it is technology that is doing the 
work is lost in the traditional English translation a€ceall that is solid melts into aira€D. 
Jonathan Sperber suggests a€oeE very thing that firmly exists and all the elements of the society 
of orders evaporate ,a€D That seems to me too passive: steamed away. See Jonathan Sperber, Karl 
Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life, New York: Liveright, 2013

<http: //books .google .com/?id=hBpSh9 J YAKcC>.

The underlying ideas, however, are in my opinion best developed by Marshall Berman, All That Is 
Solid Melts into Air: The Experience of Modernity, New York: Verso, 1983 <http://books .google 
.com/?id=mox 1 ywiyhtgC>

Also worth readinga€’’certainly a clearer and more organized thinker than Marx, and one about whom 
I often wonder What kind of thinker would Friedrich Engels have become if he had never met Marx, 
and thus had not come to regard himself as a mere secretary to the Great Man, is Freddie from 
Barmen, Friedrich Engels:

On aCoemetanarrativesaCD:

Wikipedia: Metanarrative chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metanarrative>: Lyotard highlights the 
increasing skepticism of the postmodern condition toward the totalizing nature of metanarratives 
and their reliance on some form of "transcendent and universal truth": a€oeSimplifying to the 
extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity toward metanarratives.  The narrative function is 
losing its functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its

great voyages, its great goal. It is being dispersed in clouds of narrative languagea€!. Where, 
after the metanarratives, can legitimacy reside?a€!a€D

Lyotard and other poststructuralist thinkers (like Foucault) view this as a broadly positive 
development for a number of reasons. First, attempts to construct grand theories tend to unduly 
dismiss the naturally existing chaos and disorder of the universe, the power of the individual 
event. Lyotard proposed that metanarratives should give way to petits rA©cits, or more modest and 
"localized" narratives, which can "throw off" the grand
narrative by bringing into focus the singular event. Borrowing from the works of Wittgenstein and 
his theory of the "models of discourse", Lyotard constructs his vision of a progressive politics, 
grounded in the cohabitation of a whole range of diverse and always locally legitimated 
language-games.

Postmodernists attempt to replace metanarratives by focusing on specific local contexts as well as 
on the diversity of human experience. They argue for the existence of a "multiplicity of 
theoretical standpoints" rather than for grand, all-encompassing theories. According to John 
Stephens and Robyn McCallum, a metanarrative "is a global or totalizing cultural narrative schema 
which orders and explains knowledge and experience" a€“ a
story about a story, encompassing and explaining other "little stories" within conceptual models 
that assemble the "little stories" into a whole. Postmodern narratives will often deliberately 
disturb the formulaic expectations such cultural codes provide, pointing thereby to a possible 
revision of the social codea€!

would mean that individual human eyes and hands and brains are powerless in adding to production,

halfway in between.

are willing to take what I have to say about Solow-Malthus economic-growth theory provisionally on 
faith if only I give you a quick precis to get you to the bottom line?
Then I can help you. Here we go:

Responsiveness of

to prosperity

If we are willing to assume that:

1. A societya€™ s productivity depends primarily on (a) its willingness to save and invest, and (b) 
the efficiency of its workers, which is in turn a function of (c) its level of technology a€’’its 
useful ideas about manipulating nature and organizing humansa€”and (d) its natural resources per 
worker.

2. A societya€™ s population growth rate depends on (a) its level of consumption of necessities 
that make you biologically fit to reproduce relative to (b) its sociologically-determined familial 
and other institutions that potentially curb the rate of reproduction.

3. Societies differ in the proportion of their productive resources they allocate to necessities 
vis-A -vis luxuries.

4. Technological progress before the Industrial-Revolution Age proceeded at a slow average 
proportional growth rate h measured in hundredths of a percent per year.
Then we get:

• The right-hand side of the slide above: the societya€™ s level of productivity per worker will 
head for and then tend to oscillate around a Malthusian level equal to (a) the societya€™ s taste 
for non-necessities (which include such things as having a rapacious and greedy upper class, and 
liking to live in cities), times (b) its sociologically-determined subsistence level of necessities 
consumption (which can be raised by things like a late age of first
female marriage, large-scale female infanticide, or frequent chevauchA©es), times quantitatively 
unimportant nuisance terms.

• The left-hand side of the slide above: the societya€™ s population density will head for and then 
tend to oscillate around a Malthusian level equal to (a) the quality and abundance of natural 
resources per acre, times (b) the ratio of the technology level to the a€cesubsistencea€D level of 
necessities consumption at which the population barely replaces itself, times (c) the propensity to 
save and invest in everything that makes humanity more productive
(from tools to liming the soil to building commercial networks), (d) a chief boost to which its the 
provision of a pax imperia, times (e) the inverse of the taste for non-necessities, all (e) raised 
to the power that is the extent that higher population induces resource scarcity and thus lower 
productivity, times quantitatively unimportant nuisance terms.

As the centuries and millennia pass, the Malthusian equilibrium level of population density will 
slowly rise as technology improves.

And as the centuries and millennia pass, the Malthusian level of typical human living standards 
will slowly rise even as necessities-valued production per worker does not to the extent that there 
is faster technological progress in making middle-class conveniences than in making true 
bioreproductive necessities.
But even though a society tends to go back to its Malthusian equilibrium, it does not have to be 
there: all kinds of shocks can knock it away.

Moreover, and more important, the Malthusian equilibrium can and does shift. There are BigTime 
changes across societies and over time as polity and sociology shift in:

to prosperity

If we are willing to assume that:

1. A societya€™ s productivity depends primarily on (a) its willingness to save and invest, and (b) 
the efficiency of its workers, which is in turn a function of (c) its level of technology a€’’its 
useful ideas about manipulating nature and organizing humansa€”and (d) its natural resources per 
worker.

2. A societya€™ s population growth rate depends on (a) its level of consumption of necessities 
that make you biologically fit to reproduce relative to (b) its sociologically-determined familial 
and other institutions that potentially curb the rate of reproduction.

3. Societies differ in the proportion of their productive resources they allocate to necessities 
vis-A -vis luxuries.

4. Technological progress before the Industrial-Revolution Age proceeded at a slow average 
proportional growth rate h measured in hundredths of a percent per year.
Then we get:

•  The right-hand side of the slide above: the societya€™ s level of productivity per worker will 
head for and then tend to oscillate around a Malthusian level equal to (a) the societya€™ s taste 
for non-necessities (which include such things as having a rapacious and greedy upper class, and 
liking to live in cities), times (b) its sociologically-determined subsistence level of necessities 
consumption (which can be raised by things like a late age of first
female marriage, large-scale female infanticide, or frequent chevauchA©es), times quantitatively 
unimportant nuisance terms.

•  The left-hand side of the slide above: the societya€™ s population density will head for and 
then tend to oscillate around a Malthusian level equal to (a) the quality and abundance of natural 
resources per acre, times (b) the ratio of the technology level to the a€cesubsistencea€D level of 
necessities consumption at which the population barely replaces itself, times (c) the propensity to 
save and invest in everything that makes humanity more productive
(from tools to liming the soil to building commercial networks), (d) a chief boost to which its the 
provision of a pax imperia, times (e) the inverse of the taste for non-necessities, all (e) raised 
to the power that is the extent that higher population induces resource scarcity and thus lower 
productivity, times quantitatively unimportant nuisance terms.

As the centuries and millennia pass, the Malthusian equilibrium level of population density will 
slowly rise as technology improves.

And as the centuries and millennia pass, the Malthusian level of typical human living standards 
will slowly rise even as necessities-valued production per worker does not to the extent that there 
is faster technological progress in making middle-class conveniences than in making true 
bioreproductive necessities.
But even though a society tends to go back to its Malthusian equilibrium, it does not have to be 
there: all kinds of shocks can knock it away.

Moreover, and more important, the Malthusian equilibrium can and does shift. There are BigTime 
changes across societies and over time as polity and sociology shift in:

• the subsistence level of necessities consumption

• the taste for luxuries

• the incentives to save and invest

These drive big differences in how societies look and are, and big differences in how societiesa€™ 
economies grow and shrink: truly dire Dark Ages like post-Roman Britain or the early-Iron Age 
Afgean; truly magnificent (if often cruel and astonishingly unequal) civilizational 
a€ceefflorescencesa€D as Jack Goldstone has taught us to call them. Establish a pax imperia, with 
associated protection of commerce and industry from freelance expropriation by
thugs with spears through a government that controls its own functionaries and so generate lots of 
savings, investment, and an increased division of labor; acquire a taste for luxuries, especially 
living in cities and upper-class and even middle-class display of comfort; and generate 
sociological institutions that curb and control female fertility and female-child survival, and 
watch what happens. On the other side, have barbarians within the gate so that as much
wealth as possible is immediately turned into silver and buried, establish a sociology of very 
early female first marriage, and have little taste for or indeed specialization in producing 
non-necessitiesa€”and your Malthusian equilibrium can shift to something of interest to 
archAiologists, but not of interest to artists or indeed to connoisseurs of material culture.

Moreover, remember this always: the gulf between the standard of living of the upper and even the 
middle class (who leave the major archAiological footprint) on the one hand and the 
peasant-craftsman-servant working class on the other, whose reproduction generates the resource 
scarcity that anchors the Malthusian equilibrium^’’that can and does vary widely and wildly as well.
That pre-Industrial Revolution Age history was a€ceMalthusiana€D does not mean that nothing 
interesting happened, or that everything was the same.
