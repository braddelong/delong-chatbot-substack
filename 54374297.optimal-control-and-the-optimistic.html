You have an objective: to get inflation back into its target range over the medium term—five to ten years from now—and to do so while doing the least damage to other objectives like employment and growth. If your best forecast is that your current policy path gets you there, you maintain your currency policy path. If your best forecast is that your current policy path does <em><strong>not</strong></em> get you there, you take the cheapest and most effective step to move the future needle. If the bond-market 5-year 5-year forward inflation breakeven is not the best forecast, what is the best forecast? Indeed, given that inflation is an expectational phenomenon in all our standard models—inflation will be what it is expected to be plus policy-change and economic-shock terms—it is very hard to see how the bond-market 5-year 5-year forward inflation breakeven could not be the best forecast. And if our standard models are not the best models, what are the best models?</p><p>Thus I look at this, and I think those who claim inflation is “out of control” are doing their audiences and their selves no good service…</p><p>Me over at Project Syndicate:</p><div><hr></div><p><em>With commentators offering increasingly dismal warnings about the inflation situation in the United States, one might think that the US Federal Reserve has failed completely at its primary task. But the bond market is telling a different story, and there is no reason to think that it is driven by doves.</em></p><p>BERKELEY – As of Friday, May 6, the bond market expected US consumer price inflation to average <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T5YIFR#0">2.5%</a> between five and ten years from now. That is the rate of inflation needed to equalize returns on inflation-indexed and non-indexed US Treasury securities. And given that <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T5YIE">CPI inflation</a> has been running higher than the rate associated with the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures, I count that 2.5% five-year, five-year-forward rate as hitting the US Federal Reserve’s 2% price-deflator inflation target.</p><p>What, then, would it take to get the economy back to the Fed’s targeted inflation rate? Since the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T5YIE">five-year breakeven rate</a> at the close of May 6 was 3.22%, the implicit expectation is that inflation will run a cumulative total of 3.6 percentage points above the Fed’s target over the next five years. If it does not cause the economy’s inflation anchor to vanish, a deviation of that size would be an exceedingly small price to pay for the rapid recovery from the pandemic-induced recession. If the recovery delivers the structural economic transformation that we need, the higher inflation that we have experienced will have been well worth it.</p><p>Accordingly, it seems to me that the Fed should be taking a victory lap. It has done precisely what it is supposed to do, by enabling America’s sticky-price, sticky-wage, sticky-debt economy to return rapidly not just to full employment but to the right version of full employment – the one that has workers working in sectors making products for which there is real, fundamental demand – after a shock. And it has done so without disrupting confidence in the monetary system and its stability.</p><p>So why does the very sharp <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/kenneth-rogoff">Kenneth Rogoff</a> of Harvard University <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-03/rogoff-sees-fed-hiking-rates-up-to-5-as-things-out-of-control?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-economics">argue</a> that “things are way out of control”? If you have been diverted from your desired trajectory, and you then find yourself on a path where you can expect to return to it, I would think the only way to describe the situation is as a case of being “in control.”</p><p>Rogoff makes clear that there is “a lot of uncertainty,” and that he is “not going to say I know exactly what needs to be done.” But his observation that inflation is “way out of control” makes sense only to the extent that he is willing to declare the bond market and its implicit expectations to be wrong. Only then could the expected evolution of Fed policy lead to inflation significantly higher than 3.22% over the next five years, and to average inflation significantly above 2.5% 5-10 years hence.</p><p>Sure, that could happen. The economy is a surprising place, and our models and forecasts are ultimately just poorly informed guesses. The Fed might have to change course substantially. It might have to send the US economy into a substantial recession with significantly higher-than-expected interest rates to return inflation to its target over the five- to ten-year medium run.</p><p>For Rogoff’s own implied forecast to come to pass, workers and bosses would have to reach wage bargains that assume inflation well above 3.2% for the next five years and well above 2.5% for the five years after that. Moreover, those inflationary wage bargains would have to be locked in place through contracts and institutional arrangements that would make it hard to revise them downward should they turn out to have exaggerated actual inflation. For workers and bosses to do that, they would have to be pretty confident that bond traders are irrationally Panglossian – that they are inflation doves despite the evidence to the contrary.</p><p>Is there any reason to think that bond traders are irrational Panglossian inflation doves? Are there any reasons to think that workers and bosses now believe that bond traders are irrational Panglossian inflation doves?</p><p>I see none.</p><p>In our modern economy, an outbreak of inflation is a peculiar expectations-driven process. It requires a vicious circle in which expectations of high inflation drive actions that then validate those expectations – with higher wages leading to higher consumer prices that in turn lead to demands for higher wages, ad infinitum. For this to happen, the expectation of high inflation has to come from somewhere, and as of now, it is not in evidence.</p><p>Yes, additional adverse supply shocks could lie in our future. The COVID-19 virus still has the potential to mutate and confront us with dangerous, disruptive new strains. Further disruptions could emanate from a widening of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine or from an economically catastrophic interaction of new virus variants and China’s zero-COVID policy. These kinds of developments could push inflation out of control.</p><p>But the fact that such risks exist does not mean we should live as if they have already come to pass, and thus ignore the world as it currently is.</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/bond-market-medium-term-inflation-currently-on-target-by-j-bradford-delong-2022-05">https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/bond-market-medium-term-inflation-currently-on-target-by-j-bradford-delong-2022-05</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/optimal-control-and-the-optimistic?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/optimal-control-and-the-optimistic?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video: Big-Data Economic History:</h2><p><strong>Melissa Dell</strong>: <em>Automating the Large Scale Digitization of Historical Data: IDSS Distinguished Speaker Seminar</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnM7ePr6xqM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnM7ePr6xqM</a>&gt;: </p><div id="youtube2-mnM7ePr6xqM" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;mnM7ePr6xqM&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mnM7ePr6xqM?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay;

People (including me) we're all looking at derivatives in the foreign exchange market, not in the mortgage market. I regulators making the same mistake with "crypto"?:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Cory Doctorow</strong>: <em>Defi &amp; Shadow Banking 2.0: Leverage, Rigidity &amp; Bank Runs</em>: ‘The shadow banking system’s “innovations” produced…. I. Leverage… every routine transaction in the real economy could result in fortunes changing hands in the shadow banking world. II. Rigidity… automatic sell-offs or margin calls when certain things took place. In good times, these made the gambling seem safe. During a crisis, these turned into suicide pacts. III. Bank-runs: When over-leveraged assets hit a bump, the leverage and the rigidity of the contracts meant to “de-risk” it triggered cascading price-drops… which drives otherwise sound institutions to collapse. The shadow-banking system created a whole menagerie of exotic “products” that all shared one characteristic: they were complex. The complexity of these instruments made it hard to know when you were taking a sucker’s bet. Worse, they made it hard for designers, analysts and executives to understand how all the pieces fit together…. Even where Congress didn’t tie regulators’ hands, those regulators chose to sit on them, taking a wait-and-see approach to shadow banking…. </p><p>Hilary Allen… makes the case that defi, the “distributed finance” wing of Web3, is really “Shadow Banking 2.0” &lt;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4038788">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4038788</a>&gt;…. Smart contracts don’t just create instability by being too complex to understand and vulnerable to coding errors—they’re also fraud magnets. In the glory days of the Big Con, ropers for con artists would ride the railroads, looking for marks and setting up the con. If the mark was a gambler, they’d send a telegram ahead to their confederates calling for a stock swindle, where the gambler would be out of his depth. If the mark was a stock broker, they’d call for a horse-racing scam, because brokers didn’t understand the ponies. The Venn intersection of “people who code” and “people who understand finance” is so small it’s a sphincter. Scammers who work smart contracts don’t even need to change up the swindle: no matter whether the mark is a coder or a banker, there will be key elements of the game they can’t make heads nor tails of…. </p><p>Allen notes that defi advocates will accuse her of focusing solely on defi’s risks and not on its benefits, notably, the decentralization that is the “de” in “defi.” Allen counters by citing a paper from the Bank of International Settlements that critiques the “decentralisation illusion” &lt;<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2112b.pdf">https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2112b.pdf</a>&gt;….

For Mommsen… the key dynamic… was… the structural rather than intentional process by which, in the essentially chaotic Nazi regime, radical ideology more or less organically begot radical measures by bureaucrats contending for power and Hitler’s favor, which in turn generated even more radical measures, which only in retrospect could appear to be part of some pre-ordained master plan…. An unfortunate consequence of the otherwise quite appropriate insistence that Nazism in general and the Holocaust in particular were uniquely horrific historical events is that people are sometimes too hesitant to see parallels…. I would…suggest that it’s worth thinking about how “cumulative radicalization” is a more universal process, that has applicability to what is happening on the American right wing today. Another parallel worth thinking about is how in some ways “weak”—to use Mommsen’s counter-intuitive word for describing Hitler—leader of a fanatical political cult can still dominate all aspects of that cult’s development, despite his fundamental laziness, inattention to detail, contempt for bureaucratic regularity, tolerance for and even active encouragement of the most venal corruption….

The big lesson of the past is not to sell when you feel like it, and not to buy when you feel like it. For if you feel like it, probably lots of other people feel like it too—and you do not want to pay the price-pressure penalty that selling or buying when all of them do will inflict on you:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Michael Batnick</strong>: <em>Twenty Lessons Learned</em>: ‘1. Nothing lasts forever. When growth stocks were going up every day, it felt like it would never end. Now that growth stocks are going down, it feels like it will never end. Everything ends, eventually. 2. Survival is the most important thing. Your portfolio must be able to weather euphoria, panic, and malaise. 3. Risk management is most critical when it feels like you’re getting punished for managing risk. 4. Nothing is a perfect inflation hedge. Not gold, stocks, crypto, or cash. Different inflation hedges work in different inflationary regimes. No one size fits all. 5. Diversification is the only answer to an unpredictable future. If everything is working, you’re not really diversified. 6. Interest rates matter a lot. The cost of money is the lifeblood of the economy and the psychological north star for investors. 7. Nothing is risk-free. The S&amp;P 500 is down 16% year-to-date. Intermediate-term “risk-free” government bonds are down 20%. 8. You’re not a genius on the way up or an idiot on the way down. 9. When everything is going down, everybody loses money. 10.Analogies are dangerous. We know how things played out in the past. That doesn’t tell us how things will play out in the future. 12. The more confident somebody seems, the more cautious you should be in taking their advice. 13. Inflation is unpredictable. 14. Memes are not fundamentals. 15. Nobody knows what will happen next. 16. There are no new paradigms. 17. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Past behavior is. 18. Too much leverage will eventually come back to bite you. 19. Cash is not trash. 20.

As a customer, it can be an inconvenience…. But I’ve come to appreciate how efficient it is. The stores’ properties use up a fraction of the land of a conventional supermarket…. The prices, not unrelatedly, are extremely competitive…. It reminds me of Eden Center in Falls Church, Virginia, a large strip plaza mostly consisting of Vietnamese shops and restaurants. It’s a cultural and commercial center for the Vietnamese community in the area and beyond, and it’s also something of a tourist destination. The parking lot is crammed full on weekends and frequently even on weekdays. It took me and my wife 10 minutes to find a space one Saturday at lunch time. This doesn’t mean there isn’t enough parking, because again, the spots turn over quickly enough. It means that the parking lot is being fully utilized…. Between parking minimums and elevated vacancies in the age of ecommerce, we’ve massively overbuilt parking.
