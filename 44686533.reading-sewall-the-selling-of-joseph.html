It is most certain that all Men, as they are the Sons of&nbsp;Adam, are&nbsp;Coheirs; and have equal Right unto Liberty, and all other outward Comforts of Life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>GOD&nbsp;hath given the Earth&nbsp;[with all its Commodities]&nbsp;unto the Sons&nbsp;of Adam,&nbsp;Psal&nbsp;115.&nbsp;And hath made of One Blood, all Nations of Men, for to dwell on all the face of the Earth;&nbsp;and hath determined the Times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation: That they should seek the Lord. Forasmuch then as we are the Offspring of GOD.</p><p>Now although the Title given by the last ADAM, doth infinitely better&nbsp;Mens&nbsp;Estates,&nbsp;respecting GOD and themselves; and grants them a most beneficial and inviolable&nbsp;Lease under the Broad Seal of Heaven, who were before only Tenants at Will: Yet&nbsp;through the Indulgence of GOD to our First Parents after the Fall, the outward Estate&nbsp;&nbsp;of all and every of the Children, remains the same, as to one another. So that&nbsp;Originally, and Naturally, there is no such thing as Slavery.&nbsp;Joseph&nbsp;was rightfully no&nbsp;more a Slave to his Brethren,&nbsp;then&nbsp;they were to him: and they had no more Authority&nbsp;to&nbsp;Sell&nbsp;him, than they had to&nbsp;Slay&nbsp;him. And if&nbsp;they&nbsp;had nothing to do to Sell him;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ishmaelites&nbsp;bargaining with them, and paying down Twenty pieces of Silver, could&nbsp;not make a Title. Neither could&nbsp;Potiphar&nbsp;have any better Interest in him than the&nbsp;Ishmaelites&nbsp;had.&nbsp;For he that shall in this case plead&nbsp;Alteration of&nbsp;&nbsp;Property, seems to have forfeited a great part of his own claim to Humanity.</p><p>There is&nbsp;no proportion between Twenty Pieces of Silver, and LIBERTY. The Commodity&nbsp;itself is the Claimer. If&nbsp;Arabian&nbsp;Gold be imported in any quantities, most are afraid&nbsp;&nbsp;to meddle with it, though they might have it at easy rates; lest if it should have&nbsp;been wrongfully taken from the Owners, it should kindle a fire to the Consumption&nbsp;of their whole Estate.&nbsp;‘Tis&nbsp;pity there should be more Caution used in buying a&nbsp;Horse, or a little lifeless dust;&nbsp;than&nbsp;there is in purchasing Men and Women:&nbsp;Whenas&nbsp;&nbsp;they are the Offspring of GOD, and their Liberty is, Auro&nbsp;pretiosior&nbsp;Omni.&nbsp;</p><p>And seeing GOD hath said, “He that&nbsp;Stealeth&nbsp;a Man and&nbsp;Selleth&nbsp;him, or if he be&nbsp;found in his hand, he shall surely be put to Death.”&nbsp;Exod. 12.16. This Law being of&nbsp;Everlasting Equity, wherein Man Stealing is ranked amongst the most atrocious of&nbsp;Capital Crimes: What louder Cry can there be made of the Celebrated Warning,&nbsp;Caveat Emptor!&nbsp;</p><p>And all thing considered, it would conduce more to the Welfare of the Province,&nbsp;to have White Servants for a Term of Years, than to have Slaves for Life. Few can&nbsp;endure to hear of a Negro’s being made free; and indeed they can seldom use&nbsp;their freedom well; yet their continual aspiring after their forbidden Liberty, renders&nbsp;them Unwilling Servants. And there is such a disparity in their Conditions,&nbsp;Color &amp; Hair, that they can never embody with us, and grow up into orderly Families,&nbsp;to the Peopling of the Land: but still remain in our Body Politick as a kind of extra-vasat&nbsp;Blood. As many Negro men as there are among us, so many empty places there&nbsp;are in our Train Bands, and the places taken up of Men that might make Husbands&nbsp;for our Daughters. And the Sons and Daughters of&nbsp;New England&nbsp;would become more&nbsp;like&nbsp;Jacob, and&nbsp;Rachel, if this Slavery were thrust quite out of doors. Moreover it is&nbsp;too well known what Temptations Masters are under, to connive at the&nbsp;Fornification&nbsp;of their Slaves; lest they should be obliged to find them Wives, or pay their Fines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It seems to be practically pleaded that they might be Lawless;&nbsp;’tis thought much of,&nbsp;that the Law should have Satisfaction for their Thefts, and other Immoralities; by&nbsp;which means,&nbsp;Holiness to the Lord, is more rarely&nbsp;engraven&nbsp;upon this sort of Servitude.&nbsp;It is likewise most lamentable to think, how in taking Negros out of&nbsp;Africa, and Selling&nbsp;of them here, That which GOD ha’s&nbsp;joyned&nbsp;together men do boldly rend asunder;&nbsp;Men from their Country, Husbands from their Wives, Parents from their Children.&nbsp;</p><p>How horrible is the Uncleanness, Mortality, if not Murder, that the Ships are&nbsp;guilty of that bring great&nbsp;Crouds&nbsp;of these miserable Men, and Women. Methinks,&nbsp;when we are bemoaning the barbarous Usage of our Friends and Kinsfolk in&nbsp;Africa:&nbsp;&nbsp;it might not be unseasonable to enquire whether we are not culpable in forcing the&nbsp;Africans&nbsp;to become Slaves amongst&nbsp;our selves. And it may be a question whether all&nbsp;the Benefit received by&nbsp;Negro&nbsp;Slaves, will balance the&nbsp;Accompt&nbsp;of Cash laid out upon&nbsp;them; and for the Redemption of our own enslaved Friends out of&nbsp;Africa. Besides&nbsp;all the Persons and Estates that have perished there.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p>Obj. 1.&nbsp;These&nbsp;Blackamores&nbsp;are of the Posterity of&nbsp;Cham,&nbsp;and therefore are&nbsp;under the Curse of Slavery. Gen. 9.25, 26, 27.&nbsp;</p><p>Answ. Of all Offices, one would not&nbsp;begg&nbsp;this;&nbsp;viz.&nbsp;Uncall’d&nbsp;for, to be an&nbsp;&nbsp;Executioner of the Vindictive Wrath of God; the extent and duration of which is to&nbsp;us uncertain. If this ever was a Commission; How do we know but that it is long&nbsp;&nbsp;since out of date? Many have found it to their Cost, that a Prophetical Denunciation&nbsp;of Judgment against a Person or People, would not warrant them to inflict that&nbsp;evil. If it would,&nbsp;Hazael&nbsp;might justify himself in all he did against his Master, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Israelites, from 2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;8. 10, 12.&nbsp;</p><p>But it is possible that by cursory reading, this Text may have been mistaken. For&nbsp;Canaan&nbsp;is the Person Cursed three times over, without the mentioning of&nbsp;Cham. Good&nbsp;Expositors suppose the Curse entailed on him, and that this&nbsp;Prophesie&nbsp;was&nbsp;accomplished in the Extirpation of the&nbsp;Canaanites, and in the Servitude of the&nbsp;Gibeonites,&nbsp;Vide&nbsp;Pareum. Whereas the Blackmores are not descended of&nbsp;Canaan, but of&nbsp;Cush.&nbsp;</p><p>Psal. 68. 31.&nbsp;Princes shall come out of Egypt&nbsp;[Mizraim]&nbsp;Ethopia&nbsp;[Cush]&nbsp;shall soon&nbsp;stretch out her hands unto God. Under which Names, all&nbsp;Africa&nbsp;may be comprehended;&nbsp;and the Promised Conversion ought to be prayed for.&nbsp;Jer. 13, 23.&nbsp;Can the&nbsp;Ethiopian change his skin?&nbsp;This shews that Black Men are the Posterity of&nbsp;Cush: Who&nbsp;time out of mind have been distinguished by their&nbsp;Colour. And for want of the&nbsp;true,&nbsp;Ovid&nbsp;assigns a fabulous cause of it.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Sanguine tum&nbsp;credunt&nbsp;in corpora summa&nbsp;vocato&nbsp;<br>Aethiopum&nbsp;populos&nbsp;nigrum&nbsp;traxisse&nbsp;colorem.&nbsp;Metamorph. lib.2.</em>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Obj. 2.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Nigers&nbsp;are brought out of a Pagan Country, into places where&nbsp;the Gospel is Preached.&nbsp;</p><p>Answ. Evil must not be done, that good may come of it. The extraordinary and&nbsp;comprehensive Benefit accruing to the Church of God, and to&nbsp;Joseph&nbsp;personally, did&nbsp;not rectify his&nbsp;brethrens&nbsp;Sale of him.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p>Obj. 3.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Africans&nbsp;have Wars with one another: our Ships bring lawful&nbsp;Captives taken in those Wars.&nbsp;</p><p>Answ. For ought is known, their Wars are much such as were between&nbsp;Jacob’s&nbsp;Sons and their Brother&nbsp;Joseph. If they be between Town and Town; Provincial, or&nbsp;National: Every War is upon one side Unjust. An Unlawful War can’t make lawful&nbsp;Captives. And by Receiving, we are in danger to promote, and partake in their&nbsp;Barbarous Cruelties. I am sure, if some Gentlemen should go down to the&nbsp;Brewsters&nbsp;to take the Air, and Fish: And a stronger party from&nbsp;Hull&nbsp;should Surprise them, and&nbsp;Sell them for Slaves to a Ship outward bound: they would think themselves unjustly&nbsp;dealt with; both by Sellers and Buyers. And yet&nbsp;’tis to be feared, we have no&nbsp;other kind of Title to our&nbsp;Nigers.&nbsp;Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men&nbsp;should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets. Matt. 7. 12.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p>Obj. 4. Abraham&nbsp;had servants bought with his Money, and born in his&nbsp;House.&nbsp;</p><p>Answ. Until the Circumstances of&nbsp;Abraham’s&nbsp;purchase be recorded, no Argument&nbsp;can be drawn from it. In the&nbsp;mean time, Charity obliges us to conclude, that He&nbsp;knew it was lawful and good.&nbsp;</p><p>It is Observable that the&nbsp;Israelites&nbsp;were strictly forbidden the buying, or selling one&nbsp;another for Slaves.&nbsp;Levit. 25. 39, 46.&nbsp;Jer. 34. 8–22. And GOD gaged His&nbsp;Blessing in lieu of any loss they might&nbsp;conceipt&nbsp;they suffered thereby.&nbsp;Deut. 15. 18.&nbsp;&nbsp;And since the partition Wall is broken down, inordinate&nbsp;Self love&nbsp;should likewise be&nbsp;demolished. GOD expects that Christians should be of a more Ingenuous and benign&nbsp;frame of spirit. Christians should carry it to all the World, as the&nbsp;Israelites&nbsp;were to&nbsp;carry it one towards another. And for men obstinately to persist in holding their&nbsp;Neighbours&nbsp;and Brethren under the Rigor of perpetual Bondage, seems to be no proper&nbsp;way of gaining Assurance that God ha’s given them Spiritual Freedom. Our Blessed&nbsp;Saviour&nbsp;ha’s altered the Measures of the Ancient Love-Song, and set it to a most&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent New Tune, which all ought to be ambitious of Learning.&nbsp;Matt. 5. 43, 44.&nbsp;John&nbsp;13. 34. These&nbsp;Ethiopians, as black as they are; seeing they are the Sons and&nbsp;Daughters of the First&nbsp;Adam, the Brethren and Sister of the Last ADAM, and the&nbsp;Offspring of GOD; They ought to be treated with a Respect agreeable.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Servitus&nbsp;perfecta voluntaria, inter&nbsp;Christianum&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Christiainum, ex parte&nbsp;servi&nbsp;patientis&nbsp;saepe&nbsp;est&nbsp;licita,&nbsp;quia&nbsp;est&nbsp;necessaria: sed ex parte&nbsp;domini&nbsp;agentis, &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;procurando &amp;&nbsp;exercendo,&nbsp;vix&nbsp;potest&nbsp;esse&nbsp;licita:&nbsp;quia&nbsp;non&nbsp;convenit&nbsp;regulae&nbsp;illi&nbsp;generali:&nbsp;Quaecunque&nbsp;volueritis&nbsp;ut&nbsp;faciant&nbsp;vobis&nbsp;homines,&nbsp;ita&nbsp;&amp; vos&nbsp;facite&nbsp;eis</em>.&nbsp;Matt. 7.12.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Perfecta&nbsp;servitus&nbsp;poenae, non&nbsp;potest&nbsp;jure&nbsp;locum&nbsp;habere,&nbsp;nisi&nbsp;ex&nbsp;delicto&nbsp;gravi&nbsp;quod&nbsp;ultimum&nbsp;supplicum&nbsp;aliquo&nbsp;modo&nbsp;meretur:&nbsp;quia&nbsp;Libertas ex&nbsp;naturali&nbsp;aestimatione&nbsp;proxime&nbsp;accedit&nbsp;ad&nbsp;vitam&nbsp;ipsam, &amp;&nbsp;eidem&nbsp;a multis&nbsp;proeferri&nbsp;solet.</em>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>BOSTON of the&nbsp;Massachusets;&nbsp;Printed by&nbsp;Bartholomew Green, and&nbsp;John Allen, June, 24th. 1700.
