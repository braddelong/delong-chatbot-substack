But after 1870 we began to wriggle out from the traps that we were then in. So most people back then would, had they been able to foresee our immense technological power and sophistication, have expected us to have built our world that we live in today into a paradise, a utopia.</p><p>We manifestly have not.</p><p>What went wrong?</p><p>Back before 1870 the human population was always too large relative to our low (and slowly improving) level of technology, and our limited ability to harvest natural resources. Why? Because poverty made infant mortality very high, and patriarchy meant that women’s durable social power (with a few exceptions) came pretty much only from being mothers of surviving sons…</p><p

There is a clear difference between <em>acting tough</em> and actually <em>being tough</em>. The former is all about outward fierceness and savagery, while the latter is about the inner ability to endure hardship and pain and fear and still keep fighting effectively. In fact, this difference is a reason why authoritarian, illiberal regimes traditionally underestimate more liberal ones. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/322535-i-don-t-see-much-future-for-the-americans-it-s">The Nazis</a>… <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/openms-2022-0124/html?lang=en">Imperial Japan</a>… the Confederacy….

What we instinctively mean when we say “liberal” and “illiberal”…. A lot of it is simply about conquerors vs. defenders. There’s a clear difference between the vision of a world where “the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must”, and the vision of a world where every country is free to determine its own destiny…. Ukraine’s successes have sent us messages about what’s worth fighting for.
