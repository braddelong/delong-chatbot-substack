After all, the German generals thought—to all appearances correctly—that they were also relatively unprepared for war in 1938, and in much better shape in 1939-1940.

Part I: Words</em>: ‘What is… remarkable… is not that the people of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages lost some books… but that they <em>saved</em> some…. Never before had a literary tradition been saved in this way…. Unsurprisingly, Christian monks… tended to copy a lot more religious texts… works… seen as important for teaching good Latin (Cicero, Vergil, etc.) tended to get copied more…. Far from <em>destroying</em> the literature of classical antiquity, it was the medieval Church itself that was the single institution <em>most engaged</em> in the preservation of it…. Writers… did not <em>stop writing</em> (or stop reading)…. [That] the literature of this period was religious… is no reason to dismiss it…. St. Augustine of Hippo… <em>The City of God</em>…. Isidore of Seville (560–636) was famous for his <em>Etymologies</em>, an encyclopedia of sorts which would form the foundation for much of medieval learning and which in its summaries preserves for us quite a lot of classical bits and bobs which would have otherwise been lost; he also invented the period, comma and colon. Pope Gregory I (540–604) was also a prolific writer, writing hundreds of letters, a collection of four books of dialogues, a life of St. Benedict, a book on the role of bishops, a commentary on the Book of Job and so on. <em>The Rule of St. Benedict</em>… in 516 established the foundation for western monasticism…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://acoup.blog/2022/01/14/collections-rome-decline-and-fall-part-i-words/">https://acoup.blog/2022/01/14/collections-rome-decline-and-fall-part-i-words/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>That the remarkable thing about the literate monk culture of the Mediæval Age was not that they sacrificed so many ancient manuscripts as they recycled the parchment, but that they saved so many—that is a superb point. Previously, when ruling powers and elites shifted, the successors had very little regard for what their predecessors had written and thought. So what we have are buried papyrii in arid landscapes, inscriptions that have survived, and clay baked, filed, and buried. A tradition of manuscripts from predecessor civilizations copied, kept in libraries, and then used for intellectual and cultural work—that was the creation of the Islamic and the Christian scholars, who found worth in Classical Roman and Greek authors. That we have 650 of Sappho’s 10,000 lines is indeed a miracle.</p><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/the-remarkable-preservation-of-classical?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading this.

They hit a speedbump from 1973–1979, yes. But that speedbump was of very small magnitude compared to all of those we have experienced since. Yet somehow that speedbump was enough to cause Social Democracy to fail its political-stability test, and lead to its replacement by Neoliberalism. Neoliberalism has, in the Global North, durably delivered on none of its promises save to greatly enrich the rich. And it has hit many speedbumps, and more than speedbumps. Yet it, with its many failures, has proved remarkably durable in a way that its predecessor, Social Democracy, did not. I find this very mysterious. You can say that the game is finally played out, and that right-neoliberalism in its advanced decomposition is searching for an alliance with neofascism because the game is played out. And it is true history rhymes: those attached to the pseudo-classical semi-liberal system of the Belle Époque similarly reached for an alliance with real fascism in the chaos of 1914–1933.

A few months ago I made a mistake. I joined a friend of mine and I played golf at a country club. It didn’t have any African-American members. I was criticized for doing it. You know what? I was rightly criticized for doing it. I made a mistake. And I said I wouldn’t ever do that again.</p><p>I think all of us have got to be sensitive to that. We can’t get anywhere in this country pointing the finger across racial lines. If we do that, we’re dead and they will beat us. Even in Reverend Jackson’s new math of this election, it’s hard to get to a 34% solution or a 40% solution if the American people can be divided by race."</p></blockquote><p>Yes, Clinton did pounce on Jesse Jackson for inviting Sister Souljah to speak…. “In United States politics, a Sister Souljah moment is a politician’s public repudiation of an extremist person or group, statement, or position.”… That is what the memory of it has become. That is what people are calling on Biden to do when they call on him to find a “Sister Souljah” moment. But Clinton was trying to do something more complex.

Six P-cores and eight E-cores for a total of 14 cores and 20 threads, with a peak Turbo Boost clock speed of 5 GHz for the P-cores…. The single-core performance improvements… are appreciable but relatively small, measuring between 10 and 20 percent…. Eight E-cores are unquestionably better at getting multithreaded work done than two P-cores. Every multi-core test… show[s] the 12th-generation i9 outrunning the 11th-generation CPU by about 33 percent….
