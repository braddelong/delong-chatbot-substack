First:

I have recently uncovered a substantial hole in my visualization of the Cosmic All:

I understand feudal politics: A network of connections, most vertical, some horizontal, overlapping 
with kin and marriage ties, allocating resources and support of various kinds. I understand 
Republican politics: an electorate plus local notables with their client networks Competing to win 
elections, after which magistrates with various forms of imperium take office and function within 
some agreed-upon legal structure, in attempts to maintain and expand the
coalition that elected them and also to accomplish what they think are good policy goals.

But suppose you have politics as the internal workings of a self-replacing and co-opting elite 
which organizes itself neither according to public demonstrations of the vox populi nor according 
to the construction of a publicly-visible network of lords and vessels, but otherwise? Suppose you 
have politics through some process of the selection, promotion, and purging and derogA©ance of 
personnel, all working behind a Rousseauist mask of enthusiastic obedience
and submission to the general will? I really do not understand how such systems work. And so I do 
not understand the modern Republican Party, or the Chinese Communist Party in either the Mao Zedong 
or the Xi Jinping eras, or, indeed, many other important things about how the world we live in 
actually works.

It seems to be largely a scorpions-in-the-bottle game. You are a member of a committee that can 
purge anyone beneath you. But you cannot purge everyone: someone has to do the work, and keep the 
system running. Those you purge have friends, allies, networks. They may be waiting in the weeds 
for whenever it becomes your turn in the barrel, and so you would like to leave as few enemies as 
possible armed behind you.
Moreover, there are higher-ups who are on committees that can purge you. Those you purge may or may 
not have links that you do or do not understand to your own supervisory committee.

Plus there is the Trump carda€”or the Mao jokera€”Of actors in the system who have direct, 
charismatic linkages to forces outside both the formal structures of bureaucratic authority and the 
selection-promotion-purging logic of normal politics. Such appeals to outside can take many forms: 
army versus party, cadres versus officials, primary electorate versus incumbents, the Han 
scholar-bureaucracy versus the Ming eunuchs, or the Han scholar-bureaucracy
versus the Manchu semi-feudal network made up of the hereditary bondsmen of the ruling clan.

So what do I do next to try to figure this out?

I suspect that the right thing to do is to somehow find time to re-read Ronald Syme (1939): The 
Roman Revolution (Oxford: Clarendon) <https://archive.org/details/romanrevolutionOOOOsyme>. But 
maybe there is a better book?

Xi Jinping: The CCPa€™ s 100th Anniversarya: a€~The Chinese nation is a great nation. With a 
history of more than 5,000 yearsa€!. After the Opium War of 1840, however, China was gradually 
reduced to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society and suffered greater ravages than ever before. The 
country endured intense humiliation, the people were subjected to great pain, and the Chinese 
civilization was plunged into darkness. Since that time, national
rejuvenation has been the greatest dream of the Chinese people and the Chinese nationa€!. The 
Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, the Reform Movement of 1898, the Yihetuan Movement, and the 
Revolution of 1911 rose one after the other, and a variety of plans were devised to ensure national 
survival, but all of these ended in failurea€!. The founding of a communist party in China was an 
epoch-making event, which profoundly changed the course of
Chinese historya€!. Since the very day of its founding, the Party has made seeking happiness for 
the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation its aspiration and missiona€!. Through 
the Northern Expedition, the Agrarian Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance against Japanese 
Aggression, and the War of Liberation, we fought armed counter-revolution with armed revolution, 
toppling the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and
bureaucrat-capitalism and establishing the Peoplea€™ s Republic of China, which made the people 
masters of the country. We thus secured our nationa€™ s independence and liberated our peoplea€!. 
We established the Partya€™ s basic line for the primary stage of socialism, resolutely advanced 
reform and opening up, overcame risks and challenges from every direction, and founded, upheld, 
safeguarded, and developed socialism with Chinese characteristics,
thus     bringing about a major turn with far-reaching significance in the history of the Party 
since the founding of the Peoplea€™ s Republic of China. This enabled China to transform itself 
from a highly centralized planned economy to a socialist market economy brimming with vitality, and 
from a country that was largely isolated to one that is open to the outside world across the board. 
It also enabled China to achieve the historic leap from a country with
relatively backward productive forces to the worlda€™ s second largest economy, and to make the 
historic transformation of raising the living standards of its people from bare subsistence to an 
overall level of moderate prosperitya€!. The Party has united and led the Chinese people in 
pursuing a great struggle, a great project, a great cause, and a great dream through a spirit of 
self-confidence, self-reliance, and innovation, achieving great success for socialism
with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
