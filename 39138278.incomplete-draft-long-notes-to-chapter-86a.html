It is from his recounts as a major source, the former leader Chang is usually understood as a corrupt and incapable feudal bureaucrat who readily sell the Kaiping Mine to shun his responsibilities in saving its declining output and accumulating debts, to gain more personal interests, and to avoid attacks from the Boxers. Such stigmatizing narration is further corroborated by predominant attacks of Chang's irresponsibility from Chinese officials led by one of the most powerful military politicians, Yuan Shihkai, in 1903. </p><p>However, to better understand this specific figure's role in the patrimony issue of Kaiping Mine, and whether Hoover played the role of a selfless helper to save the whole mine and executing his leader Chang from angry Boxers, it might be helpful to also investigate other sources to picture the event in a holistic perspective. Regarding the Chinese documental records and consecutive explanatory articles published on Ta Kung Pao by Yan Fu, the famous Chinese scholar who assisted Chang in Kaiping Mine's case and has unbiased first-hand insights, Chang is a patriarch who made the contract with Detring as a temporal compromise. The Kaiping Mine's production and transportation were severely impeded by the occupation of the eight-nation alliance in July 1900, which is the major reason accounting for its declined output as well as the motivation for Chang to seek asylum in British power as companies being investors, which is also out of the will to save the mine from completely subjecting its patrimony to Russian power. Other documents also indicate that Chang made the contract with Detring under the threat of being detained by the British embassy in Tianjin (accusation of raising pigeons to deliver messages in alliance with the Boxers), while the later business manipulations by Hoover and Moreing's company might lead to the final complete transfer in Kaiping Mine's patrimony. </p><p>The general stigma on Chang is partly the consequence of Yuan Shihkai's intention to step over modern industries and other political purposes, and the one-sided narration by Hoover who was suspected to collaboratively intrigued the business plan with the aid of British embassy powers with Detring and Moreing. Such deliberate manipulations were validated by the court decision of Chang's case ended in favor of the plaintiff. Overall, readers should take a careful judgment over the credentials of Hoover's prevailing narration on his role and initiatives in the case of Kaiping Mine.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><p>&lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114063625/http://jds.cass.cn/UploadFiles/2010/11/201011031437540630.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20170114063625/http://jds.cass.cn/UploadFiles/2010/11/201011031437540630.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://www.bradford-delong.com/2007/08/a-historical-do.html">https://www.bradford-delong.com/2007/08/a-historical-do.html</a>&gt;</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/herbert-hoover-.html">https://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/herbert-hoover-.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Fu, Yan《论中外日报论开平矿事书》16-18 April 1903, Ta Kung Pao</p><p><a href="https://www.bradford-delong.com/2007/08/a-historical-do.html">The Kaiping Mines: The Times of London, March 2, 1905, p. 9</a></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><div><hr></div><p>14) Robert Allen, <em>The British Industrial Revolution in Global Perspective</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009, &lt;https://books.google.com/?id=mc4LAQAAQBAJ&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>15) A.
