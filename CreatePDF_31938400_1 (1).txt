First of All:

Matt Yglesias: Vaccines Are Better than You Think'. a€~None of the people in the Pfizer/Moderna 
treatment groups died or even fell seriously ill and had to be hospitalizeda€!. These days they 
vaccinate kids against chickenpox, so kids mostly dona€™ t get chicken pox. But even more 
remarkable, when they do get chickenpox these days ita€™ s a a€oesick for a few daysa€D kind of 
thing not a€cemiss weeks of school while suffering in agony .a€D This is a
really big deal with regard to the lower efficacy we are expecting from the AstraZeneca and Johnson 
& Johnson vaccines. A vaccine thata€™ s only 70 percent effective at blocking infection would be 
expected to generate a larger than that reduction in hospitalizations and an even larger reduction 
in deathsa€! LINK: https://w w w.slowboring.com/p/good-vaccines

One of my favorite graphs: investment in America, showing the business cycle pattern, the 
late-cycle weakness in the high-wage 1960s and the Reagan-deficit 1980s, the anemic Obama recovery, 
and the large one-time jump in the real investment share in the Clinton yearsa€”one-third due to 
Clinton budget policy, one-third due to the falling price of high-tech investment goods, one-third 
due to the dot-com boom

I would note the remarkable success of the Clinton administration program of 1993 in generating a 
high-investment recovery: boosting the real/real share of investment in America from 13% to 17%. I 
would note the failure of both the Bush-First-Hastert and the Trump-McConnell-Ryan tax cuts to do 
anything analogousa€”even though they were sold as bigger deals. We Democratic economists are 
professional economists: we know stuff. They Republican
economists are professional^ I Republicans. Rely on them for anything about the world and you will, 
more likely than not, wind up naked on the Moon.

MacBookAirs, i-5s, & Mis

Looks like a picked the wrong season (i.e., last spring, 2020) to update my MacBookAir

In fact, if there was a worse moment that I could have decided to update my machine from the 
perspective of the technological gradient missed by upgrading then as opposed to waiting six 
months, I do not know what it could have been.

All I can plead is that, at the time, it was (a) clear that to run zoom and its ilk effectively and 
efficiently at the pace it then looked as though I would need to for at least the late spring and 
summer of 2020,1 needed a processor with more horsepower than thea€! Intel core 14 
nm-processi5-5350U Broadwella€! I then had; (b)Intel did not seem likely to be willing to offer 
Apple much more and better soonin mobile processors, for the performance gap between the
10 nm-process i5-1030NG7 I got and the top-line i7-1060NG7 seemed quite small; and (c) the 
i5-1030NG7 Ice Lake was itself a very substantial bump up from the Broadwell. I had no idea back 
then that the Ml would turn out to be the absolute beast it has turned out to be.

So I went from a Geekbench multicore of 1355 to 2873a€”not too shabby for 2.5 years, even by a 
old-days Moorea€™ s law standard. And do not get me wrong: it is a machine that does not choke and 
die under the load of doing zoom and two other things. But, still, my CPU is always at more than 
60% usewith the fan always running at high and, I bet, its power throttled back. And zoom, the 
window server, the video-content sandboxer, and bird are reliably
soaking up three of the four Ice Lake cores all be themselves.

And I look to my left, and I see that if I had waited six months for the Ml, I could have gone not 
from 1355 to 2873 but from 1355 to 7341a€!

onto advocates of the rival positional. [She] isna€™t given a fair chance to make her case for this 
position. Instead, shea€™ s forced to earn the right to make the
case by acquitting herself of the implicit charge that she is a petty tyrant policing mind-crimes

an evasive maneuver than a coherent ideaa€l.

ideologya€l. Ideologya€’’that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the

Americans of their racial, cultural, and economic primacy a€’’fusing racial anxiety with resentment 
of feminism, gay rights, secularism, immigration, and the
genuine ravages of globalism, wage stagnation, and declining opportunitya€I. Making America great 
again meant reasserting their dominance in a country degraded by diversity.

Racial and political violence increased; firearms proliferated; disorder at Black Lives Matter 
protests aroused a bigoted vigilantism which Trumpa€™ s rhetoric encouraged. The toxins of racial 
and cultural animus suffused the would-be lynch mob which seized the seat of government in a 
demented effort to restore Trumpa€”and themselvesa€”to their rightful place. So did a related

conflate Trump with Jesus Christa€l. It is far too little to say that the GOP has lost its way.
