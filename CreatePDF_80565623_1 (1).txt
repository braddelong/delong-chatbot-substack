Friday’s Child Is Loving and Giving



UTOPIA

AN ECONOMIC HISTORY
OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY

J. BRADFORD DELONG

Why did I get this book?

Ia€™ ve been in overlapping blogspace with Brad DeLong for quite a while, including his Substack, 
so that alone was reason enougha€”Ia€™ ve always enjoyed what he writes. But ita€™ s also pertinent 
to the book I mentioned in the newsletter a while ago (the one that Ia€™ m going to try and find a 
publisher for soon after one more round of revision), so I will probably try to work it into that 
revision.

Is it what I thought it was?

In certain ways, actually not. Ita€™ s completely what I expected in one sense, in that it is very 
recognizably DeLonga€™ s thinking laid out in long form. In another sense (see more below), I 
thought the subtitle maybe should have been An Economists™ s History of the Twentieth Century, in 
that it often does not closely cohere to some of the constraints common in what I expect to see in 
economic history as a subgenre within the discipline of history. A
substantial amount of the book is actually about politics, relatively unleavened by direct 
reference to underlying economics or economic institutions.

What continuing uses might I have for it?

There are some parts Ia€™ d like to go over again, especially in the last third of the book, and I 
could see reading some of it in future versions of my course on world history as a genre as well as 
some other possible courses.

A lot of the economic history I read stays fairly far inside the lines of what we conventionally 
define as a€ceeconomica€D. It may stray into what is also meant by political economy in the sense 
of talking about how political and even social structures affected economic structures and economic 
practices. A lot of this book is straight-up (and very engaging) commentary on formal politics, on 
political events like wars or interstate conflicts, and on social and
cultural changes where DeLong is only very generally linking his description and explanation of 
those histories to some form of highly generalized economic causality, usually to a view that a 
series of interlinked changes after 1870 began a Soeslouch towards utopiaa€D which was at times a 
bit more of a rapid walk which inflected into all other global developments after that date. It is, 
in any event, a compulsively readable book that intermixes some very
familiar individuals and incidents (I propose a total ban on Tesla for a while in all books of this 
kind) with some unfamiliar ones (DeLong does a nice job weaving Hoover through a lot of the first 
third of the book, most particularly aspects of his career that probably arena€™ t known to most 
people).

I think in any event that telling modern history from an eclectic economists™ s point-of-view

quibbles will exist in plenitude and invites readers to come over and quibble on the record at his 
Substack. (Ia€™ ve avoided looking at those until I finished my own reading.)

Ia€™ 11 start with a big and abstract objection that is not limited to DeLong, which is the 
characterization that many economists and allied thinkers have been lately rather bullish about the 
view that we live in a world of unimaginable wealth and in fact are doing rather well at responding 
to the needs of humanity. This book doesna€™ t drink that Kool-Aid as hard as some folks havea€”the 
title gets its full realization in the last third of the book or so, where
DeLong chronicles how neoliberalism seems to have been the prologue to a a€oenew storya€D which 
will need a a€oenew grand narrativeSD, one which is not merely a momentary downturn or interruption 
but which threatens to knock us off the path to utopia altogether.

My problem with this characterization whenever I come across it is first that it more or less makes 
the entirety of premodern economic history into an undifferentiated blob of bleak and unrelenting 
poverty that matters only as a source of contrast to modernity (whether that is dated to 1650,1789 
or 1870). Quite frequently, it is also offered as a benediction to our unequal present (which is 
not DeLonga€™ s argument)a€’’essentially an argument that people should
stop complaining so much about inequality and injustice because theya€™ ve got it so good compared 
to most human beings in most of history. I dona€™ t object to that view because Ia€™ m sentimental 
about the material conditions in past societies, I object to it because inequality and poverty are 
mostly a relative rather than absolute concern.

Leta€™ s suppose that a year from now a lab completely cracks the problem of molecular-scale 
nanotechnology and is able to cheaply and easily rearrange matter at small and large scales, 
producing a genuinely post-scarcity society. Replicators ahoy! Earl Grey, hot! First off a 
technology capable of abolishing scarcity does not mean the abolition of scarcity because other 
forces intervene to keep it from doing soa€”a point that gets a lot of attention in
DeLonga€™ s book. But leta€™ s suppose that even that is overcome and everybody from a rural farmer 
in Zambia to a government minister in Albania has personal nanotech and therea€™ s no worries about 
turning the planet into grey goo. Would the future Brad DeLong write about how ridiculously poor 
everyone was in 2022? By an absolute standard, that would be an accurate characterization. But 
right now, wea€™re not ridiculously poor by that
standard because it doesna€™t exist. It may be that ordinary farmers living under the rule of the 
Mwenemutapa state in what is now Zimbabwe in 1560 and even the royal court of that state are in 
absolute terms ridiculously poor compared to all modern Zimbabweans, and that farmers in the 
southeastern lowveld of Zimbabwe today are enormously wealthy in material terms compared to people 
living there four centuries ago, but ita€™ s kind of a nonsense
comparison when it comes to how people experience their material culture. If everybodya€™ s 
poora€”and therea€™ s no option to be as rich as we are nowa€”then our judgment that theya€™ re 
living horrible lives is irrelevant in that time frame. Our wealth wasna€™ t an option for them. 
Equally, a poor farmer by relative terms in that part of Zimbabwe is poora€”and in fact is more 
dramatically poor compared to the richest Zimbabweans, let alone the
richest Americans, than anything that anyone in the world in 1560 could have envisioned. Having 
access to manufactured clothing, some processed food, and fitfully provided or available education 
and health care does not make those people rich except by comparison to long dead people except in 
some kind of a€~objectivea€™ bookkeeping.

Moving along to the main substance of the book, in a more situated kind of argument, I was a bit 
surprised at DeLonga€™ s relative reluctance to grapple with racism and empire. He doesna€™t leave 
it out by any means, but the Occama€™ s Razor version of explaining inequality, especially racial 
inequality, as a deliberately constructed economic system, seems to me something he steps around a 
fair amount.

Being focused on the twentieth century, even a a€celonga€D version that stretches from 1870 to 
2022, is maybe a valid way to wiggle out of having to get into the relationship between the 
Atlantic slave trade (or the intensification of global trade generally in the early modern era) and 
industrial capitalism, though he actually has quite a lot to say about this much later in the book 
in his discussion of postwar economic development in the global South.
Nevertheless, the a€oenew imperialism^□ that ramped up in 1870 is squarely in the wheelhouse of 
this book. Therea€™ s a chapter devoted to the subject and it comes up a fair amount in the first 
third of the book generally, but empire gets folded into war and nationalism as things that a 
classic liberal economist prior to 1914 might see as unexpected atavisms that produced woefully 
unoptimal outcomes and might be expected to disappear in a truly market-
driven global order. (Echoes of which still pop up in far-right libertarian thought, where the 
belief is sometimes put forward that violence, interstate competition, etc. will be priced out as 
unoptimal behavior as soon as we are in a world where every household stands on its own property 
and is armed in its own defense.)

DeLong knows that Schumpeter, Hobson, etc. were not only proven wrong but that they simply werena€™ 
t understanding what empire (and later nationalism and global war) were all about. But Ia€™ m not 
sure he actually advances an alternative explanation except to say that the a€oeMr. Hydea€D side of 
Hayekian thought wanted market systems to increase    the wealth of thosewho held valuable 
propertyrights, andwhether that outcome was in any sense
or fair was beside the point. The heart of how property rights were conferred to invaders and 
settlers on a global scale (including the ownership of people) is set in the time before the 20th 
Century, but formal empire after 1870 is at least a continuation of that story.

Sometimes European colonial administrations were complicated mediating mechanisms in the creation 
of new property rights, even sometimes conferring those rights on colonial subjectsa€”the classic 
example in my field is the way that cocoa cultivation in West Africa, especially Ghana, involved a 
relatively decentralized conferral of new forms of land tenure    on local African patriarchswho 
actively embraced accumulating capital through producing coco
world markets. In other cases, it was unconstrained thefta€’’Leopold II and the owners of other 
concessionary companies in Central Africa allotting themselves the rights to profits from rubber, 
ivory and other commodities produced through forced labor. Even in those cases where Europeans 
eventually left physically, the orientation of those extractive economies remained intact, and the 
racialization of access to the combination of features that DeLong seesas

the key to a€oeescaping the Malthusian trapa€D in the slow-walk to utopia was often explicit not 
just at the outset of empire but all along. If economists are puzzled by why the British Raj did 
not engender transformation, theya€™re maybe not paying attention. (But of course some 
havea€’’Amartya Sen has a pretty good intuition about the reason, for example.)

Ia€™ 11 give a good detailed example that I know fairly well in my own area of specialization. When 
I was deep in my dissertation work on changes in the lives of southern African consumers between 
1870 and 1970,1 was becoming very alive to what DeLonga€™ s grand narrative sets out, almost 
against my wishes, coming from a fairly hard-left perspective at the time.    I was seeing that the 
material worlds of local people were suddenly overflowing with
kinds of commodities that both replaced locally made goods and offered entirely new categories of 
material life, and that what had been wants were rapidly changing into felt needs.

One of the realizations which surprised me was also affecting other social and cultural historians 
working on the region, which is that between about 1850 and 1910, many young African men were quite 
voluntarily drawn towards engaging in wage labor in new mines, in sugar plantations, and as 
domestic workers. Keletso Atkinsa€™ The Moon Is Dead and Patrick Harriesa€™ Work, Culture and 
Identity were only a few of the monographs and articles to show
that the market as a concept wasna€™t regarded as an alien intrusion on a perfectly formed moral 
economy. For many young men, the idea of working in order to earn either currency or commodity 
payments sufficient to establish themselves as materially well-off in their home communities, 
especially as able to independently buy cattle in local markets, was a welcome prospect. That 
allowed them to do an end-run around generational transmission of wealth
that kept them dependent on their fathers and uncles for the payment of bridewealth. But the point 
of that labor was only to work as long as necessary to cheat those local hierarchies, and no 
longer, not to enter into a lifetime of competitive accumulation designed to rival the ventures of 
new plantation owners or the consolidating owners of diamond and then gold diggings. (Though there 
were African men digging equally alongside the rest of the planet in the
initial rush for diamonds around Kimberley.)

The new plantation owners and then the consolidators of mineral digs were tapping into circuits of 
capital far away from southern Africa, but they were also relying very much on imperial states to 
make good their theft of land from indigenous communities. None of them were buying deeds from the 
people who had lived there before. But more importantly, they werena€™t going to take advantage of 
an openness to market relations in order to properly
incentivize local men to continue and extend their participation in wage labor, because that would 
have cost too much from the perspective of men who wanted to accumulate capital that was comparable 
to the wealth of metropolitan investors and owners. So they used racial restrictions, petty 
taxation that was only payable in currency, and a massive scale of land alienation that transferred 
the best agrarian land to exclusively white owners in order to try and
compel African workers to work for as long as mine owners and plantation owners needed them to 
work, not as long as the workers themselves wanted in terms of satisfying their own needs.

When Africans were in danger of competing economically with white settlers within the agricultural 
economy, colonial administrations stepped into overtly sabotage that competition with regulatory 
interventions. For example, in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), when Cecil Rhodesa€™ promise of a 
a€oesecond Randa€D to his London investors and his a€cepioneera€D settlers crapped out, the 
company-led state turned instead to promising white settlers
cheap land and cheap labor to grow valuable crops like tobacco. But one of the locally valuable 
crops that was easiest to grow first was maize, which everyone needed and wanted as a part of their 
dieta€”and African farmers living near to the three biggest colonial cities were highly efficient 
at growing it, with low overheads. Settler farmers complained, and the government passed a Maize 
Control Act that required African farmers to sell their maize at an
artificially fixed high price that let white farmers undercut them and still make enough money in 
the process that they could reinvest in higher-profit crops and cattle herding.

This may seem like a long digression, but ita€™ s important I think for the economic history of the 
twentieth century. If a€oelaboratory, the corporation, global transportation, global 
communications, and falling barriersaCn were a big part of the kick-off after 1870 (along with 
education, which DeLong frequently sees as important), Ia€™ d argue that so was the national 
mobilization of violence to suppress the power of labor and through empire to create
valuable property rights through theft which were conferred on a racially exclusive basis long 
enough to structure a lasting global inequality. The Maize Control Acts and their ilk were repeated 
thousands of times throughout the non-Western world between 1870 and 1970. Ita€™ s something DeLong 
himself gets at in his chapter on a€ceinclusiona€D in thinking about race relations in the United 
States, but the story seems weirdly discontinuous somehow.

The a€oeman starts on third base, thinks he hit a triplea€D is not a metaphor in this case, ita€™ s 
an empirical reality. Whatever laboratories, corporations, technology, education and the management 
of global-scale exchange enabled in terms of changing the material conditions of global humanity, 
it seems pertinent to note that the commodities and services which flowed back into Europea€™ s 
imperial possessions in some sense resembling stuffing an envelope
full of dollar bills under a door to a person whose life savings you just stole. a€ceCatching upa€D 
takes more than surgically repairing a hamstring you inflicted on half the runners at the beginning 
of the marathon. It just feels as if the book as a whole takes much of the a€oeglobal Southa€D in 
the economic history of the 20th Century as an edge case when it seems to me to be central to 
explaining not just half the planeta€™ s economic history but the

economic history of the whole. I cana€™ t imagine that laboratories, corporations, technology, 
education and falling barriers would return the same 20th Century if half the planet had magically 
disappeared in 1870s and the global North was left spinning through space intact on its own.

I do not think in fact that a€oethe struggle over systems wasa€!carried out in and near the global 
northaCD as exclusively as DeLong argues. It may be that I choose other vignettes than he does but 
Ia€™ d like to think my choices arena€™ t cherry-picking but are instead pretty representative. The 
situation of the global South isna€™ t about the absence of the conditions for growth, it is that 
the global South was integrated into globalization through empire,
violence and racial hierarchy, and that a fair amount of the unequal distribution of modern capital 
derives from the organized transfer of resources, land and labor from the people who had those to 
people who stole them on the grounds that the previous owners werena€™ t doing enough to create 
value with what they had.

Another thing that surprised me somewhat is that DeLong has relatively little to say (as an overall 
percentage of the book) about the notable changes after 1870 and then even more so after 1929 in 
how nation-states related to the economy, and the rise of the idea that the management of economies 
through expert intervention is one of the central functions of nations. The subject certainly gets 
a fair amount of treatment, especially as one would expect through
attention to Keynes, but it just seems to me to be one of the astonishing differences about the 
a€oelong twentieth centurya€D from all that came before ita€”the relative amateurishness of 
economic management in the mid-19th Century and even (perhaps especially) at the cusp of the Great 
Depression is pretty astonishing by later standards. At least some of the wealth created between 
1870-1900 in the United States had something to do with the extent to which
government barely knew what the hell was going on with markets, companies or the economy, as Greg 
Steinmetza€™ new book on Jay Gould points out.

One other thing that I kept turning over in my head is that for a history that is quite aware of 
the recurrence of certain kinds of eventsa€’’speculative panics, depressions, inflation (caused by 
monetary policy or otherwise), predatory transfer-seeking or corruption, wars that in some sense 
made no a€~rationala€™ sense, etc., therea€™ s a recurrent interest in turning to serendipity, 
accident and randomness as explanation, or a€oebad luck and bad choicesa€D.
Perhaps because more structural explanations of at least some of those seeming patterns unbalances 
the booka€™ s desire to walk between Polanyi and Hayek and to see the economic history of the 20th 
Century as also balanced between them. If one were to conclude that market economies predictably 
favor certain kinds of a€oebad choicesa€da€’’perhaps actively enable thema€”then thata€™ s more 
than Polanyia€™ s thought that the market cana€™ t
satisfy   all human needs for justice and fairness, ita€™ s that marketsa€”or more abstractly 
capitalisma€”have an attractor towards empirically bad outcomes. I suppose thata€™ s another reason 
something in me is unsatisfied by the idea that we have been slouching towards utopia, even if that 
slow walk is possibly coming to an end as DeLong sees ita€”it is precisely that the material 
abundance of the post-1870 world is so short and episodic against the longue
duree of human history. Ita€™ s as if a team is declaring theya€™ ve won the Super Bowl after 
winning the first game of the season.

Even in the long twentieth century, there have been so many a€oebad choicesa€D that they hardly 
seem like accidents, and yet it is at that point that DeLong insists (whether talking about 
politics or economics) that the explanations of bad choices are local, particular, specific to a 
country, a political moment, or an individual leader. a€oeUtopian faith is a helluva druga€D, 
DeLong writes, and I think he kind of knows that there are times in the book where
hea€™ s getting high on his own supply. But it also maybe reflects the extent to which some aspect 
of his faith in our slow walk to utopia is as much about liberalism as it is economicsa€.”tha.t it 
is crucial to him to see both the dangers and the achievements of the 20th Century as frequently 
being the consequence of good and bad choices that could have been made differently rather than the 
inexorably determined outcomes of underlying economic systems and
structures.

Anyway, this is me being feisty and maybe even nit-picky about a book that I enjoyed and found 
engaginga€”I think many readers would find it as good a history of 20th Century politics in a very 
accessible and punchy way as it is of economies and economic policya€”and I also like to take a 
puff or two of the desire to see our times as having the possibilities of utopia embedded within 
them and to think, with great dread, that we have crossed a boundary where
those possibilities are going to fall away from us with accelerating speed.

material life, and that what had been wants were rapidly changing into felt needs.

One of the realizations which surprised me was also affecting other social and cultural historians 
working on the region, which is that between about 1850 and 1910, many young African men were quite 
voluntarily drawn towards engaging in wage labor in new mines, in sugar plantations, and as 
domestic workers. Keletso Atkinsa€™ The Moon Is Dead and Patrick Harriesa€™ Work, Culture and 
Identity were only a few of the monographs and articles to show
that the market as a concept wasna€™t regarded as an alien intrusion on a perfectly formed moral 
economy. For many young men, the idea of working in order to earn either currency or commodity 
payments sufficient to establish themselves as materially well-off in their home communities, 
especially as able to independently buy cattle in local markets, was a welcome prospect. That 
allowed them to do an end-run around generational transmission of wealth
that kept them dependent on their fathers and uncles for the payment of bridewealth. But the point 
of that labor was only to work as long as necessary to cheat those local hierarchies, and no 
longer, not to enter into a lifetime of competitive accumulation designed to rival the ventures of 
new plantation owners or the consolidating owners of diamond and then gold diggings. (Though there 
were African men digging equally alongside the rest of the planet in the
initial rush for diamonds around Kimberley.)

The new plantation owners and then the consolidators of mineral digs were tapping into circuits of 
capital far away from southern Africa, but they were also relying very much on imperial states to 
make good their theft of land from indigenous communities. None of them were buying deeds from the 
people who had lived there before. But more importantly, they werena€™t going to take advantage of 
an openness to market relations in order to properly
incentivize local men to continue and extend their participation in wage labor, because that would 
have cost too much from the perspective of men who wanted to accumulate capital that was comparable 
to the wealth of metropolitan investors and owners. So they used racial restrictions, petty 
taxation that was only payable in currency, and a massive scale of land alienation that transferred 
the best agrarian land to exclusively white owners in order to try and
compel African workers to work for as long as mine owners and plantation owners needed them to 
work, not as long as the workers themselves wanted in terms of satisfying their own needs.

When Africans were in danger of competing economically with white settlers within the agricultural 
economy, colonial administrations stepped into overtly sabotage that competition with regulatory 
interventions. For example, in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), when Cecil Rhodesa€™ promise of a 
a€oesecond Randa€D to his London investors and his a€cepioneera€D settlers crapped out, the 
company-led state turned instead to promising white settlers
cheap land and cheap labor to grow valuable crops like tobacco. But one of the locally valuable 
crops that was easiest to grow first was maize, which everyone needed and wanted as a part of their 
dieta€”and African farmers living near to the three biggest colonial cities were highly efficient 
at growing it, with low overheads. Settler farmers complained, and the government passed a Maize 
Control Act that required African farmers to sell their maize at an
artificially fixed high price that let white farmers undercut them and still make enough money in 
the process that they could reinvest in higher-profit crops and cattle herding.

This may seem like a long digression, but ita€™ s important I think for the economic history of the 
twentieth century. If a€oelaboratory, the corporation, global transportation, global 
communications, and falling barriersaCn were a big part of the kick-off after 1870 (along with 
education, which DeLong frequently sees as important), Ia€™ d argue that so was the national 
mobilization of violence to suppress the power of labor and through empire to create
valuable property rights through theft which were conferred on a racially exclusive basis long 
enough to structure a lasting global inequality. The Maize Control Acts and their ilk were repeated 
thousands of times throughout the non-Western world between 1870 and 1970. Ita€™ s something DeLong 
himself gets at in his chapter on a€ceinclusiona€D in thinking about race relations in the United 
States, but the story seems weirdly discontinuous somehow.

The a€oeman starts on third base, thinks he hit a triplea€D is not a metaphor in this case, ita€™ s 
an empirical reality. Whatever laboratories, corporations, technology, education and the management 
of global-scale exchange enabled in terms of changing the material conditions of global humanity, 
it seems pertinent to note that the commodities and services which flowed back into Europea€™ s 
imperial possessions in some sense resembling stuffing an envelope
full of dollar bills under a door to a person whose life savings you just stole. a€ceCatching upa€D 
takes more than surgically repairing a hamstring you inflicted on half the runners at the beginning 
of the marathon. It just feels as if the book as a whole takes much of the a€oeglobal Southa€D in 
the economic history of the 20th Century as an edge case when it seems to me to be central to 
explaining not just half the planeta€™ s economic history but the

economic history of the whole. I cana€™ t imagine that laboratories, corporations, technology, 
education and falling barriers would return the same 20th Century if half the planet had magically 
disappeared in 1870s and the global North was left spinning through space intact on its own.

I do not think in fact that a€oethe struggle over systems wasa€!carried out in and near the global 
northaCD as exclusively as DeLong argues. It may be that I choose other vignettes than he does but 
Ia€™ d like to think my choices arena€™ t cherry-picking but are instead pretty representative. The 
situation of the global South isna€™ t about the absence of the conditions for growth, it is that 
the global South was integrated into globalization through empire,
violence and racial hierarchy, and that a fair amount of the unequal distribution of modern capital 
derives from the organized transfer of resources, land and labor from the people who had those to 
people who stole them on the grounds that the previous owners werena€™ t doing enough to create 
value with what they had.

Another thing that surprised me somewhat is that DeLong has relatively little to say (as an overall 
percentage of the book) about the notable changes after 1870 and then even more so after 1929 in 
how nation-states related to the economy, and the rise of the idea that the management of economies 
through expert intervention is one of the central functions of nations. The subject certainly gets 
a fair amount of treatment, especially as one would expect through
attention to Keynes, but it just seems to me to be one of the astonishing differences about the 
a€oelong twentieth centurya€D from all that came before ita€”the relative amateurishness of 
economic management in the mid-19th Century and even (perhaps especially) at the cusp of the Great 
Depression is pretty astonishing by later standards. At least some of the wealth created between 
1870-1900 in the United States had something to do with the extent to which
government barely knew what the hell was going on with markets, companies or the economy, as Greg 
Steinmetza€™ new book on Jay Gould points out.

One other thing that I kept turning over in my head is that for a history that is quite aware of 
the recurrence of certain kinds of eventsa€’’speculative panics, depressions, inflation (caused by 
monetary policy or otherwise), predatory transfer-seeking or corruption, wars that in some sense 
made no a€~rationala€™ sense, etc., therea€™ s a recurrent interest in turning to serendipity, 
accident and randomness as explanation, or a€oebad luck and bad choicesa€D.
Perhaps because more structural explanations of at least some of those seeming patterns unbalances 
the booka€™ s desire to walk between Polanyi and Hayek and to see the economic history of the 20th 
Century as also balanced between them. If one were to conclude that market economies predictably 
favor certain kinds of a€oebad choicesa€da€’’perhaps actively enable thema€”then thata€™ s more 
than Polanyia€™ s thought that the market cana€™ t
satisfy   all human needs for justice and fairness, ita€™ s that marketsa€”or more abstractly 
capitalisma€”have an attractor towards empirically bad outcomes. I suppose thata€™ s another reason 
something in me is unsatisfied by the idea that we have been slouching towards utopia, even if that 
slow walk is possibly coming to an end as DeLong sees ita€”it is precisely that the material 
abundance of the post-1870 world is so short and episodic against the longue
duree of human history. Ita€™ s as if a team is declaring theya€™ ve won the Super Bowl after 
winning the first game of the season.

Even in the long twentieth century, there have been so many a€oebad choicesa€D that they hardly 
seem like accidents, and yet it is at that point that DeLong insists (whether talking about 
politics or economics) that the explanations of bad choices are local, particular, specific to a 
country, a political moment, or an individual leader. a€oeUtopian faith is a helluva druga€D, 
DeLong writes, and I think he kind of knows that there are times in the book where
hea€™ s getting high on his own supply. But it also maybe reflects the extent to which some aspect 
of his faith in our slow walk to utopia is as much about liberalism as it is economicsa€.”tha.t it 
is crucial to him to see both the dangers and the achievements of the 20th Century as frequently 
being the consequence of good and bad choices that could have been made differently rather than the 
inexorably determined outcomes of underlying economic systems and
structures.

Anyway, this is me being feisty and maybe even nit-picky about a book that I enjoyed and found 
engaginga€”I think many readers would find it as good a history of 20th Century politics in a very 
accessible and punchy way as it is of economies and economic policya€”and I also like to take a 
puff or two of the desire to see our times as having the possibilities of utopia embedded within 
them and to think, with great dread, that we have crossed a boundary where
those possibilities are going to fall away from us with accelerating speed.
