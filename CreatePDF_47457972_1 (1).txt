Virginia-style American nationalism is: No damned government is ever going to tell me what I can 
and cannot do, no way, no how!

Leta€™ s give the mic to Patrick a€oeGive me liberty, or give me death!a€D Henry, to see the kind 
of liberty he wanteda€”and what kind of a€oeinfringementa€n of liberty he feared from the federal 
government if the Constitution were to be ratified:

Patrick Henry: June 24,1788:

[The federal government] may, if we be engaged in war, liberate every one of your slaves if they 
please. And this must and will be done by men, a majority of whom have not a common interest with 
youa€!. If they give power to the general government to provide for the general defence, the means 
must be commensurate to the enda€!. In this state there are two hundred and thirty-six thousand 
blacksa€!. But there are few or none in the

of this last war? We were not so hard pushed as to make emancipation general; but acts of Assembly 
passed that every slave who would go to the army should be free.

Another thing will contribute to bring this event about. Slavery is detesteda€!. Let that urbanity,

The full speech:

Jonathan Elliot (1888): The Debates in the Several State Conventions: Virginia: a€~Mr. [PATRICK] 
HENRY, after observing that the proposal of ratification was premature, and that the importance of 
the subject required the most mature deliberation, proceeded thus:

The honorable member must forgive me for declaring my dissent from it; because, if I understand it 
rightly, it admits that the new system is defective, and most capitally; for, immediately after the 
proposed ratification, there comes a declaration that the paper before you is not intended to 
violate any of these three great rights a€” the liberty of religion, liberty of the press, and the 
trial by jury. What is the inference


when you enumerate the rights which you are to enjoy? That those not enumerated are relinquished. 
There are only three things to be retained a€” religion, freedom of the press, and jury trial.

Will not the ratification carry every thing, without excepting these three things ? Will not all 
the world pronounce that we intended to give up all the rest? Every thing it speaks of, by way of 
rights, is comprised in these things. Your subsequent amendments only go to these three amendments.

I feel myself distressed, because the necessity of securing our personal rights seems not to have 
pervaded the minds of men; for many other valuable things are omitted: a€” for instance, general 
warrants, by which an officer may search suspected places, without evidence of the commission of a 
fact, or seize any person without evidence of his crime, ought to be prohibited. As these are 
admitted, any man may be
seized, any property may be taken, in the most arbitrary manner, without any evidence or reason. 
Every thing the most sacred may be searched and ransacked by the strong hand of power. We have 
infinitely more reason to dread general warrants here than they have in England, because there, if 
a person be confined, liberty may be quickly obtained by the writ of habeas corpus. But here a man 
living many hundred
miles from the judges may get in prison before he can get that writ.

Another most fatal omission is with respect to standing armies. In our bill of rights of Virginia, 
they are said to be dangerous to liberty, and it tells you that the proper defence of a free state 
consists in militia; and so I might go on to ten or eleven things of immense consequence secured in 
your bill of rights, concerning which that proposal is silent. Is that the language of the bill of 
rights in England? Is it the
language of the American bill of rights, that these three rights, and these only, are valuable? Is 
it the language of men going into a new government? Is it not necessary to speak of those things 
before you go into a compact?

How do these three things stand? As one of the parties, we declare we do not mean to give them up. 
This is very dictatorial a€” much more so than the conduct which proposes alterations as the 
condition of adoption. In a compact there are two parties a€” one excepting, and another proposing. 
As a party, we propose that we shall secure these three things; and before we have the assent of 
the other contracting
party, we go into the compact, and leave these things at then mercy.

What will be the consequence? Suppose the other states shall call this dictatorial. They will say, 
Virginia has gone into the government, and carried with her certain propositions, which, she says, 
ought to be concurred in by the other states. They will declare that she has no right to dictate to 
other states the conditions on which they shall come into the Union. According to the honorable 
member's proposal, the
ratification will cease to be obligatory unless they accede to these amendments. We have ratified 
it. You have committed a violation, will they say. They have not violated it. We say, we will go 
out of it.

You are then reduced to a sad dilemma a€” to give up these three rights, or leave the government. 
This is worse than our present Confederation, to which we have hitherto adhered honestly and 
faithfully. We shall be told we have violated it, because we have left it for the infringement and 
violation of conditions which they never agreed to be a part of the ratification. The ratification 
will be complete. The proposal
is made by the party. We, as the other, accede to it, and propose the security of these three great 
rights; for it is only a proposal. In order to secure them, you are left in that state of fatal 
hostility which I shall as much deplore as the honorable gentleman. I exhort gentlemen to think 
seriously before they ratify this Constitution, and persuade themselves that they will succeed in 
making a feeble effort to get
amendments after adoption.

With respect to that part of the proposal which says that every power not granted remains with the 
people, it must be previous to adoption, or it will involve this country in inevitable destruction. 
To talk of it as a thing subsequent, not as one of your unalienable rights, is leaving it to the 
casual opinion of the Congress who shall take up the consideration of that matter. They will not 
reason with you about the effect
of this Constitution. They will not take the opinion of this committee concerning its operation. 
They will construe it as they please.

If you place it subsequently, let me ask the consequences. Among ten thousand implied powers which 
they may assume, they may, if we be engaged in war, liberate every one of your slaves if they 
please. And this must and will be done by men, a majority of whom have not a common interest with 
you. They will, therefore, have no feeling of your interests. It has been repeatedly said here, 
that the great object of
a national government was national defence. That power which is said to be intended for security 
and safety may be rendered detestable and oppressive. If they give power to the general government 
to provide for the general defence, the means must be commensurate to the end. All the means in the 
possession of the people must be given to the government which is intrusted with the public 
defence.

In this state there are two hundred and thirty-six thousand blacks, and there are many in several 
other states. But there are few or none in the Northern States; and yet, if the Northern States 
shall be of opinion that our slaves are numberless, they may call forth every national resource. 
May Congress not say, that every black man must fight? Did we not see a little of this last war? We 
were not so hard pushed as to
make emancipation general; but acts of Assembly passed that every slave who would go to the army 
should be free.

Another thing will contribute to bring this event about. Slavery is detested. We feel its fatal 
effects a€” we deplore it with all the pity of humanity. Let all these considerations, at some 
future period, press with full force on the minds of Congress. Let that urbanity, which I trust 
will distinguish America, and the necessity of national defence,a€” let all these things operate on 
their minds; they will search that paper,
and see if they have power of manumission. And have they not, sir.? Have they not power to provide 
for the general defence and welfare? May they not think that these call for the abolition of 
slavery ? May they not pronounce all slaves free, and will they not be warranted by that power?

This is no ambiguous implication or logical deduction. The paper speaks to the point: they have the 
power in clear, unequivocal terms, and will clearly and certainly exercise it. As much as I deplore 
slavery, I see that prudence forbids its abolition. I deny that the general government ought to set 
them free, because a decided majority of the states have not the ties of sympathy and 
fellow-feeling for those whose
interest would be affected by their emancipation. The majority of Congress is to the north, and the 
slaves are to the south.

In this situation, I see a great deal of the property of the people of Virginia in jeopardy, and 
their peace and tranquility gone. I repeat it again, that it would rejoice my very soul that every 
one of my fellow-beings was emancipated. As we ought with gratitude to admire that decree of Heaven 
which has numbered us among the free, we ought to lament and deplore the necessity of holding our 
fellow-men in bondage.
But is it practicable, by any human means, to liberate them without producing the most dreadful and 
ruinous consequences? We ought to possess them in the manner we inherited them from our ancestors, 
as their manumission is incompatible with the felicity of our country. But we ought to soften, as 
much as possible, the rigor of their unhappy fate.

I know that, in a variety of particular instances, the legislature, listening to complaints, have 
admitted their emancipation. Let me not dwell on this subject. I will only add that this, as well 
as every other property of the people of Virginia, is in jeopardy, and put in the hands of those 
who have no similarity of situation with us. This is a local matter, and I can see no propriety in 
subjecting it to Congress.

With respect to subsequent amendments, proposed by the worthy member, I am distressed when I hear 
the expression. It is a new one altogether, and such a one as stands against every idea of 
fortitude and manliness in the states, or any one else. Evils admitted in order to be removed 
subsequently, and tyranny submitted to in order to be excluded by a subsequent alteration, are 
things totally new to me. But I am
sure the gentleman meant nothing but to amuse the committee. I know his candor. His proposal is an 
idea dreadful to me. I ask, does experience warrant such a thing from the beginning of the world to 
this day? Do you enter into a compact first, and afterwards settle the terms of the government? It 
is admitted by every one that this is a compact.

Although the Confederation be lost, it is a compact, constitution, or something of that nature. I 
confess I never heard of such an idea before. It is most abhorrent to my mind. You endanger the 
tranquillity of your country, you stab its repose, if you accept this government unaltered. How are 
you to allay animosities? a€” for such there are, great and fatal.

He flatters me, and tells me that I could influence the people, and reconcile them to it. Sir, 
their sentiments are as firm and steady as they are patriotic. Were I to ask them to apostatize 
from their native religion, they would despise me. They are not to be shaken in their opinions with 
respect to the propriety of preserving their rights. You never can persuade them that it is 
necessary to relinquish them. Were I to
attempt to persuade them to abandon their patriotic sentiments, I should look on myself as the most 
in-famous of men.

I believe it to be a fact that the great body of yeomanry are in decided opposition to it. I may 
say with confidence that, for nineteen counties adjacent to each other, nine-tenths of the people 
are conscientiously opposed to it. I may be mistaken, but I give you it as my opinion; and my 
opinion is founded on personal knowledge, in some measure, and other good authority. I have not 
hunted popularity by declaiming
to injure this government. Though public fame might say so, it was not owing to me that this flame 
of opposition has been kindled and spread. These men never will part with their political opinions. 
If they should see their political happiness secured to the latest posterity, then, indeed, they 
may agree to it. Subsequent amendments will not do for men of this cast. Do you consult the Union 
in proposing them? You
may amuse them as long as you please, but they will never like it. You have not solid reality a€” 
the hearts and hands of the men who are to be governed.

Have gentlemen no respect to the actual dispositions of the people in the adopting states? Look at 
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. These two great states have raised as great objections to that 
government as we do. There was a majority of only nineteen in Massachusetts. We are told that only 
ten thousand were represented in Pennsylvania, although seventy thousand had a right to be 
represented. Is not this a
serious thing? Is it not worth while to turn your eyes, for a moment, from subsequent amendments to 
the situation of your country? Can you have a lasting union in these circumstances? It will be in 
vain to expect it.

But if you agree to previous amendments, you shall have union, firm and solid.1 cannot conclude 
without saying that I shall have nothing to do with it, if subsequent amendments be determined 
upon. Oppressions will be carried on as radically by the majority when adjustments and 
accommodations will be held up. I say, I conceive it my duty, if this government is adopted before 
it is amended, to go home. 1 shall
act as I think my duty requires. Every other gentleman will do the same. Previous amendments, in my 
opinion, are necessary to procure peace and tranquillity. I fear, if they be not agreed to, every 
movement and operation of government will cease; and how long that baneful thing, civil discord, 
will stay from this country, God only knows.

When men are free from restraint, how long will you suspend their fury? The interval between this 
and bloodshed is but a moment. The licentious and wicked of the community will seize with avidity 
every thing you hold. In this unhappy situation, what is to be done? It surpasses my stock of 
wisdom. If you will, in the language of freemen, stipulate that there are rights which no man under 
heaven can take from
you,                                                                                                
                                                                                         you shall 
have me going along with you; not otherwise.

[Here Mr. Henry informed the committee that he had a resolution prepared, to refer a declaration of 
rights, with certain amendments to the most exceptionable parts of the Constitution, to the other 
states in the confederacy, for their consideration, previous to its ratification. The clerk than 
read the resolution, the declaration of rights, and amendments, which were nearly the same as those 
ultimately proposed by the Convention ; which see
at the conclusion.]

Mr. HENRY then resumed the subject.

I have thus candidly submitted to you, Mr. Chairman, and this committee, what occurred to me as 
proper amendments to the Constitution, and a declaration of rights containing those fundamental, 
unalienable privileges, which I conceive to be essential to liberty and happiness. I believe that, 
on a review of these amendments, it will still be found that the arm of power will be sufficiently 
strong for national
purposes, when these restrictions shall be a part of the government. I believe no gentleman who 
opposes me in sentiments will be able to discover that any one feature of a strong government is 
altered; and at the same time your unalienable rights are secured by them.

The government unaltered may be terrible to America, but can never be loved till it be amended. You 
find all the resources of the continent may be drawn to a point. In danger, the President may 
concentre to a point every effort of the continent. If the government be constructed to satisfy the 
people, and remove their apprehensions, the wealth and the strength of the continent will go where 
public utility shall
direct. This government, with these restrictions, will be a strong government, united with the 
privileges of the people. In my Weak judgment, a government is strong when it applies to the most 
important end of all governmentsa€” the rights and privileges of the people. In the honorable 
member's proposal jury trial, the press and religion, and other essential rights, are not to be 
given up.

Other essential rights a€” what are they? The world will say that you intended to give them up. 
When you go into an enumeration of your rights, and stop that enumeration, the inevitable 
conclusion is, that what is omitted is intended to be surrendered.

Anxious as I am to be as little troublesome as possible, I cannot leave this part of the subject 
without adverting to one remark of the honorable gentleman. He says that, rather than bring the 
Union into danger, he will adopt it with its imperfections. A great deal is said about disunion, 
and consequent dangers. I have no claim to a greater share of fortitude than others, but I can see 
no kind of danger. I form my
judgment on a single fact alone a€” that we are at peace with all the world'; nor is there any 
apparent cause of a rupture with any nation in the world. Is it among the American states that the 
cause of disunion is to be feared? Are not the states using all their efforts for the promotion of 
union? New England sacrifices local prejudices for the purposes of union. We hear the necessity of 
the union, and predilection for
the union, reechoed from all parts of the continent; and all at once disunion is to follow!

If gentlemen dread disunion, the very thing they advocate will inevitably produce it. A previous 
ratification will raise insurmountable obstacles to union. New York is an insurmountable obstacle 
to it, and North Carolina also. They will never accede to it, till it be amended. A great part of 
Virginia is opposed most decidedly to it as it stands. This very spirit, which will govern us in 
these three states, will find a
kindred spirit in the adopting states. Give me leave to say that it is very problematical if the 
adopting states can stand on their own legs. I hear only on one side, but as far as my information 
goes, there are heartburnings and animosities among them. Will these animosities be cured by 
subsequent amendments?

Turn away from America, and consider European politics. The nations there which can trouble us are, 
France, Eng land, and Spain. But at present we know for a certainty that those nations are engaged 
in very different pursuits from American conquests. We are told by our intelligent ambassador, that 
there is no such danger as has been apprehended. Give me leave then to say, that dangers from 
beyond the
Atlantic are imaginary.

From these premises, then, it may be concluded that, from the creation of the world to this time, 
there never was a more fair and proper opportunity than we have at this day to establish such a 
government as will permanently establish the most transcendent political felicity. Since the 
revolution, there has not been so much experience. Since then, the general interests of America 
have not been better understood,
nor the Union more ardently loved, than at this present moment. I acknowledge the weakness of the 
old Confederation. Every man says that something must be done. Where is the moment more favorable 
than this? During the war, when ten thousand dangers surrounded us, America was magnanimous. What 
was the language of the little state of Maryland? "I will have time to consider. 1 will hold out 
three years.
Let what may come, I will have time to reflect." Magnanimity appeared every where. What was the 
upshot? America triumphed. Is there any thing to forbid us to offer these amendments to the other 
states? If this moment goes away unimproved, we shall never see its return.

We now act under a happy system, which says that a majority may alter the government when 
necessary. But by the paper proposed, a majority will forever endeavor in vain to alter it. 
Three-fourths may. Is not this the most promising time for securing the necessary alteration? Will 
you go into that government, where it is a principle that a contemptible minority may prevent an 
alteration? What will be the
language of the majority? Change the government. Nay, seven-eighths of the people of America may 
wish the change; but the minority may come with a Roman veto, and object to the alteration.

The language of a magnanimous country, and of freemen, is, Till you remove the defects, we will not 
accede. It would be in vain for me to show that there is no danger to prevent our obtaining those 
amendments, if you are not convinced already. If the other states will not agree to them, it is not 
an inducement to union. The language of this paper is not dictatorial, but merely a proposition for 
amendments. The
proposition of Virginia met with a favorable reception before. We proposed that convention which 
met at Annapolis. It was not called dictatorial. We proposed that at Philadelphia. Was Virginia 
thought dictatorial? But Virginia is now to lose her pre-eminence. Those rights of equality to 
which the meanest individual in the community is entitled, are to bring us down infinitely below 
the Delaware people.

Have we not a right to say. Hear our propositions! Why, sir, your slaves have a right to make their 
humble requests. Those who are in the meanest occupations of human life have a right to complain. 
What do we require? Not'preeminence, but safety a€” that our citizens may be able to sit down in 
peace and security under their own fig-trees. I am confident that sentiments like these will meet 
with unison in every
state; for they will wish to banish discord from the American soil. I am certain that the warmest 
friend of the Constitution wishes to have fewer enemies a€” fewer of those who pester and plague 
him with opposition. I could not withhold from my fellow-citizens any thing so reasonable. I fear 
you will have no union, unless you remove the cause of opposition. Will you sit down contented with 
the name of union,


In this state there are two hundred and thirty-six thousand blacks, and there are many in several 
other states. But there are few or none in the Northern States; and yet, if the Northern States 
shall be of opinion that our slaves are numberless, they may call forth every national resource. 
May Congress not say, that every black man must fight? Did we not see a little of this last war? We 
were not so hard pushed as to
make emancipation general; but acts of Assembly passed that every slave who would go to the army 
should be free.

Another thing will contribute to bring this event about. Slavery is detested. We feel its fatal 
effects a€” we deplore it with all the pity of humanity. Let all these considerations, at some 
future period, press with full force on the minds of Congress. Let that urbanity, which I trust 
will distinguish America, and the necessity of national defence,a€” let all these things operate on 
their minds; they will search that paper,
and see if they have power of manumission. And have they not, sir.? Have they not power to provide 
for the general defence and welfare? May they not think that these call for the abolition of 
slavery ? May they not pronounce all slaves free, and will they not be warranted by that power?

This is no ambiguous implication or logical deduction. The paper speaks to the point: they have the 
power in clear, unequivocal terms, and will clearly and certainly exercise it. As much as I deplore

on a review of these amendments, it will still be found that the arm of power will be sufficiently 
strong for national
purposes, when these restrictions shall be a part of the government. I believe no gentleman who 
opposes me in sentiments will be able to discover that any one feature of a strong government is 
altered; and at the same time your unalienable rights are secured by them.

The government unaltered may be terrible to America, but can never be loved till it be amended. You 
find all the resources of the continent may be drawn to a point. In danger, the President may 
concentre to a point every effort of the continent. If the government be constructed to satisfy the 
people, and remove their apprehensions, the wealth and the strength of the continent will go where 
public utility shall
direct. This government, with these restrictions, will be a strong government, united with the 
privileges of the people. In my Weak judgment, a government is strong when it applies to the most 
important end of all governmentsa€” the rights and privileges of the people. In the honorable 
member's proposal jury trial, the press and religion, and other essential rights, are not to be 
given up.

Other essential rights a€” what are they? The world will say that you intended to give them up. 
When you go into an enumeration of your rights, and stop that enumeration, the inevitable 
conclusion is, that what is omitted is intended to be surrendered.

Anxious as I am to be as little troublesome as possible, I cannot leave this part of the subject 
without adverting to one remark of the honorable gentleman. He says that, rather than bring the 
Union into danger, he will adopt it with its imperfections. A great deal is said about disunion, 
and consequent dangers. I have no claim to a greater share of fortitude than others, but I can see 
no kind of danger. I form my
judgment on a single fact alone a€” that we are at peace with all the world'; nor is there any 
apparent cause of a rupture with any nation in the world. Is it among the American states that the 
cause of disunion is to be feared? Are not the states using all their efforts for the promotion of 
union? New England sacrifices local prejudices for the purposes of union. We hear the necessity of 
the union, and predilection for
the union, reechoed from all parts of the continent; and all at once disunion is to follow!

If gentlemen dread disunion, the very thing they advocate will inevitably produce it. A previous 
ratification will raise insurmountable obstacles to union. New York is an insurmountable obstacle 
to it, and North Carolina also. They will never accede to it, till it be amended. A great part of 
Virginia is opposed most decidedly to it as it stands. This very spirit, which will govern us in 
these three states, will find a
kindred spirit in the adopting states. Give me leave to say that it is very problematical if the 
adopting states can stand on their own legs. I hear only on one side, but as far as my information 
goes, there are heartburnings and animosities among them. Will these animosities be cured by 
subsequent amendments?

Turn away from America, and consider European politics. The nations there which can trouble us are, 
France, Eng land, and Spain. But at present we know for a certainty that those nations are engaged 
in very different pursuits from American conquests. We are told by our intelligent ambassador, that 
there is no such danger as has been apprehended. Give me leave then to say, that dangers from 
beyond the
Atlantic are imaginary.

From these premises, then, it may be concluded that, from the creation of the world to this time, 
there never was a more fair and proper opportunity than we have at this day to establish such a 
government as will permanently establish the most transcendent political felicity. Since the 
revolution, there has not been so much experience. Since then, the general interests of America 
have not been better understood,
nor the Union more ardently loved, than at this present moment. I acknowledge the weakness of the 
old Confederation. Every man says that something must be done. Where is the moment more favorable 
than this? During the war, when ten thousand dangers surrounded us, America was magnanimous. What 
was the language of the little state of Maryland? "I will have time to consider. 1 will hold out 
three years.
Let what may come, I will have time to reflect." Magnanimity appeared every where. What was the 
upshot? America triumphed. Is there any thing to forbid us to offer these amendments to the other 
states? If this moment goes away unimproved, we shall never see its return.

We now act under a happy system, which says that a majority may alter the government when 
necessary. But by the paper proposed, a majority will forever endeavor in vain to alter it. 
Three-fourths may. Is not this the most promising time for securing the necessary alteration? Will 
you go into that government, where it is a principle that a contemptible minority may prevent an 
alteration? What will be the
language of the majority? Change the government. Nay, seven-eighths of the people of America may 
wish the change; but the minority may come with a Roman veto, and object to the alteration.

The language of a magnanimous country, and of freemen, is, Till you remove the defects, we will not 
accede. It would be in vain for me to show that there is no danger to prevent our obtaining those 
amendments, if you are not convinced already. If the other states will not agree to them, it is not 
an inducement to union. The language of this paper is not dictatorial, but merely a proposition for 
amendments. The
proposition of Virginia met with a favorable reception before. We proposed that convention which 
met at Annapolis. It was not called dictatorial. We proposed that at Philadelphia. Was Virginia 
thought dictatorial? But Virginia is now to lose her pre-eminence. Those rights of equality to 
which the meanest individual in the community is entitled, are to bring us down infinitely below 
the Delaware people.

Have we not a right to say. Hear our propositions! Why, sir, your slaves have a right to make their 
humble requests. Those who are in the meanest occupations of human life have a right to complain. 
What do we require? Not'preeminence, but safety a€” that our citizens may be able to sit down in 
peace and security under their own fig-trees. I am confident that sentiments like these will meet 
with unison in every
state; for they will wish to banish discord from the American soil. I am certain that the warmest 
friend of the Constitution wishes to have fewer enemies a€” fewer of those who pester and plague 
him with opposition. I could not withhold from my fellow-citizens any thing so reasonable. I fear 
you will have no union, unless you remove the cause of opposition. Will you sit down contented with 
the name of union,
without any solid foundation?

Mr. Henry then concluded, by expressing his hopes that his resolution would be adopted, and added, 
that, if the committee should disapprove of any of his amendments, others might be substituted.

Mr. HENRY then resumed the subject.

I have thus candidly submitted to you, Mr. Chairman, and this committee, what occurred to me as 
proper amendments to the Constitution, and a declaration of rights containing those fundamental, 
unalienable privileges, which I conceive to be essential to liberty and happiness. I believe that, 
on a review of these amendments, it will still be found that the arm of power will be sufficiently 
strong for national
purposes, when these restrictions shall be a part of the government. I believe no gentleman who 
opposes me in sentiments will be able to discover that any one feature of a strong government is 
altered; and at the same time your unalienable rights are secured by them.
