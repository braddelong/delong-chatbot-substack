American military power and technology span the globe and are girding themselves for a clash with China. </p><p>The US is a major energy producer and the supplier of last resort for liquefied natural gas. Which brings us to what is surely the most puzzling aspect of DeLong’s book: his failure to address the vast mobilisation of non-renewable resources that from its beginning defined and powered the American-led growth model. If the escape from Malthusian constraint defined what was radical about the 20th century, that century also brought us, from the 1970s onwards, a dawning certainty that environmental limits will indeed constrain our future.</p><p>Not by accident, modern environmentalism was born in the 1960s and 1970s above all in the US. In the 1990s, under Clinton and his vice-president Al Gore, the US was the pivot of world climate policy. But America’s political class abandoned that leadership role and the climate problem has since become the most unambiguous indicator by which to gauge the end of the era of US economic preponderance…. China emits more CO₂ than the entire OECD club of rich nations put together. In environmental terms, the American-led west no longer controls its own destiny. Of all of this there is no mention in DeLong’s history…</p></blockquote><p>1/ Yes. The U.S. remains a great power, even a superpower. But nobody outside it today mistakes it for the furnace in which the future is being forged, or for a global hegemon that believes itself to be and in some respects is attempting to guide the world toward at least a semi-utopian future of peace and prosperity. The U.S. retains immense strengths as a society, an economy, and a power. But nobody takes it as a model, and very few indeed trust it as a leader. The U.S. power-and-influence trajectory from 1970-2020 is very reminiscent of the British trajectory from 1885-1935.</p><div><hr></div><p>2/ The 1770-1870 Industrial Revolution century was in many respects the century of coal: the extraordinary bounty of the stored sunlight from more than 500 million years ago available for pennies because the last round of glaciers had served as bulldozers to scrape off all the post-Permian rock in much of northwest Europe, and the knock-on effects from the coal-fueled steamships that powered the ingathering of manufacturing to the districts of the world where it could be done most productively and efficiently. Those were perhaps two-thirds of net global technological advance over 1770-1870. Add in cotton, textile machinery, ironmongery, and steam engineering and you have the bulk of the rest.</p><p>The 1870-2020 Long 20th Modern Economic Growth century was, in some respects, a century of the transition from coal to oil. But it was, technologically, many other things as far as leading sectors were concerned as well—many other things in a way that the Industrial Revolution century of the coal, cotton, textile machinery, ironmongery, and steam engineering complex was not. </p><p>I only had 536 text pages. I decided to spend those of them I could spare for engineering technology on electricity and silicon, rather than have one paragraph each on forty different advances. Oil was one of the things that got left on the cutting room floor. So sue me—the consensus is that the book is too long, “sprawling” in the words of polite people, as it is.</p><div><hr></div><p>3/ I do write:</p><blockquote><p>Four developments… brought to an end… the long twentieth century, and… might mark the end of humanity’s time slouching toward utopia…. [1] 1990… industries of Germany and Japan… undermining… American exceptionalism…. [2] 2001… fanatic religious violence…. [e] Great Recession… 2008… forgotten… Keynesian lessons…. [4] failure… from roughly 1989… to combat global warming…</p></blockquote><p>One of the nice things about modern information technologies is that you can search, and are not forced to rely on your memory when you want to make a claim that there is “no mention” of something.</p>
