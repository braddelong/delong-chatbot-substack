<h2>Worthy Reads from Equitable Growth:</h2><p>1) 62 very good people funded for the net year. I confess that this program has been even more of a success than I had projected. It turns outa lot of very good people really were budget-constrained in doing the very good work that they wanted to do. And I confess that I had underestimated how much the research-university system as it worked a decade ago was constraining visible economic research away from policy-relevant and equitable growth-relevant topics:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Equitable Growth</strong>: <em>[A] Record $1.39 Million in Research Grants for Scholars Examining Economic Inequality &amp; Growth</em>: ‘The Washington Center for Equitable Growth today announced its 2021 research grants, with funding of $1,392,795—a record-breaking level—awarded to 62 researchers.

This was the case even after the demographic transition. While before the demographic transition in the time of astronomical child and maternal mortality the biosocial fertility load on women was enormous, even afterwards the inability to engage in reliable family planning was extraordinarily disruptive for women’s economic activity. Here Kate Bahn and Maryan Janani-Flores review the evidence:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Kate Bahn &amp; Maryam Janani-Flores</strong>: <em>Economic security &amp; Opportunity for Women Under Threat After U.S. Supreme Court Takes Anti-Abortion Stance in Texas</em>: ‘Nearly 1 in 4 women in the United States… will have an abortion by the age of 45, and nearly 1 in 20… will have an unintended pregnancy….

But why did they all but vanish from, say, the 1920s through the 2000s? My view is that first the “liquidationist” ideological turn of macroeconomics toward solving the problem of finding some reason that business cycles were functional for the system and then the neoclassical synthesis’s prioritization of rational representative-agent model made such “Hobsonian” theories profoundly uncool:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Atif Mian</strong>: <em>Understanding the Macroeconomic Consequences of Rising Income &amp; Wealth Inequality in the United States - Equitable Growth</em>: ‘With Ludwig Straub… and Amir Sufi… we show that when the rich save more… an increase in inequality leads to a persistent fall in the long-term interest rate and an growing reliance on credit for sustaining aggregate demand…. Downward pressure on aggregate demand… countered through increased borrowing by nonrich households. This kind of upswing in aggregate demand, however, is “indebted”…. It can only be sustained over time if&nbsp; interest rates fall…. The theory of indebted demand fits the empirical patterns observed in the United States…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/understanding-the-macroeconomic-consequences-of-rising-income-and-wealth-inequality-in-the-united-states/">https://equitablegrowth.org/understanding-the-macroeconomic-consequences-of-rising-income-and-wealth-inequality-in-the-united-states/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>4) Ever since the days of Alexander Hamilton, investors have regarded the debt of the U.S. government as a very valuable and safe asset. In all but rare and exceptional times, the only return return debt purchasers and holders have demanded from the U.S. government is that it maintain the real value of the wealth they have entrusted to it. The U.S. government should invest this wealth wisely and prudently, yes, in the highest societal-value projects, yes. But the main consideration and the bottom line is that—except in the 1870s and 1880s, and in the 1980s—the U.S. government has never faced a debt-financing constraint as long as long as its investments yield any possible positive return in the form of additional taxes collected downstream at all. Worried that this may change in the future if interest rates rise sharply? Then issue inflation-adjusted consols, and lock in real debt payments permanently:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Barry Eichengreen</strong>: <em>The Coming Public Debt Scare Should Not Spook U.S. Policymakers from Investing in Physical and Social Infrastructure</em>: ‘[In our] <em>In Defense of Public Debt</em>, my co-authors and I show how governments, through the ages, have resorted to issuing public debt to meet emergencies and address pressing social needs…. My co-authors and I argue [that] expenditure restraints that limit the U.S. economy’s capacity to grow would be counterproductive from even the narrow standpoint of debt sustainability…. Do our nation’s infrastructure problems rise to the level of a national emergency? Some answer yes, on the grounds that our physical infrastructure is old, dangerously vulnerable to climate change, and inadequately green and digital. A significant minority in the U.S. Senate insists otherwise…. One way of adjudicating the dispute is to ask whether additional infrastructure investments will pay for themselves…. We really should be comparing apples with apples—real returns with real returns. Currently… any investment that yields a positive real return is effectively self-financing…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/the-coming-public-debt-scare-should-not-spook-u-s-policymakers-from-investing-in-physical-and-social-infrastructure/">https://equitablegrowth.org/the-coming-public-debt-scare-should-not-spook-u-s-policymakers-from-investing-in-physical-and-social-infrastructure/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>Worthy Reads from Elsewhere:</h2><p>1) I confess I do not understand why a President Biden should shy away from a “potentially… contentious confirmation fight…” to get the most-qualified person who agrees with the administration’s view of what America’s interest is as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board. It’s not like a “contentious” Senate debate over the nomination of Lael Brainard to be Fed Chair would reduce the number of Republican senators who vote for Biden initiatives in the future, is it? And yet the Washington Blob thinks that avoiding “contention” is a thing that has immense value—but only when Democrats do it. Supporters of a Jay Powell renomination seem overwhelmingly concerned with dodging the question of “Is Jay Powell the best possible Fed Chair for the next four years?”: </p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Gregg Gelzinis</strong>: <em>’The best case (yet still realistic) scenario with a Powell reappointment</em> is that the ceiling on the progressive FinReg agenda is materially lowered. The worst case is that the entire progressive FinReg agenda is stymied &amp;Trump’s FinReg agenda persists at the Fed…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Jordan Weissmann</strong>: <em>’It’s pretty obvious he’s not ideal on FinReg</em>, either from the left’s or the admin’s perspective.

But is this the right way to frame the question? The answer to “should local governments commit the additional money to make the bus free?” is almost surely yes. The answer to “should local governments that have a fixed pool of money to spend on buses provide a lower-quality free bus than the current system?” is almost surely no. To fail to distinguish between these two questions leaves Matt, I think, somewhat confused. The real question is: which of the many worthwhile things that bus systems could do with more money can be framed so as to win voter support and enthusiasm?</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Matthew Yglesias</strong>: <em>Should the Bus Be Free?</em>: ‘In most cases, the better investment is to make the buses better…. In a very abstract way, free transit makes sense. Cars generate pollution and traffic externalities. Ideally, we would fully price those externalities with a carbon tax and congestion charges. But in the real world, both are politically difficult, so an equivalent way of addressing the issue would be to subsidize the low-externality option—the bus—by making it free…. [but] the question becomes: if you assume your transit agency has a bunch of extra money, is eliminating fares the best way to turn money into ridership? Bus riders want better buses, not cheaper…. Cutting fares is a relatively low priority compared to other things you can straightforwardly achieve with more money, like improving bus frequency and reducing bus crowding…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;https://www. slowboring.com/p/free-bus&gt;</p></blockquote></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>3) </p><p>4)</p><p>5)</p><p>6) </p><p>Cory Doctorow: End of the Line for Uber.

But I remember Jim Stock telling me in February 2020 that unless everyone greed afterthe fct that our Covi response had been overkill, we would not have done enough. The Biden administration did not hear this message. And so last March, I presume, they decided then that these measures would be overkill. Better late than never:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Heidi Przybyla</strong>: <em>’The Full Biden Plan Here:</em> 1. Requiring All Employers with 100+ Employees to Ensure their Workers are Vaccinated or Tested Weekly 2. Requiring Vaccinations for all Federal Workers and for Millions of Contractors. 3.

Calling on Large Entertainment Venues to Require Proof of Vaccination or Testing for Entry 5. Requiring Employers to Provide Paid Time Off to Get Vaccinated 6. Requiring Staff in Head Start Programs, DOD Schools, and Bureau of Indian Education-Operated Schools to be Vaccinated 7. Calling on All States to Adopt Vaccine Requirements for All School Employees 8.
