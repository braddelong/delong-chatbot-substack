Cory Doctorow once said to me: a€oeTherea€™ s this infamous and very funny old autoreply that Neal 
Stephenson used to send to people who emailed him. It basically went: a€~Ah, I get it. You feel 
like you were next to me when we were with Heiro Protagonist in Alaska fighting off the right-wing 
militias. But while you were there with me, I wasn't there with you.
And so I understand why you want to, like, sit around and talk about our old military campaigns. 
But I wasn't on that campaign with youa€!a€™ a€D Parasociality. In some ways, parasisociality has 
been gathering force ever since the first letter was sent. And parasociality does not have to be 
one-to-many: I wasna€™ t, after all, there when you read my letter. This
has become ramped up to a ludicrous degree in the age of the Internet. Indeed, most of my 
long-distance relationships, and many of my short-distance intellectual relationships, are 
parasocial^'yNQ are not talking; rather, I am talking to a sub-Turing instantiation of your mind 
that I have spun up from marks on a screen and am running on a separate partition in my
wetware, and you are talking to a sub-Turing instantiation of my mind that you have spun up from 
marks on a screen and are running on a separate partition in your wetware. We can more-or-less stay 
in sync as long as handshaking is frequent and message length is short. But if not, not:

Wikipedia: Parasocial Interaction: a€~An audience in their mediated encounters with performers in 
the mass mediaa€!. Viewers or listeners come to consider media personalities as friends, despite 
having no or limited interactions with them. PSI is described as an illusionary experience, such 
that media audiences interact with personas (e.g.,
talk show hosts, celebrities, fictional characters, social media influencers) as if they are 
engaged in a reciprocal relationship with them. The term was coined by Donald Horton and Richard 
Wohl in 1956a€!

Social network-stabilizing altruistic punishment gone horribly wrong!:

Alice E. Marwick: Morally Motivated Networked Harassment as Normative Reinforcement: a€~Networked 
harassment on social media functions as a mechanism to enforce social ordera€!. Moral outrage is 
used to justify networked harassment on social media. In morally motivated networked harassment, a 
member of a social network or
online community accuses a target of violating their networka€™ s norms, triggering moral outrage. 
Network members send harassing messages to the target, reinforcing their adherence to the norm and 
signaling network membership. Frequently, harassment results in the accused self-censoring and thus 
regulates speech on social media.
Neither platforms nor legal regulations protect against this form of harassment. This model 
explains why people participate in networked harassment and suggests possible interventions to 
decrease its prevalence^!

Successful attacka€”in the sense of creating afterwards a situation in which you can appoint local 
police who will do what you saya€”is becoming even harder; while blasting everything to bits is 
becoming easier:

Robert Farley: A Chinese Invasion of Taiwan: What Ukraine and War games Can Teach Us: a€~It is 
simply no longer possible to achieve strategic or even operational surprisea€!. Air superiority is 
difficult to achievea€!. Russian SEAD has been disappointing, and while the Chinese will probably 
derive greater attention to the suppression of
Taiwanese air defenses in their own campaign, they lack the decades of experience that the United 
States has developeda€!

Ah. This, I think, puts it very nicelya€”the set of fears that reach their culmination point in 
Karl Polanyi:

Jem Thomas: On Evans on Sperber on Marx: a€™ Richard J. Evansa€™ s comment on Jonathan Sperbera€™ s 
attempt to find a better translation of Marxa€™ s phrase a€~Alles stA^ndische und stehende 
verdampft,a€™ usually rendered a€~All that is solid melts into air,a€™ pinpoints a particular 
difficulty in translating the German term
Stand (LRB, 23 May). Sperbera€™ s preferred version a€“ a€~Everything that firmly exists and all 
the elements of the society of orders evaporatea€™ a€“ is, well, frankly hideous. On the other hand 
it is a lot more accurate than the elegant version it seeks to replace. The words Stand and its 
adjective stA^ndisch have been variously
translated  as a€~statusa€™, a€~estatea€™ , a€~estate-typea€™ and now here as a€~a society of 
ordersa€™ . None of these captures what Marx is talking about here, which is inequality organised 
on a basis other than class or market. For Marx the problem of the emancipation of the Jews was 
that it would a€~freea€™ them only to enter an
unequal, class-based world and, in so doing, would dissolve what was distinctive in a Jewish way of 
life, whatever value you might place on that.

Even more than Marx, Max Weber contrasted status-based (stA°ndisch) inequality with market-based 
divisions. A status group (Stand) has a distinctive way of life, which is regarded in a particular 
way, and is reflected in legal provisions and even in clothes or diet. An example in our 
contemporary world might be children: we think of them
as fully human yet somehow as a different order of beings from adults, with a different legal 
position and different preoccupations. To some degree, gender divisions too are stAondische 
differences.

For both Marx and Weber what mattered was that the sweeping away of the old order a€“ the ancien 
regime of, er, a€~social ordersa€™ a€“ is at first experienced as emancipation, only for the 
reality to dawn that what replaces it are different forms of exploitation and oppression and new 
social identities grounded solely in market position:
in buying or selling labour-power. The German term Stand is first cousin to the English word 
a€~standinga€™ , and both Marxa€™ s and Webera€™ s point was that modernity erodes all identities, 
honour and relationships in the acid of commercial exchange, leaving few of us really happy with 
where we standa€!

And not just Marx and Weber, Tocqueville too:

Hugh Brogan: On Evans on Sperber on Marx: a€™ As a student of Tocqueville who unfortunately knows 
no German, I am fascinated by the correspondence about Marxa€™ s phrase a€~Alles StA°ndischea€™ . 
Jem Thomasa€™ s letter suggests to me that a€~stA^ndisch, Standa€™ are exactly what Tocqueville was 
concerned with in
Democracy in America. In his opening sentence Tocqueville says that nothing caught his attention in 
the United States so much as a€~la€™ A©galitA© des conditionsa€™ . This phrase has given modern 
readers and translators a lot of trouble, as a€~conditionsa€™ nowadays are almost always taken to 
be physical a€“ material a€“
economic.                                                                                           
                                                             I have long preferred to use the word 
a€~statusa€™ to express Tocquevillea€™ s meaning, and it is clear from Thomasa€™ s letter that this 
is exactly what Marx had in mind. a€~Alles StA^ndische und Stehende verdampfta€™ would have given 
Tocqueville no trouble (he did know German); but he would of course have differed
from Marx in not wanting or expecting a proletarian order to ensue. What is most striking to me is 
that both sages laid so much stress on the same phenomenon a€“ the collapse of the ancien rA©gime. 
The irreversibility of this calamity may seem self-evident to us, but it was hardly so in 
Restoration Europe, the Europe of Metternich,
Nicholas II and Guizot, which shaped both men. By Thomasa€™ s account, Weber merely deepens and 
intensifies Tocquevillea€™ s anxious account of the new democratic regime. All that was solid had 
indeed melted into air, and we are still struggling with the consequences. I seem to glimpse a new 
framework of historical interpretation,
which will leave the stale orthodoxies of left and right on the scrapheap at lasta€!
