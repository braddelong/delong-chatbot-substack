<h2>FIRST: <strong>Tooze Reviews II: More Comments on His Take on My “Slouching Towards Utopia”</strong></h2><p>Well, we at least have gotten a “should read” blurb out of Adam Tooze, with respect to my <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em> &lt;<a href="http://bit.ly/3pP3Krk">bit.ly/3pP3Krk</a>&gt;:</p><blockquote><p>EZRA KLEIN: I think that is a good place to end. It’s always our final question. What are the three books that have been on your mind of late that you would recommend to the audience?</p><p>ADAM TOOZE: So I’ve been reading the Elena Ferrante, <em>Neapolitan Quartet</em> series, which are stunning. Another book that I read recently that rocked my world was Edward Paice’s book, <em>Youthquake: Why African Demography Should Matter to the World</em>. And though I read it and reviewed it quite critically, I think if you want to follow the conversation right now on global economic history, you should check out Brad DeLong’s <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em>, which came out recently and has been very widely reviewed, and make up your own mind.</p></blockquote><p>So that is something. </p><p>Nevertheless, I do feel I should correct a couple (more of the) misreadings from his FT review:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Adam Tooze</strong>: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a6b2198f-6c37-43aa-9638-063e4a6ca08c">Fueling America’s Global Dream</a>: ‘[WWI] war ended the first wave…. Humanity slouched towards utopia…. DeLong sees… Friedrich von Hayek and his followers… [as] right when they preached that the market would deliver dynamism and innovation, but… [as]… Karl Polanyi diagnosed, increasingly enfranchised populations… not passive victims… pushed back…. The result was a dysfunctional muddle, which John Maynard Keynes tried to sort out…. DeLong spans the familiar stations of north Atlantic political economy…. </p></blockquote><p>First, it is not just a single continous round of metaphorical warfare between “dynamism and innovation… [vs.] inequality and capitalist instability”. </p><p>Schumpeterian creative-destruction upsets whatever balance-of-exhaustion settlement or rather trench-line of political economy issues the previous generation had reached. It does this within the time frame of a single generation. And then it goes and does it again. Thus humans, repeatedly, need to rewrite the relations-of-production econo-social software running on top of the technology-driven forces-of-production hardware, for what worked a generation ago does not work now. </p><p>And then you have to do it again.</p><p>And the result is not a “muddle, which John Maynard Keynes tried to sort out”. The <em><strong>results</strong></em>, plural, were most of the history of the long twentieth century. </p><blockquote><p><strong>Adam Tooze</strong>: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a6b2198f-6c37-43aa-9638-063e4a6ca08c">Fueling America’s Global Dream</a>: ‘This is a surprisingly political economic history. Of course, individual policymakers, ideologies and institutions do matter…</p></blockquote><p>Second, as for it being a political economy book? </p><p>Yes. </p><p>Once I decided to choose the Polanyian Grand Narrative, the logic of that choice drove the book forward. </p><p>As for it being surprising that it is a political-economy von Hayek-vs.-Polanyi in the context of repeated generational Schumpeterian creative destruction?</p><p>That the book has <em><strong>a </strong></em>Grand Narrative is not surprising at all. That I chose one that focuses on embedding and managing the market in society is surprising only if you think of such issues of governance and system as unimportant, or think that they do not matter, or think that history is a matter of structural domination rather than human choice. </p><p>I do not think any of those are true: they are important, they matter, and human choices—often individual human choices that set prairies ablaze or snuff fires out—do matter.</p><p>Now I agree that my choice may well not have been the best choice. But I disagree with any claim that it is not <em><strong>a</strong></em> right choice.</p><p>Alternative choices would have been to focus on Michael Polanyi and company and the balance between mercenary and fiduciary institutions; on Peter Drucker and company and what John Kenneth Galbraith called the “managerial technostructure”; on Joseph Schumpeter and the centrality of entrepreneurship and investment in creative destruction; on Karl Popper and the idea of an open society. And there were others as well. </p><p>Which do you think would have been a better Grand Narrative to choose?</p><p>For me, perhaps the Grand Narrative I most regret not setting forth is the orthodox-Engelsian one.</p><p>Freddie from Barmen saw technology as the driver, with Feudal Societies giving way to Gunpowder-Empire Societies giving way to, in his day, Steampower Societies. After his day would come Socialist Utopia, with the end of the childhood of the human race. </p><p>But that is not what happened.</p><p>Instead, Steampower Societies were followed by, in succession:</p><ul><li><p>Second Industrial Revolution Societies</p></li><li><p>Mass Production Societies</p></li><li><p>Mass Consumption Societies</p></li><li><p>Global Value-Chain Societies. </p></li><li><p>And now we are well on our way to Bio-Infotech Societies. </p></li></ul><p>All of these are transformations of what one might call the “mode of production”, to coin a phrase, of similar magnitude to the shift from the hand-mill or the water-mill to the steam-mill. </p><p>Focusing on these shifts in the underlying mode-of-production, and then tracing the requirements that each successive such mode imposed on the societies built on top of it—that would have been a wonderful history to write. </p><p>But I went in another direction.</p><p>√√</p>
