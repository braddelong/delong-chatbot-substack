It is, I think, a sign of how hugely our income and wealth distribution is greatly warped away from the distribution that would support an economy that successfully addresses the vulnerabilities that we claim at least are of concern to us:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Irwin Garfinkel, Laurel Sariscsany, Elizabeth Ananat, Sophie M. Collyer, Robert Paul Hartley, Buyi Wang, &amp; Christopher Wimer</strong>: <em>The Benefits and Costs of a U.S. Child Allowance</em>: ‘We produce core estimates of the benefits and costs per child and per adult of increasing household income by $1,000 in one year; these can be applied to value any cash or near-cash program that increases household income. Using microsimulation, we then apply these estimates to determine net aggregate benefits of three child allowance policies….

Launching the war was not rational, yes. But continuing the war when it is clear that his generals were all lying to him about their forces’ capabilities is simply bonkers:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Zvi Mowshowitz</strong>: <em>More Data &amp; Peace Terms</em>: ‘Russia is increasingly framing this war internally as existential. Which is an odd thing to do while continuing to deny it is a war, forcing a kind of doublethink. It also has to be considered in light of Russian nuclear policy, which was affirmed as only to be used when the existence of the state is threatened. So then it becomes vital to represent that you see a threat to the existence of the state. Russia also claiming that Hunter Biden personally financed the Pentagon’s Ukrainian biological weapons labs.

That is because I do not think I know what "getting this right" would be. I do think they are thinking hard about the right issues. A university is a place to advance and test and evaluate thoughts and issues. A university is also a community to educate and help people grow—a safe space, to coin a phrase:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Michael Bérubé &amp; Jennifer Ruth</strong>: <em>When Professors’ Speech Is Disqualifying</em>: ‘Should academic freedom really protect those who make false and morally repellent claims? It’s time for a rethink…. Remarks are of course protected by the First Amendment. Whether they are also protected by academic freedom is the trickier question—and it is the one we want to ask…. So how does this principle guide us with professors espousing white supremacist ideas and defenses of colonialism and slavery when they claim to be speaking and writing on the basis of their scholarly expertise? When Gilley compares BLM “criminals” to the Red Guards of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, his First Amendment rights protect him. But that’s not the same thing as saying that his claims have the protection of academic freedom. He is not, after all, platforming as an ordinary citizen; he’s doing it, as he says in a tweet on June 16, 2020, “based on my knowledge of Mao’s politics.” This is critical. For here he is saying that his extramural commentary is manifestly an extension of what he considers his area of expertise—the history and politics of various regimes. He’s not staking his rights to this speech on the First Amendment, but on his claim to expertise as a scholar of political science…. Most discussions of “free speech on campus” don’t really concern academic freedom; rather, they tend to involve arguments that “cancel culture” and “wokeness” are making it impossible for Charles Murray to get a hearing for what are almost always disingenuously called “controversial ideas.” But some ideas don’t deserve a hearing, and one of the primary roles of the university is to distinguish between those that do—and should continue to be explored and built upon—and those that should not be seriously entertained by any legitimate institution of higher education. Conflating free speech with academic freedom obscures this basic truth…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/165649/professors-speech-disqualifying">https://newrepublic.com/article/165649/professors-speech-disqualifying</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Ken White, I think, gets us closer to the area in which, I think, “getting this right” is to be found:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ken White</strong>: <em>Our Fundamental Right to Shame And &amp; the New York Times</em>: ‘What happened to Professor Greg Patton was disproportionate and anti-Asian bigotry to boot. Shouting invited speakers down so they can’t speak and attendees can’t listen is fascist and contemptible. I could go on, but you get the point…. We [should] care about having a serious discussion about defining cancel culture… because simply complaining about it in the abstract… doesn’t ease the culture war. It inflames it…. I’m not saying that the New York Times Editorial Board intentionally supports those cynical elements of the Right. I’m saying the New York Times Editorial Board is being their useful idiots…. A discussion of norms that value proportionality and make people more comfortable speaking isn’t serious if it doesn’t take into account the interests of the people who want to speak in return. This is what I’ve called the “First Speaker Problem”—a focus on the freedom and feelings of whoever started talking to the exclusion of the freedom and feelings of whoever is responding…. It assumes, without evidence, that the First Speaker’s speech somehow promotes open discourse and isn’t itself “disproportionate”…. Let’s consider an example…. It’s irrational to ask whether responses to Yiannopoulos discourage speech without asking whether what he did discouraged speech…. What is the morally or philosophically coherent basis for focusing on Yiannopoulos’ feelings to the exclusion of the feelings of the person he singled out?… We’d be gullible if we didn’t ask whether the anti-cancel-culture norms being promoted by speakers like the <em>New York Times</em> are egalitarian or elitist…. Finally, the Times’ piece suffers from a common failing… failure to suggest what to do…. Saying “colleges shouldn’t disinvite speakers because of controversy” is a good specific action item; we can debate it…. We can’t grapple with “the culture makes me feel uncomfortable speaking.” Saying that just returns us to our cultural and partisan priors…. Get serious…. Be specific…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:50624599,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://popehat.substack.com/p/our-fundamental-right-to-shame-and&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:86716,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Popehat Report&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d6d0f415-4618-48a1-883f-f5c2087af66c_240x240.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Our Fundamental Right To Shame And Shun The New York Times&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;If you want to be a decent person, you should care about how you treat other people.

[But] even though the new classical theory implies that the forecast errors which are the aggregate demand impulses are serially uncorrelated, it is certainly logically possible that propagation mechanisms are at work that convert these impulses into serially correlated movements in real variables like output and employment… the presence of costs to firms of adjusting their stocks of capital and labor rapidly…. accumulation plans for claims on physical capital and other assets convert serially uncorrelated impulses into serially correlated demands for the accumulation of real assets… workers who for some reason are without jobs find it rational not necessarily to take the first job offer that comes along but instead to remain unemployed for awhile until a better offer materializes…. In principle the serially uncorrelated process of forecasting errors can account for any proportion between zero and one of the [serially correlated] steady state variance of real output or employment. The argument that such models must necessarily attribute most of the variance in real output and employment to variations in aggregate supply is simply wrong logically…</p></blockquote><p>My problem with the Lucas-Sargent argument is that even if the deviations from a long-run equilibrium path are serially correlated, shouldn’t those deviations be diminishing over time after the initial disturbance? Can these propagation mechanisms account for amplification of the initial disturbance before the adjustment toward the equilibrium path begins? I would gratefully welcome any responses…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://uneasymoney.com/2022/03/30/three-propagation-mechanisms-in-lucas-and-sargent/">https://uneasymoney.com/2022/03/30/three-propagation-mechanisms-in-lucas-and-sargent/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>In some ways this is of only history-of-thought interest. For Lucas and Prescott, at least, had within five years of the writing of “After Keynesian Macroeconomics” decided that the critics were right: that their models of how mistaken decisions driven by serially-uncorrelated forecast errors could not account for the bulk of the serially correlated business-cycle variance of real output and employment, and they needed to shift to studying real business cycle theory instead of price-misperceptions theory. The first problem was that time-series methods generated shocks that came at the wrong times to explain recessions. The second problem was that the propagation mechanisms did not amplify but rather damped the shock: at best they produced some kind of partial-adjustment process that extended the impact of a shock on real variables to N periods and diminished its impact in any single period to 1/N. There was no… what is the word?…. multiplier in the system.</p><p>It was stunning to watch in real time in the early 1980s. As Paul Volcker hit the economy on the head with the monetary-stringency brick, repeatedly, quarter after quarter; as his serially correlated and hence easily anticipated policy moves had large and highly serially correlated effects on output; Robert Lucas and company simply… pretended it was not happening: that monetary policy was <em><strong>not</strong></em> having major effects on output and employment in the first half of the 1980s, and that it was <em><strong>not</strong></em> the case thjat the monetary policies that were having such profound real impacts had no plausible interpretation as “surprises” leading to “misperceptions”. Meanwhile, over in the other corner, Robert Barro was claiming that he saw no break in the standard pattern of federal deficits from the Reagan administration’s combination of tax cuts plus defense buildup.</p><p>Those of us who were graduate students at the time watched this, and drew conclusions about the likelihood that Lucas, Prescott, and company had good enough judgment and close enough contact with reality that their proposed “real business cycle” research program would be a productive one—conclusions that, I think, time has proved fully correct.</p><p>Behind all this, of course, was this issue: the “microfoundations” of the Lucas “island economy” model were totally stupid: people are supposed to “misperceive” relative prices because they know the nominal prices at which they sell but do not know the nominal prices at which they buy, hence people confuse a monetary shock-generated rise in the nominal price level with an increase in the real price of what they produce, and hence work harder and longer and produce more? (I forget who it was who said at the time that the model seemed to require a family in which the husband worked and the wife went to the grocery store and the husband never listened to anything the wife said.) These so-called “microfoundations” could only be rationally understood as some kind of <em><strong>metaphor</strong></em>. But what kind of metaphor? And why should it have any special status, and claim on our attention?</p><p>Paul Krugman’s judgment on the consequences of this intellectual turn is even harsher than mine:</p><blockquote><p>What made the Dark Ages dark was the fact that so much knowledge had been lost, that so much known to the Greeks and Romans had been forgotten by the barbarian kingdoms that followed. And that’s what seems to have happened to macroeconomics in much of the economics profession. The knowledge that S=I doesn’t imply the Treasury view—the general understanding that macroeconomics is more than supply and demand plus the quantity equation — somehow got lost in much of the profession. I’m tempted to go on and say something about being overrun by barbarians in the grip of an obscurantist faith…</p></blockquote><p>I would merely say that it has left us, over what is now two generations, with a turn to DSGE models—Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium—that must satisfy a set of formal rhetorical requirements that really do not help us fit the data, and that it gave many, many people an excuse not to read and hence a license to remain ignorant of James Tobin.</p>
