>: a€oeCromwella€™s dictatorship [of the major-generals]
was necessary in order to establish the supremacy of the English bourgeoisie; the terrorism of the 
Paris Commune and of the Committee of Public Safety alone succeeded in
breaking the resistance of the feudal lords on French soil. Without the dictatorship of the 
proletariat which is concentrated in the big cities , the bourgeois reaction will not be done
away with.a€D Similarities with Friedrich A. von Hayeka€™ s concept of a a€oeLykourgan momenta€n in

Anti-individualism, rejection of capitalist market forces, and the wish to end internal class 
divisions combined with fervid nationalism, a program of
autarkic industrial development, and corporatist organizations were the hallmarks of the more 
dynamic fascist regimes in the 1930a€!. Manoilescu was
correct. The twentieth century is the century of corporatism. But he was wrong to think that the 
weak and fraudulent steps taken by fascism in the 1920s
and                                                                    1930s were significant. It 
is only now, outside the old capitalist centers, that societies which proudly proclaim themselves 
marxist are building genuine
corporatisma€!

Chirota€™ s thesis is that really-existing socialisma€”after the age of revolutionary mobilization 
and then of terror-driven industrialization is finisheda€’’converges on a form that
interwar fascists would have recognized as close to its ideal, a form that he calls 
a€cecorporatisma€D.

The consequences of Lenina€™ s failure to either move Stalin out of the leadership or set forward a 
succession plan can be glimpsed in the poetry of Anna Akhmatova, in the
introduction to her a€oeRequiema€n:

No, not under the vault of another sky, not under the shelter of other wings. I was with my people 
then, there where my people were doomed to be.

Instead of a Forward:

During the years of the Yezhovschina, I spent seventeen months standing outside the prison in 
Leningrad, waiting for news. One day someone recognized
me. Then a woman with lips blue from the cold, who was standing behind me, and of course had never 
heard of my name, came out of the numbness which
affected us all. She whispered in my ear (for we all spoke in whispers there): 'Can you describe 
this?a€™

"I said, 'I cana€™.

Then something resembling a smile slipped over what had once been her facea€!
