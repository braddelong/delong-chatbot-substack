First: Inflation Expectations: A Twitter Exchange, & a Project-Syndicate Piece:

With both the people surveyed by the University of Michigan and the bond market strongly betting 
that inflation will be back to its normal of 2% in the medium- and long-terma€”I do not see how a 
wage-price inflationary spiral can get established. Is it possible that workers and business owners 
are more fearful of and willing to act on the chance of medium-term inflation than general 
consumers or bond traders? Consumers perhaps. Bond traders Dash I simply do not see
that. Thus 1947 and 1951 still seem better historical analogies to me than 1974 or 1980. And 
1920a€”when the Fed raised interest rates from 3.75% to 7%, and Milton Friedman judged that it had 
overreacteda€’’seems definitely something to avoid:

Joe Weisenthal: a€™ Is there any evidence in either market-based measures or surveys of inflation 
expectations becoming unmoored?

COVIDa€‘T9 in early 2020, the current state of the US economy and labor market is nothing short of 
spectacular. And though an inevitable increase in inflation has rained on the parade, there is

[of the division of labor] happened much faster. Employment rose by 5% in the
space of just a year, because the Fed and US President Joe Bidena€™ s administration did not take

while that may prove to be correct, they have a weak case. The 1974 outbreak of inflation came
after a previous inflationary bout that had shifted expectationsa€!. In addition to a wage-price 
spiral, the other two commonly named culprits for non-transitory inflation are supply-chain 
bottlenecks and self-fulfilling expectations. Among these three, the only potentially serious risk

My favorite bread has long been Semifreddie Bakerya€™ s Odessa rye. Odessa was, as Paul Krugman 
says, the Chicago of Europe in the years before World War I. But instead of John Peter Altgeld, 
Clarence Darrow, Jane Addams, and Eugene V. Debs, Odessa had Lev Bronstein, alias Trotsky. All went 
smash when the Bolsheviki arrived. And then the Nazis showed up as well:

Paul Krugman: Odessa & the Ukraine That Should Have Been'. a€~Communism did many things badly, but 
one of the things it did worst was produce food. Joseph Stalina€™ s collectivization of agriculture 
led to the Ukraine famine of 1932a€“33a€!. In its final years, the Soviet Union wasna€™t starving, 
but it was dependent on large-scale imports of grain. After the Soviet collapse, however, this 
turned around. Starting around 20 years ago,
Ukraine, taking advantage of the fertility of its famous a€oeblack soila€D and the rise of 
globalization in general, began to export ever-larger quantities of graina€!. [Ukraine] initially 
became a huge wheat producer during that first era of globalizationa€!. What was the epicenter of 
this great agricultural complex? The city of Odessa, which in an economic sense became more or less 
the Chicago of the East, the place where railways gathered the
abundance  of a vast agricultural heartland and shipped it to the world. The city wasna€™ t even 
founded until 1794a€”by Catherine the Greata€sbut it mushroomed along with the regiona€™ s foreign 
trade, becoming the fourth-largest city in the Russian Empire, after St. Petersburg, Moscow and 
Warsawa€!. And the Odessa of 1913 seemed well on its way to becoming one of the worlda€™ s great 
cities, and not just economically. As a gateway to
the  world, it attracted an unusually diverse population. As part of the Pale of Settlementa€”the 
part of the Russian empire in which Jews were allowed to residea€”it was especially attractive to 
thousands of young people seeking escape from the confines of the shtetl; Jews made up roughly a 
third of its population. (My own maternal grandparents came from somewhere near Odessa.) This 
mixing of people seeking freedom as well as opportunity led
to a cultural efflorescence. Odessa was famed for its cafes, its literature, its music. Then 
history intervened. I dona€™ t think ita€™ s silly or anachronistic to say that the things that 
made Odessa special, that should have made it one of the worlda€™ s great metropolises, were 
precisely the things that ethnonationalists, then and now, hate: ethnic and religious diversity, 
intellectual curiosity, openness to the world. On the eve of the Russian invasion, it
looked as if Ukraine was finally managing to recover some of those thingsa€”which is, in turn, 
surely part of the reason Vladimir Putin decided it had to be conquered. And maybe remembering what 
Odessa might have become will help remind us how important it is that this attempt at conquest

An oldie but a very very goodie. Economists have relied and continue to rely on the declining 
marginal utility of consumption as their justification for the extra return on investment gained by 
bearing risk, and on observed willingness-to-pay for insurance. But you simply try to do the math, 
and you immediately conclude that you should be approximately risk-neutral for all but for most 
consequential of the gambles and decisions under uncertainty that you take during your
life.

Matt and Dick explicated this magnificently back in 2001.

But has that made any difference to economist practice, especially orthodox finance economistsa€™ 
practice? No. This is what my former roommate Robert Waldman says annoys him the most about 
economics: The standard model is tested. It is rejected. People applaud the paper that rejects it. 
And then the system resets. Tthe standard model continues as the baseline default assumption 
economists use:

Matthew Rabin & Richard H. Thaler (2001): Anomalies: Risk Aversion: a€™ Economists ubiquitously 
employ a simple and elegant explanation for risk aversion: It derives from the concavity of the 
utility-of-wealth function within the expected-utility framework. We show that this explanation is 
not plausible in most applications, since anything more than economically negligible risk aversion 
over moderate stakes requires a utility-of-wealth
function that is so concave that it predicts absurdly severe risk aversion over very large stakes. 
We present examples of how the expected-utility framework has misled economists, and why we believe 
a better explanation for risk aversion must incorporate loss aversion and mental accountinga€!

Are we serious about building geo olitical robustness into and trying to capture some of the 
positive externalities from the communities of engineering practice that surround high-end 
semiconductor manufacture? I very much hope that we are. But it will not be easy, will not be 
cheap, and will not be accomplished with simply a wave of some politiciansa€™ hands. Laura and 
John:

Laura Tyson & John Zysman: From Sanctions to Semiconductor Resilience & Security: a€~Construction 
of a new fabrication facility is estimated to require 3a€“5 years, at a cost of $10a€“20 
billiona€!. Building and operating competitive new fabrication capacity in the US and Europe will 
call for more than capital investment. It will also require regulatory support to facilitate 
environmental reviews and permittinga€! as well as complementary
investmentsa€!. Revitalizing US semiconductor production thus requires both physical and human 
capital. In the medium term, that means issuing more visas for highly skilled and experienced 
foreign workers; and, over time, it means increasing the number of Americans graduating from 
college with engineering degreesa€!. Russiaa€™ s war in Ukraine has highlighted an essential 
feature of the semiconductor industry. The technology and trade
sanctions  come at a moment when the US, Europe, and other key nodes in the semiconductor supply 
chain are planning large investments to address both economic and national security concerns. There 
is no better time to collaborate in developing a CRSS global supply of semiconductors^!

Another thing I owe to Robert Waldmann: the Kelly Criteriona€’’maximizing the expected growth rate 
of your wealtha€”is, for independent sequential gambles, utility-maximizing if and only if you 
possess logarithmic utility.

If your marginal utility of wealth declines less steeply than the log, then you should leverage 
yourself more than if you were maximizing your expected wealth growth rate. Then in the limit you 
will be almost certainly almost broke because the variance of the distribution of your log wealth 
will be high. But the extraordinary wealth of the potential future self of yours that strikes it 
lucky produces so much utility that it is in some sense "worth it". This is an unattractive
conclusion.

If your marginal utility of wealth declines more steeply than the log, then you should leverage 
yourself less than if you were maximizing your expected wealth growth rate. Then in the limit your 
wealth will almost surely be less than the wealth of somebody following the Kelly criterion. But it 
will be in some sense "worth it" because you will avoid the small chance of an extremely painful 
lower-tail outcome because your wealth distribution has low variance. This is also an
unattractive conclusion.

Peter Carr & Umberto Cherubini: Generalized Compounding & Growth-Optimal Portfolios: Reconciling 
Kelly and Samuelson by Peter Carr, Umberto Cherubini: a€~We generalize the Kelly criterion and the 
growth-optimal portfolio (GOP) concept beyond log-wealth maximization. We show that models of 
speculative price dynamics with time change require different compounding algebras leading to GOPs 
that do not coincide with log-wealth
maximization. In particular, in the Variance Gamma (VG) and the Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) 
models the GOP concepts mimick well-known utility models, namely power utility and the mean 
variance approach, with a parameter that, in both cases, is the variance of the stochastic clock. 
The standard log-wealth maximization model is obtained if the variance of the stochastic clock is 
set to zeroa€!

DRAFT: How to Think About What Used to Be Called a€oeWestern Civilizationa€n, & c.:

• Plus resource engrossment: imperialism & neoimperialism

•  2.5% of the world’s population in 800, 5% in 1500, 15% in 1870, 11% of the world’s population 
today

2021*02-16

Consider a 300-mile radius circle around the port of Dover at the southeastern corner of Great 
Britain. Before 1500 that Dover Circle was no place special. In 1500 it looks to a civilization 
normal measured by the yardsticks provided by the other high civilizations of Asia. There is little 
special in terms of technology, cultural sophistication, political organization, wealth, or 
population density. It does have an edge in making machinery like clocks, and gunpowder weapons,
and printing via metal movable type. But that is it.

After 1500 states at the western edge of Eurasia, first Portugal and Castile in Iberia, and then 
those of the Dover Circle, and then those that directly through settlement or indirectly through 
emulation derive from the Dover Circlea€”well, over the next 450 years they conquer the world. Even 
today the Dover-Circle-Plus societies engross a much larger share of the worlda€™ s resources than 
the l/20th or so of the worlda€™ s resources in the Dover Circle, and thus controlled
by the Dover-Circle societies in 1500. They have gained those resources via conquest, settlement, 
theft, and purchase. The populations and the world population share in the Dover-Circle-Plus 
societies have expanded enormously, through natural increase inside the Dover Circle itself through 
natural increase and immigration; outside through conquest, settlement, further expansion; and 
outside through emulation, as people elsewhere decide that the Dover-Circle civilizations
are ones that they need to emulate, or else something not-good is likely to happen to them.

Simon Kuznets in his Nobel Prize lecture back in 1971 pointed to:

Factorsa€! [that] have limited the spread of modern economic growtha€!. Japan is the only nation 
outside of those rooted in European civilization that has joined the group of developed 
countriesa€!. The increasingly national cast of organization in developed countries made for 
policiesa€! clearly inhibiting [convergence] a€! colonial statusa€! imperialist exploitationa€! 
[neutralizing] the remarkable institutions by which the Sinic and East Indian
civilizations produced the unified, huge societies that dwarfed in size any that originated in 
Europe until recentlya€i.

Back when my father was at Harvard College in the late 1950s, he was privileged to take what was by 
all accounts one of the greatest college courses ever taught: Sam Beera€™ ss a€oeWestern Thought 
and Institutionsa€D. a€oeWesterna€n meaning that he placed their origin and development at the 
western edge of the Eurasian supercontinent, in the Dover Circle. a€ceInstitutionsa€D being ways of 
organizing human beings. a€ceThoughta€D being the set of ideas and
concepts that underlay the patterns of institutional development found in what I am calling the 
a€oeDover Circlea€™

The premise of the course was that these a€oeWestern Thought and Institutionsa€n were things of 
uniquely remarkable power and value for humanity. The conceit was that this pattern of intellectual 
and institutionala€”and psychological, sociological, political, military, and 
economica€”developmenta€”was the result of the coming together of five interacting strands:

1. Jerusalem: the enduring value of each individual ass an equal, and the sovereignty of the 
individual^™ s conscience.

2. Athens: debate, discussion, knowledge, inquiry, and democracy as what humanity was made to do.

3. Sparta: the disciplined submission of the individual to the organization of the collectivity, in 
order to achieve our common purposes: for the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one.

4. Rome: the continent-spanning Imperial Peace and its civilization of prosperity, production and 
trade based on one law for everyone, with membership restricted not to some real or 
fictitious-imagined kin group, but rather open to all who would pledge to the purposes of 
civilization.

Consider a 300-mile radius circle around the port of Dover at the southeastern corner of Great 
Britain. Before 1500 that Dover Circle was no place special. In 1500 it looks to a civilization 
normal measured by the yardsticks provided by the other high civilizations of Asia. There is little 
special in terms of technology, cultural sophistication, political organization, wealth, or 
population density. It does have an edge in making machinery like clocks, and gunpowder weapons,
and printing via metal movable type. But that is it.

After 1500 states at the western edge of Eurasia, first Portugal and Castile in Iberia, and then 
those of the Dover Circle, and then those that directly through settlement or indirectly through 
emulation derive from the Dover Circlea€”well, over the next 450 years they conquer the world. Even 
today the Dover-Circle-Plus societies engross a much larger share of the worlda€™ s resources than 
the l/20th or so of the worlda€™ s resources in the Dover Circle, and thus controlled
by the Dover-Circle societies in 1500. They have gained those resources via conquest, settlement, 
theft, and purchase. The populations and the world population share in the Dover-Circle-Plus 
societies have expanded enormously, through natural increase inside the Dover Circle itself through 
natural increase and immigration; outside through conquest, settlement, further expansion; and 
outside through emulation, as people elsewhere decide that the Dover-Circle civilizations
are ones that they need to emulate, or else something not-good is likely to happen to them.

Simon Kuznets in his Nobel Prize lecture back in 1971 pointed to:

Factorsa€! [that] have limited the spread of modern economic growtha€!. Japan is the only nation 
outside of those rooted in European civilization that has joined the group of developed 
countriesa€!. The increasingly national cast of organization in developed countries made for 
policiesa€! clearly inhibiting [convergence] a€! colonial statusa€! imperialist exploitationa€! 
[neutralizing] the remarkable institutions by which the Sinic and East Indian
civilizations produced the unified, huge societies that dwarfed in size any that originated in 
Europe until recentlya€!.

Back when my father was at Harvard College in the late 1950s, he was privileged to take what was by 
all accounts one of the greatest college courses ever taught: Sam Beera€™ ss a€oeWestern Thought 
and Institutionsa€D. a€oeWesterna€n meaning that he placed their origin and development at the 
western edge of the Eurasian supercontinent, in the Dover Circle. a€ceInstitutionsa€D being ways of 
organizing human beings. a€ceThoughta€D being the set of ideas and
concepts that underlay the patterns of institutional development found in what I am calling the 
a€oeDover Circlea€™

The premise of the course was that these a€oeWestern Thought and Institutionsa€n were things of 
uniquely remarkable power and value for humanity. The conceit was that this pattern of intellectual 
and institutionala€”and psychological, sociological, political, military, and 
economica€”developmenta€”was the result of the coming together of five interacting strands:

1. Jerusalem: the enduring value of each individual ass an equal, and the sovereignty of the 
individual^™ s conscience.

2. Athens: debate, discussion, knowledge, inquiry, and democracy as what humanity was made to do.

3. Sparta: the disciplined submission of the individual to the organization of the collectivity, in 
order to achieve our common purposes: for the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one.

4. Rome: the continent-spanning Imperial Peace and its civilization of prosperity, production and 
trade based on one law for everyone, with membership restricted not to some real or 
fictitious-imagined kin group, but rather open to all who would pledge to the purposes of 
civilization.

5. The Schwarzwald: from the forests of western Germany, the idea of society and its organization 
as a contract among freemen, with pledges of trust of man to man, of man to group, and of group to 
man, with leaders and purposes not decreed by a god but chosen by men so that they can protect 
their lives and their liberties, and pursue their various happinesses.

unborn .f

This underpinning story is a Grand Narrative. That means that it is useful to think with. Indeed, 
it is essential to think with such Grand Narratives: we cannot do otherwise. We are 
narrative-loving animals, and without thinking in narratives we cannot think with any 
sophistication at all. And yet that that story is a Grand Narrative has another implication: It is 
that it is very dangerous to believe that it, or any such Grand Narrative, is true.

For the story of the torch of western civilization being passed down in a relay race from 
progenitor-ancestors to their legitimate successor-inheritors is false. That is simply not the way 
it happened. To think that it did happen that way is simply bonkers. Roman statesman Marcus Tullius 
Cicero thought very little of any claim that any inhabitants of Britain would be his legitimate 
heirs: he saw them as too dumb, uncivilized, and uneducated to even be worth enslaving. Ideas of
respect for individuals, of the value of discussion and inquiry, of institutions crafted not to 
serve the gods but the peoplea€”such institutions, patterns, and cultural traditions have had many 
separate origins, for many people in many places over history have tried many times for such. It is 
simply not the case that these would be absent from human civilization had Jerusalem, Athens, 
Sparta, Rome, and the Schwarzwald never existed.

Attempts to understand the absolute and relative wealth and power of the Dover-Circle-Plusa€”of the 
Dover-Circle societies and their emulatorsa€”in the late 1800s, the 1900s, and continuing often run 
aground. It is an important part of our history. But, as my old teacher the late David Landes used 
to say: practically every attempt at understanding soon degenerates into either a€oethe west is so 
good and the rest are so bada€D or a€oethe west is so bad and the rest are so
good.a€D Neither of these is either especially true or particularly helpful.

Indeed, the a€oeWestern Thought and Institutionsa€oe way of approaching human history is only one 
that could be thought up by somebody from the island of Great Britain, or from northern France, or 
from the Low Countries, or from western Germany. It would never occur to anyone from anywhere else 
to think of things in this way.
So we should strive to move beyond the presuppositions of Sam Beera€™ s version of history. I know 
he would want us to. But how do we do so?
