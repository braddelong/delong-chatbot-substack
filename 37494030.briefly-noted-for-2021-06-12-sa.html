But the risk that the recovery will be anemic is real as well. If inflation risks turn out to materialize, the Federal Reserve has a straightforward way of handling them. If anemic-recovery risks materialize, there is no path to easily handle them. Given the immense uncertainties, an ability to do the math of option value under asymmetric risks mandates that the sensible thing to do is to prioritize rapid recovery now, and to wait until early 2023 to see where we are with respect to inflation.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F925650ef-52a4-4edf-8da4-0417add7c14c_1756x1426.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F925650ef-52a4-4edf-8da4-0417add7c14c_1756x1426.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F925650ef-52a4-4edf-8da4-0417add7c14c_1756x1426.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F925650ef-52a4-4edf-8da4-0417add7c14c_1756x1426.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F925650ef-52a4-4edf-8da4-0417add7c14c_1756x1426.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/925650ef-52a4-4edf-8da4-0417add7c14c_1756x1426.png" width="1456" height="1182" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/925650ef-52a4-4edf-8da4-0417add7c14c_1756x1426.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1182,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:136660,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F925650ef-52a4-4edf-8da4-0417add7c14c_1756x1426.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F925650ef-52a4-4edf-8da4-0417add7c14c_1756x1426.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F925650ef-52a4-4edf-8da4-0417add7c14c_1756x1426.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F925650ef-52a4-4edf-8da4-0417add7c14c_1756x1426.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>And, no, we are not “reluctant to criticize the Biden stimulus plans because we share his concerns about [America’s] social and political problems”. We are reluctant to criticize the Biden stimulus plans because they seem sensible ways to (i) provide relief, and (ii) guard against the risk of an anemic recovery like the one that Mervyn King and his peers presided over from 2010–2013. I would be very interested in what Mervyn King would have to say about how to avoid policy mistakes in the future like the ones he played his part in making over 2010–2013. I am much less interested in reading him making false claims about why I and people like me think that insuring against another anemic recovery is job #1 right now, with control over inflation expectations best reserved to be the concern of central banks at some future date:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Mervyn King</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Make No Mistake, the Risk of Inflation Is Real</em>: ‘Price stability is when people stop talking about inflation and their decisions reflect genuine economic factors. It has been a long time since inflation was a talking point but, especially in the United States, it has reentered public debate…. Rising input prices and higher output prices reflecting shortages…. Some of these increases may well prove transitory. For the first time since the 1980s, though, two factors make inflation a serious risk: excessive monetary and fiscal stimulus, and weak political resistance…. Many economists are reluctant to criticize the Biden stimulus plans because they share his concerns about the country’s social and political problems. But I’ve seen few challenges to the proposition that the degree of stimulus is out of all proportion to the magnitude of any plausible output gap. And the same logic applies to other advanced economies…. Central-bank independence will be tested over the next few years…. A combination of political pressure to assist in financing budget deficits, promises not to tighten policy too soon, and a growing involvement by central banks in political matters all point to a growing risk that central banks will respond too slowly to higher inflation. </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-07/make-no-mistake-the-risk-of-inflation-is-real-mervyn-king">https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-07/make-no-mistake-the-risk-of-inflation-is-real-mervyn-king</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-06-12-sa?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-06-12-sa?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>John Hennessy and David Patterson</strong>: <em>A New Golden Age of Computer Architecture</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LVeEjsn8Ts">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LVeEjsn8Ts</a>&gt;</p><div id="youtube2-3LVeEjsn8Ts" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;3LVeEjsn8Ts&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3LVeEjsn8Ts?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Marion Fourcade, Etienne Ollion, &amp; Yann Algan</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Superiority of Economists</em>&lt;<a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.1.89">https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.1.89</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jeremy Arnold</strong>:&nbsp;<em>First-Principles Journalism: A Blueprinte</em>: ‘What journalism could like look if we rebuilt it from scratch for our times… &lt;<a href="https://savingjournalism.substack.com/p/first-principles-journalism-a-blueprint">https://savingjournalism.substack.com/p/first-principles-journalism-a-blueprint</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Glen Peters</strong>:&nbsp;<em>’How does the global average temperature increase</em>&nbsp;compare to atmospheric CO₂ concentrations in the last ~100 years?

Washing clothes required a full day’s labor, as women fetched water from a tap in the courtyard or the street, boiled and scrubbed the clothes, exchanged dirty for clean water, and then rinsed and wrung out their laundry…. It was no surprise, then, that French women’s magazines routinely depicted the pleasures of life in the United States, where domestic appliances appeared to have made housework obsolete…. The image of a home filled with “mechanical servants” was attractive to French women.&nbsp;But having just emerged from years of depression and war and now facing a continuing housing shortage and inflation, most French citizens found the prices of home appliances beyond their reach. Two postwar changes helped to remedy this situation. First, the spread of new spending methods—notably credit—lowered the price of appliances and made them available to more families.&nbsp; Second, French families came to accept that these items, which had been rare before the war, were now indispensable….
