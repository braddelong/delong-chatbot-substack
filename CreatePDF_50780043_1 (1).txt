The Fed Has Done an Amazing Job!


•  Assisted by fiscal authorities, of
course

•  Employment fell by 14%
because of the plague & knock-
on aggregate-demand effects

•  Half of that we got back more-
or-less immediately

•  But then we had to reknit the
division of labor

•  Something that took four years
in the 2010s took 15 months in
the 2020s

One Reason I Do Not Think the Fed Is (Far) Behind the Curve


Financial Conditions

•  They tell us that at least the
manufacturing component of the
economy    is slowing

•  And that is with what the Fed has
already done.

•  Le., one rate rise, and some
jawboning about what it is
expected to do.

•  Would one want more slowing
than the FC index tells us is
already baking in the cake?

•  If you think so, why?

Olivier Blanchard is very
worried

•  He is very, very sharp indeed...

•  But I do not see why he finds the
analogy to 1975 convincing...

•  1975 came after a 15-year runup
of inflation, interrupted by a half­
hearted Nixon-administration
attempt  to control it

•  (Half-hearted because Nixon did
not want higher unemployment
ever; and Arthur Burns believed
that Congress would not stand for
disinflation)

•  We have a generation of stability

What Do We Make of the Current Employment Shortfall?

Larry Summers is very worried

•  Domash & Summers: How Tight Are U.S.

•  I think we are going to get vaccinations,

retirements back in the labor force

•  That leaves us with population aging and


immigration restrictions—2.7 million people

What Is the Current Macroeconomic Outlook Here in the U.S.?

What is the current macroeconomic outlook here in the United States?

First of all, the Federal Reserve ought to be taking a good many victory laps. The coming of the 
plague bounced employment down by 14%, as pieces of the economy shut down to try to slow the spread 
and as only partially counterbalance the loss of income from those shut downs caused slack demand 
elsewhere in the economy. Then, with reopening, employment bounced up by 7%, leaving it about 7% 
below its pre-plague level.

Getting that 7% of employment back was going to be more difficult because the societal division of 
labor needed to be re-knitted in a new pattern. During the disappointing, anemic, unsatisfactory 
recovery from the great recession a decade ago, that re-knitting took place at a pace of only about 
1.3 percentage points per year. With slack, inadequate, and only slowly growing demand, it was very 
difficult to figure out what business models would be profitable and
where labor was really needed. But this time the economy has re-knit the division of labor to the 
amount of 5% of employment in a year because the Federal Reserve and the Biden administration did 
not, as their counterparts did in the early 2010s, take their feet off the gas pedal much too 
early.

This is a huge economic victory, perhaps the greatest in the United States I have seen. Jay Powell 
and Company should be rightly very proud.

But, as a side effect and a consequence, we have inflation. Our current inflation was inevitable, 
and is not regrettable: when you rapidly re-join the traffic at speed, you leave some of the rubber 
from your tires on the road. But what happens next?
The bond market thinks that this wave of inflation will pass and things will return to normal not 
in the short but in the medium term. The bond market right now judges that between five and 10 
years from now inflation will average 2.2% per year.
Is it right? Probably, but there is a chance that it is not.

I believe that the bond marketa€™ s judgments are relatively trustworthy here. They are, however, 
to be trusted not because the bond market is a good forecaster. The bond market is not. But if our 
current inflation does not die away quickly, it will be because people do not expect it to die away 
quickly. And, as Joe Gagnon of the PIIE points out, the people whose expectations matter for this 
substantially overlap with the people placing bets on the bond market.
In addition, Goldman Sachs reports that its US Financial Conditions index is softening rapidly, and 
the FCI has been a good guide in the past to the strength of the business cycle. Thus there seems 
to be less worry about "overheating" of the economy in the next year and a half than one might have 
feared.

Stepping back, there were six episodes of US inflation above 5% in the 1900s. One, the World War II 
inflation, was cut off by price controls. One, the World War I inflation, was cut off and turned 
into substantial deflation and a deep but short recession by what Milton Friedman judged had been 
an excessive increase by the Federal Reserve and interest rates from 3.75 to 7%. Two, the post 
World War II and the Korean War inflations, were transitory and passed
quickly without substantial monetary tightening. And two made up the 1970s inflation, ultimately 
scotched only by the deep recession of the Volcker disinflation.

Everybody making arguments about the likely course of inflation right now is, whether they 
recognize it or not, basing their arguments not on theoretical principles but on a judgment of 
which historical episode is the best analogy. Those who, like my extremely sharp teacher Olivier 
Blanchard, see the 1970s as the best analogy may be correct, but they have a very weak case: the 
1974 outbreak of inflation came after a previous inflation wave that had shifted
expectations. By 1973 people expected that inflation would, in the absence of ongoing recession, be 
about what inflation had been last yeara€”and, if anything, a little more. I see exactly zero 
evidence for this loss of the anchoring of inflation expectations.

Employment is still some 7.3 million below its pre-plague trend. My extremely sharp teacher Larry 
Summers and Alex Domash see 2.7 million of those as due to structural factorsa€’’population aging 
and immigration restrictionsa€”that cannot be reversed. But that still leaves 4.6 million that are 
now out of the labor force but could be possibly tempted back in by a sufficiently strong economy 
of high opportunity. That potential pool makes me fear an
inflationary wage spiral less.

An inflationary spiral as employers try to hire more workers than can ever be available, 
supply-chain bottlenecks, and self-fulfilling expectationsa€”of the three possible sources of a 
non-transitory inflation, only an inability to resolve supply-chain bottlenecks seems to me at 
least to be a potentially serious risk. And here comes the bad news: Russian dictator Vladimir 
Putina€™ s attack on the Ukraine has, as happened in the early 1970s, sent prices of oil and
grain spiraling upward. There is some chance the 1970s will turn out to be the right analogy after 
all.
