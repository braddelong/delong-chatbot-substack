Michael walks us through the factors that are used to calculate the cost of insurance for most people – credit, education, zip code, and job titles, just to name a few. As expected, the racial disparities inherent in those factors naturally spill out into the pricing of insurance and handling of insurance claims. We discuss some real world examples of insurance discrimination and the impact it has on Black families trying to protect their most valuable assets. And then we conclude with Michael providing the Brokers some practical tips on how to spot whether they’re experiencing discrimination and what steps can be taken if that’s true. Tune in and get the scoop!…</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank"

href="https://ianleslie.substack.com/p/moral-hygiene">Moral Hygiene</a>: <em>A philosopher's apology and why it failed</em>: ‘After repudiating his earlier assertion… he then spent more space discussing those issues than he had spent apologising. This has been, understandable, badly received.... He [then] added <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/">this</a>… to the front page of his website…. “sometimes I have the impression that the world is a conspiracy to distract us from what’s important—alternatively by whispering to us about tempting opportunities, at other times by buzzing menacingly around our ears like a swarm of bloodthirsty mosquitos”. The “swarm of bloodthirsty mosquitos”&nbsp; has been taken to refer to the people who have been upset by his apology. Hardly a phrase calculated to improve the situation. Bostrom has made a classic politician’s error: his apology wasn’t really an apology and he then blamed his critics for focussing on the issue…</p></blockquote><p>People who feel put upon and don’t understand why others are asking for an apology keep digging. People who want to apologize say not “that did not represent my views” but rather: “I am profoundly embarrassed that I was the person who wrote that. I very much hope I am not that person now. I apologize unreservedly.” FULL STOP.</p><p>Not to mention, there are all the intelligence issues around, not being a moron and not being a dick. A very basic part of the basic human-intelligence portfolio is to understand at a very early age that language is, substantially, simply a bag of the words that you use. Relying on the fine parsing of sentence structure and taking refuge in the “use-mention” distinction never saves you from being thought of as—from being—a moron, and an asshole, nor should it.</p><p>In Nick Bostrom’s case—and in many others—there seems to be a definite inverse correlation between the types of mental behaviors they value on the one hand, and what normal people think of as “not being really stupid” on the other.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Doug North: </strong><a href="https://pubs-aeaweb-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.5.1.97">Institutions</a>…</p></li><li><p><strong>John Gruber: </strong><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/the_billions-dollar_vr_ar_headset_question">The Billions-Dollar VR/AR Headset Question</a>: ‘It’s like <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/remembering-the-dynabook/">Alan Kay’s 1972 Dynabook</a>… which clearly articulated the laptops and tablets that now dominate personal computing, and but we’re as far from practical AR glasses today as we were from Kay’s Dynabook in the early ’80s…</p></li><li><p><strong>Augusta Saraiva: </strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-27/us-pce-inflation-cools-further-paving-way-for-smaller-fed-hike?srnd=premium">Key Inflation Gauge Cools Further, Paving Way for Smaller Fed Rate Hike</a>…</p></li><li><p><strong>Damon Linker: </strong><a href="https://damonlinker.substack.com/p/the-two-americas-on-religion">The Two Americas (on Religion)</a>…</p></li><li><p><strong>Kristine Aquino: </strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-01-27/five-things-you-need-to-know-to-start-your-day?cmpid=BBD012723_MKT">Intel Woes</a>: ‘Intel shares fell as much as 11% in premarket trading after it gave one of the gloomiest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-26/intel-tumbles-after-forecast-suggests-its-comeback-is-far-off">quarterly forecasts</a>&nbsp;in its history… a painful admission for a firm that has been attempting a multiyear comeback…&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Peter Valdenez-Depena: </strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/25/business/consumer-reports-ford-bluecruise-tesla/index.html">Consumer Reports calls Ford's automated driving tech much better than Tesla's</a>…</p></li><li><p><strong>Cory Doctorow: </strong><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/">‘Here is how platforms die:</a> first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves.
