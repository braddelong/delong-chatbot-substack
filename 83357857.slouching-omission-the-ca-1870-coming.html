Then we got the institutions for organization and research and the technologies—we got full globalization, the industrial research laboratory, and the modern corporation. These were the keys. These unlocked the gate that had previously kept humanity in dire poverty. The problem of making humanity rich could now be posed to the market economy, because it now had a solution. On the other side of the gate, the trail to utopia came into view. And everything else good should have followed from that…</p></blockquote><p>Nick S. of <em>Unfogged</em> &lt;<a href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2022_11_06.html#018157">http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2022_11_06.html#018157</a>&gt; points out:</p><blockquote><p>Given the list of three key changes in the organization of human and economic life (‘globalization, the industrial research lab, and the modern corporation’) there's minimal attention paid to the ways in which those shaped the power of government as well as the economy. Globalization is certainly political as well as technological and possibility of deglobalization is driven by political factors. The industrial research lab and corporation grew in tandem with increased state capacity. It struck me, as I was writing this summary, that the figure cited above -- that the British government was able to mobilize 1/3 the productive capacity of the country for the war effort -- is specific to the long 20th Century (quick googling makes me think the Civil War involved similar levels of mobilization but, I believe, prior to that state capacity was much more limited).</p></blockquote><p>He is correct. The coming of the modern state with its organizational and regulatory capacity is a fourth major change around 1870, that I should not have omitted.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/slouching-omission-the-ca-1870-coming/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/slouching-omission-the-ca-1870-coming/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p></p>
