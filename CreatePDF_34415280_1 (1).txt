• Chicago-style economics courses do 10 weeks on market success, one week on market failure, one 
week on how a market failure actually isna€™ t because Coase Theorem, and one week on how it is 
never
possible for any regulation of any sort of any market to improve things.

• Our courses do three weeks on market success, and 10 weeks on market failuresa€”and how to fix 
them.

Harold Meyerson: The Berkeley School: a€~a€oelntroductory economics courses are about 12 or 13 
weeks long,a€D says Berkeley economics professor Brad DeLong, who worked in the Treasury Department 
during the
Clinton administration. a€oeAt Chicago and similar institutions, they teach 11 weeks on how great 
markets are and one week on market failures. We teach three weeks on market successes and ten weeks 
on market failures.
They neglect the problem of income distribution and have fuzzy thinking about the asymmetry of 
information that impedes the knowledge that people need for markets to work.a€Da€!

Charlie Sykes: d€oeRet ConningdCmTrumpism: a€~Lest we forget, here is Deborah Birxa€™ s attempt to 
ret con her collaboration with the Trumpian failure to contain the pandemic. a€oeBirx recalls a 
a€~very
difficulta€™ call with Trump, says hundreds of thousands of Covid deaths were preventablea€!. a€~I 
look at it this way: The first time, we have an excuse. There were about 100,000 deaths that came 
from that original
surgea€™                                                                                            
            , Birx said. a€~All of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or 
decreased substantially a€!a€™ a€oe More than 551,000 Americans have died from the pandemic. She 
should never be allowed to
ret con this from a year ago: Aaron Rupar: a€Da€™ [Trump is] so attentive to the scientific 
literature & the details & the data. I think his ability to analyze & integrate data that comes out 
of his long history in business has
really been a real benefita€™ a€”this is shocking, hackish stuff from Dr. Birx. March 27th 2020a€!

Daniel Reck, Max Risch, & Gabriel Zucman: Tax Evasion at the Top of the U.S. Income Distribution & 
How to Fight If. a€~How much taxes do high-income Americans evade? And what kinds of evasion 
tactics do they
use?a€l In collaboration with researchers at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, we show that 
American taxpayers with incomes in the top 1 percent are much more sophisticated than the other 99 
percent at tax evasion. As a
result, conventional estimates significantly underestimate the income and taxes evaded by the rich. 
Our findings point to several key steps that policymakers could take to combat widespread tax 
evasion by the very top
income earners in the United States. First and foremost is the need for greater fiscal support for 
the IRS. Second, the IRS and Congress can target the ways in which the rich hide their incomes and 
obscure their actual tax
obligations via so-called pass-through businesses and hidden offshore accountsa€!

Daniel P. Egan: Low Cost Is Better than Free. a€~When something is a€~freea€™ the incentives for 
both the consumer and provider change dramatically, often in ways that are invisibly worse for 
consumersa€!. The
biggest success in a€~freea€™ in the past 20 years has been attention merchantsa€!. Finance is an 
asymmetric expertise market. Therea€™ s a lot of complexity/detail in how things work, which means 
that experts can figure
out clever ways to make money off people without the person really understanding that they paid. 
Having more marks who are attracted to a€~freea€™ trading is great for the bottom linea€!

Martin Wolf: The Return of the Inflation Spectre: a€~Growing worries about the return of a 
long-forgotten bugbear highlight increasing risks for saversa€!. Significantly higher inflation 
seems a remote risk. But, after four
decades of well-controlled inflation, the monetary and fiscal policies unleashed by the pandemic, 
as well as longer-term structural changes in the world economy, might ruin this comfortable 
perspective^!. Inflation has not
come back. It may never do so. But the political and shifts we are seeing today, after Covid, 
together with the longer-term changes in the world economy, have raised the chances of an 
inflationary shock of some kind.

Investors must take this possibility into accounta€!

Neil Irwin: If the Economy Overheats, How Will We Know?: a€™ Furman says annual inflation rates of 
3.5 percent or higher in late 2021 or 2022 would a€oecreate a substantial risk of macroeconomic 
reactions that create
genuine instability and problems in the economy ,a€D and that even a notch lower than that, 2.5 
percent to 3.5 percent, could create some problems. Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy 
Perspectives, by contrast, argues
that  it would take several years of inflation at 3 percent or highera€’’not just a bump in 2021 or 
2022 a€” before she would worry that inflation expectations could become unmoored, leading to 
either an inflation-tamping
recession or a 1970s-style vicious cycle of ever-higher prices. a€oelt is strange to me that for 
years economists pined for a better mix of monetary and fiscal policy, and now we have it and there 
is a narrative among some that
it   has to end in disaster,a€D Ms. Coronado said. a€oel am more optimistic about the macro outlook 
than I have been in a long time and am far more focused on how quickly the labor market returns to 
health than any threat
from inflation.a€Ua€!

David Winer: Itd€™ s Not Really a Scam: a€~Writers who may think of themselves of savvy tech 
journos are scammeda€!. They largely did it to themselves by believing the fairy tale that they 
could get rich off writing, or
even make a good livinga€!. I regularly make offers to work with writers on easy writing and 
distribution systems without the constraints. But you all keep going for the tech industry business 
models. They get rich, and
wea€™re always starting over. When you decide you want to do this for real, with your eyes open, 
learning from all the experience, write a manifesto and call for open source devs to help you, and 
then we can get something
going. But until the writers lead here, youa€™re going to keep having your hearts broken and the 
tech for writing on the web will continue to go nowherea€!

Adam Smith: The Theory of Moral Sentiments: a€~The love of our own country seems not to be derived 
from the love of mankind. The former sentiment is altogether independent of the latter.  We do not 
love our country

merely as a part of the great society of mankind: we love it for its own sake, and independently of 
any such consideration. National prejudices and hatreds seldom extend beyond neighbouring nations. 
We very weakly and

foolishly, perhaps, call the French our natural enemies; and they perhaps, as weakly and foolishly, 
consider us in the same manner. Neither they nor we bear any sort of envy to the prosperity of 
China or Japana€!

U.S. Department of the Interior: Americad€™ s Bald Eagle Population Continues to Soar: a€~Bald 
eagles once teetered on the brink of extinction, reaching an all-time low of 417 known nesting 
pairs in 1963 in the lower
48 states. However, after decades of protection, the banning of the pesticide DDT, and conservation 
efforts with numerous partners, the bald eagle population has flourished, growing to more than 
71,400 nesting pairs.
According to scientists from the Servicea€™ s Migratory Bird Program, the bald eagle population 
climbed to an estimated 316,700 individual bald eagles in the lower 48 statesa€!
