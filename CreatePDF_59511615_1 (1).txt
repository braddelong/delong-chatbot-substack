FIRST: Aze Federal Reserve Will Move on Wednesday. What Will/Should It Do?

Brad DeLong: Why the US Federal Reserved€™ s Options Are Limited'. The US Federal Reservea€™ s 
Federal Open Market Committee ought to announce a rate increase that is large enough to bring its 
policy rate to an      optimalneutral-plus level. But it has an even greater interest inadhering to 
its own   forward guidance, implying that it will probably maintain its incremental  approach.
BERKELEY a€“ What policy will the US Federal Reserve announce after the Federal Open Market 
Committeea€™ s two-day meeting this week, and what policy should it announce?

The first question is easy: There is a high probability a€“ 75% a€“ that the Fed will follow its 
previous forward guidance and raise its target for the short-term safe nominal interest rates that 
it controls by 50 basis points, from 0.75a€“l% to 1.25a€“L5%. By validating its previous 
statements, the Fed hopes to steer the economy in the desired direction by shaping expectations of 
future interest rates.

Because this a€cejawboninga€D strategy is effective only insofar as the Feda€™ s forward guidance 
is trusted, building and maintaining that trust is a major policy objective in itself. The Fed 
should deviate from previous forward guidance only if there is substantial evidence that the 
economy is on the wrong track. Currently there is no such evidence. Bond-market expectations of the 
underlying long-run consumer
price index inflation trend remain under 2.5% per year a€“ which is lower than in the prea€“2014 
period, when no rational person had any reason to fear that CPI inflation would soon deviate upward 
from its target.

To be sure, the bond market expects the annual CPI inflation rate to be around 3% over the next 
five years, before falling to its longer-run 2.5% annual trend. Wouldna€™ t that higher rate 
justify additional steps to tighten       monetarypolicy more than was previously expected? No, 
because the   Fed does not merely want to hit its inflationtarget on a year-by-year basis. Rather, 
its primary task is to maintain confidence in the
economya€™ s nominal price-level anchor over time. As long as it is doing that, it has the 
short-run policy freedom to do whatever else is needed to maximize employment and growth.

By contrast, if the Fed were to deviate from its own forward guidance by raising interest rates 
faster than previously planned, it would reduce confidence in its word, and reduce employment and 
growth in the construction, export, and import-competing sectors. A 0.75 percentage-point increase 
carries palpable costs for little gain, implying that there is little chance that the Fed will go 
this far.

The question of what the Fed should do is more difficult. Bond-market expectations (after 
accounting for duration-risk premiums) suggest that the federal funds rate will average about 2.75% 
per year over the next two years, before falling to 2.5% per year over the next decade. In other 
words, markets expect the Fed to raise its policy rate to 3.5% over the next year, and then move on 
to a glide path back down to perhaps
2% a€“ or until something else happens to the macroeconomy. This trajectory implies three 50-bps 
interest-rate increases and four 25-bps increases over the next seven meetings.

The least preferable path is for the Fed to dribble out interest-rate increases in a manner that 
leaves people uncertain about how far it thinks it ultimately will need to go. The far better 
option would be to move immediately to a neutral plus-or-minus federal funds rate a€“ choosing 
a€ceplusa€D if demand seems too high for the Fed to maintain the credibility of the nominal 
inflation anchor in the long run, and
a€oeminusa€n if it thinks that demand is unsustainably low. Optimal control theory dictates that if 
the nose of your sailboat is not pointing where you want to go a€“ if your control is not at the 
optimal level a€“ you should turn the nose as fast as possible until you reach a bearing where you 
can no longer tell whether your next course correction will need to be to the port or to the 
starboard.

What this means for monetary policy is that the Fed should change its target each month so that 
people do not know whether the next move will be up or down. Yes, there is an argument that this 
principle of optimal control theory does not apply to monetary policy: the Fed needs to avoid 
disruptions in the money market. But such disruptions are feared precisely because the Fed never 
makes larger moves.

Moreover, the Fed must conduct monetary policy with the tools and procedures that it has. If it 
raises its policy rate by only 0a€“25 bps this week, even though it wants the federal funds rate to 
be considerably higher, it will have departed from its forward guidance. There is no argument for 
doing that. But it has not prepared the ground for a rate hike larger than 50 bps. That is 
unfortunate. Ideally, the ground would have
been prepared for an increase as high as 200 bps, because that is what it would take to get the 
federal funds rate to an optimal neutral-plus level. But, because that hasna€™t happened, and 
because departing from forward guidance is almost never worth it, there is a 75% chance that the 
Fed will increase its policy rate by 50 bps at its coming meeting a€“ and a 25% chance that it will 
go as high as 75 bps.

Ideally, the @federalreserve would announce an interest-rate hike of 200 basis points to put the 
economy back on an optimal course. But it has not prepared the ground for such an increase, and 
departing from forward guidance is too risky, notes @ delong.

Paragraphs:

Convincing argument that, had the stars and the factor prices been aligned, the steam engine could 
have been invented in 1600. Now I want Anton to teach me about the hydraulic machines of Byzantium:

Anton Howes: Why Wasna€™ t the Steam Engine Invented Earlier? Part I: a€~The technological path to 
the steam engine didna€™ t really have to do with steama€™ s expansive forcea€!. Steam wasa€! 
condensed with a spray of cold water, forming a partial vacuum under the piston. It was the 
suddenly massive relative weight of the atmosphere above this partial vacuum that did all the work.
Ita€™ s why the Newcomen engine is also referred to as an atmospheric enginea€!. The thing that so 
shocked me when reading Salomon de Causa€™ s 1615 work was thata€! he describes in great detail a 
solar-powered steam enginea€! that exploited the expansionary force of steama€! [and] atmospheric 
pressure tooa€i. It may sound like de Causa€™ s machines were trivial amusements, only
operating at a certain time of day, as a sort of trick for fountains and music. True. But he was 
certainly interested, in more general terms, in industrial applications for machinesa€! drainage 
pumps, a way to put out fires, machines to bore wooden pipes, and an astonishingly sophisticated 
lathea€!. So we have a conundrum. A machine with the same core concept as Saverya€™ s steam 
enginea€”
but   far too early to have been influenced by the science of Torricelli, von Guericke, Huygens, 
Boyle, or Papin. Where did de Caus get the idea? And did anyone take them further in the 80 years 
between him and Savery?a€!

Now looking forward with great eagerness to Zack Cartera€™ s forthcoming book on John Stuart Mill:

Zachary D. Carter: Haiti, Slavery & John Stuart Mill: a€~Mill essentially called the Edinburgh 
editors a bunch of rich sellouts who were too selfish to think straight. His most damning piece of 
evidence was an Edinburgh article that had defended Francea€™ s claims on Haiti. The Edinburgh, 
Mill noted with palpable disgust, had implored the people of Britain to support France against the
Haitian Revolution, on the grounds that a new, self-governing Black nation would be dangerous to 
nearby British coloniesa€!. The persuasive force of his rhetoric comes from simply restating the 
Edinburgha€™ s position and declaring (correctly) that it is morally horrendous. The great 
Edinburgh Review, Mill jeered, had been ready to condemn an entire nation a€oeto the alternative of 
death, or
of  the most horrible slavery a€D in order to protect the profits of a few plantation owners. This 
tells us at least four important things about the intellectual climate of the early 19th century. 
First, there were people who regarded what France was doing to Haiti as a great crime, and said so. 
Second, for a substantial population, merely reciting what France had done to Haiti was enough to 
generate
moral outrage. You didna€™ t have to explain to this crowd that it was wrong to enslave human 
beings, or that it was wrong to fight wars in defense of slavery. They knew. Third, there was a 
very detailed spectrum of opinion in 19th century Europe on human rights. Even Milla€™ s targets at 
the Edinburgh explicitly acknowledged a€oethe unmerited sufferings of the unhappy negroesa€D in
Haitia€”they simply denied that righting those wrongs trumped the commercial interests of British 
colonistsa€!. Fourth, and perhaps most important, Milla€™ s missive helps demonstrate the political 
limits of intellectual discourse in the early Liberal era. Some of the most famous minds in Europe 
decried the plundering of Haiti, and it was plundered anyway, and then plundered again, and
again.     Not because nobody knew any better, or because plundering was inevitable, but because 
people with power really wanted to do it. Therea€™ s much more that could be said, of course, but 
thata€™ s what the book is fora€!
