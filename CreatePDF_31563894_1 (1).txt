Worthy Reads from Equitable Growth:

1.The big news breaking right now is the Biden-Harris Administration^™ s $1.9 billion Rescue plan, 
itself only the first tranche, as it will be followed by a subsequent Recovery plan of equal or of 
greater size. I want to wait to talk about that until I have a better sense of the pathway to 
legislative passage. Biden-Harris is not repeating The mistake that Obama made over and over again: 
setting out what he thought would be a reasonable consensus compromise
as his opening bid, and then letting Boehner and McConnell bargain him back to something that was 
all but indistinguishable from the moderate Republican position. In many cases, with the Obama 
legislative affairs effort, we were rescued only because the Democratic Left and the Republican 
Right united in rejecting the moderate Republican positiona€“the Democratic Left because it was bad 
policy, and the Republican Right because it involved offering
Obama respect.

But I digress.

What I mean to say is this: Biden-Harris appear to be in the groove. But I want to wait to see a 
little bit more before I talk about their plans. So, in the meantime, go watch and read the very 
excellent joint project of Equitable Growth and Berkeleya€~s Labor Center on how to boost wages 
here in America:

Equitable Growth: Boosting Wages for U.S. Workers in the New Economy < 
https://equitablegrowth.org/boosting-wages-for-u-s-workers-in-the-new-economy-book/ >: a€~The U.S. 
labor market is shackled by decades of wage stagnation for the majority of workers, persistent wage 
disparities by race, ethnicity, and gender, and sluggish economic growth. The steady increase of 
income inequality since the 1970s leaves generations of U.S. workers and their
families unable to cope with the daily costs of living, let alone save for emergencies or invest in 
their futuresa€’’conditions that have left many families ill-prepared for the a€oestress testa€D of 
the coronavirus recession. These labor market ills particularly affect women and workers of 
colora€l. There is increasing evidence that broad structural inequality leads to a misallocation of 
talent and the undervaluation of different types of work, which contributes to
anemic economic growth and slower productivity gains. Boosting Wages for U.S. Workers in the New 
Economy, a joint effort of Equitable Growth and the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment 
at the University of California, Berkeley, presents a series of essays from leading economic 
thinkers, who explore alternative policies for boosting wages and living standards, rooted in 
different structures that contribute to stagnant and unequal wagesa€l

2. Here is, I think, the most interesting idea about how to boost wages in America I have seen 
recently. It comes from my colleague Benjamin Schoeffer. He proposes a framework of bargained 
sector-wide minimum wages for different worker skill levels. This has the possibility of getting us 
more quickly to wage levels that the market would eventually reach after he sustained period of 
high-pressure growth, and thus make growth more equitable:

Benjamin Schoefer: Collective bargaining as a path to more equitable wage growth in the United 
States < 
https://equitablegrowth.org/collective-bargaining-as-a-path-to-more-equitable-wage-growth-in-the-uni
ted-states/ >: a€~Rising wage inequality in the United States means that the median wage has not 
kept pace with the mean wage in recent decades. Moreover, the United States has performed worse in 
this regard than many of its international peersa€l. I
will first examine the decoupling of median wage growth from mean wage growth and, in turn, the 
decoupling from productivity growtha€l. I will then consider the role of collective bargaining 
institutions in these patternsa€l. Finally, I will review policies the United States could pursue 
that have the potential to foster more equitable wage growtha€! industrywide and cross-industry 
wage boards to set minimum wages for workers in the middle rungs of the wage
distribution, not just those on the lower rungsa€l. The coronavirus recessiona€l has led to a 
uniquely slack labor market among many segments of the economy and has hurt the bargaining position 
of many low-wage workers in particular. Without strong and sustained wage growth that is broadly 
distributed across the U.S. labor force, the eventual economic recovery will almost certainly take 
longer to reach the vast majority of U.S. workersa€l

3.1 am becoming increasingly scared that there will be no further recovery until vaccination has 
proceeded far enough that we are within shouting distance of herd immunity.

claims and the crisis in the labor market continues, initial regular claims have once again 
surpassed the Great Recession peak. States reported that another 284,470 workers filed for initial 
PUA, which extended UI to some workers who are not eligible for regular benefits. In total, 1.4 
million workers filed initial PUA or regular unemployment benefits last week.
Regular continued claims, also referred to as insured unemployment, rose to 5.8 million the week

4. Both the Reagan and the George W. Bush recessions landed the labor market In a deep hole. But, 
while the Reagan recession was followed by the Reagan boom, the George W. Bush recession was 
followed by the extraordinarily anemic Obama recovery. I believe there are very powerful lessons to 
be drawn. And I believe that Biden-Harris, the Democratic congressional caucuses, and the 
Republican congressional caucuses should take bold steps to learn from
what worked in generating the Reagan recovery. And I say so, over at DeLong today:

Brad DeLong: DeLongTODAY: What Comes After HIa€”Herd Immunitya€”Dayfor the Economy? < 
https://www.delongtoday .com/ >: So how do we get the Reagan rather than the Obama recovery? We got 
the Reagan recovery through aggressively expansionary monetary policy: because Paul Volker at the 
Federal Reserve responded with rapid and enormous interest rate cuts. We got it through 
aggressively expansionary fiscal policy: because Reagana€™ s
wanting to heat up the Cold War produced massive defense spending increases...

a€!The first act was firms re-opening and recalling furloughed workers. The second act is harder: 
Millions lost their jobs permanently &amp; there aren't many new opportunities opening up for them. 
The second act is a grim slog. Payrolls in November rose a mere +245k. That's the sort of number 
you might see in a "normal" month, and definitely not what you're hoping for in the snapback from a 
covid-induced shutdown. Remember, the economy lost 22
million jobs, then gained roughly half of them back. We still have 10 million fewer jobs than we 
did in February. Clawing the rest back at +245k per month will take basically forever. If this is 
the second half of the recovery, it's going to be grim.... The economy is in a deep holea€”as deep 
as in the darkest days following the financial crisisa€”and the recovery is faltering. Barely 
there. Making no progress. Stalled. Stopped.  The virus is back, which hobbles the

service sector, and stimulus has basically petered out.... The household survey suggests that 
employment actually declined (by -74k) last month. So the fall in unemployment from 6.9% to 6.7% 
largely reflect the fact that an additional 400k people dropped out of the labor force.... We're 
already seeing the recessionary impulse from state and local governments cutting back.  Over half 
of this month's job growth is in the stay-at-home-because-of-the-virus

sectora€!

4. The very intelligent Michael Schuman believes that the reign of Xi Jinping may well be a 
disaster for Chinaa€™ s future economic growth. So far, China has managed to hit the sweet spot 
between market, forward-looking industrial-policy guidance, and command-and-control to keep 
financial flows that would be totally unsustainable in a neoliberal market economy somehow in 
balance. This has been an extremely complex balancing act. Michael thinks that
Xi Jinping does not understand how it has been accomplished. He is focused on cementing his power 
and eliminating any possibilities of the growth of strong forces pushing for political 
liberalization. Achieving those goals may well be incompatible with maintaining the balance that 
has produced such rapid economic growth.

On the other hand, China has done many things over the past four decades that outside observers, 
especially those of us of even slightly neoliberal persuasion, thought would be impossible:

Michael Schuman: The Undoing ofChinaa€™s Economic Miracle <https 
://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/01/xi-jinping-china-economy-jack-ma/617552/?=> : 
a€~The countrya€™ s paramount leader is turning away from reforms that helped it grow and develop. 
That will have consequences beyond its borders: Chinaa€™ s economic a€oemiraclea€n wasna€™ t that 
miraculous. The countrya€™ s high-octane ascent over the past 40 years
is, in reality, a triumph of basic economic principles: As the state gave way to the market, 
private enterprise and trade flourished, growth quickened, and incomes soared. This simple lesson 
appears, however, to be lost on Xi Jinpinga€!. Classically trained economists frown upon Xia€™ s 
program. Hea€™ s ticking just about every box of what not to do to propel incomes and innovation. 
Yet we shouldna€™ t immediately dismiss his plans as doomed to fail. As a
gargantuan market of 1.4 billion people, China can develop local companies of size and scope 
without bothering much with the outside world. (Maa€™ s Ant is a prime example.) If the program 
works, economists may have to rewrite their textbooks. Yet the undertaking is fraught with risks. 
By favoring the state sector, Xi is funneling valuable money and talent to notoriously bloated and 
inefficient government enterprises instead of far more nimble and creative
private firms. The negative effect shows up in miserably poor productivity a€”a disaster for an 
aging society still catching up with the richest nationsa€”and mounting debt, now nearly three 
times the size of national outputs I. Xi is preparing for protracted conflict between the worlda€™ 
s two largest economies by attempting to fireproof China from measures President-elect Joe Biden 
might use against him. Yet in doing so, he is also repositioning the Chinese
economy in the worlda€!

5. OK. For the second half of my reads from outside Equitable Growth, it is time for me to step 
outside my wheelhouse again.

I think that the smart Matthew Yglesias is 100% right here. He says that the fact that we still 
have a democracy is the result not of the strength of American political institutions but of 
American society, and of the willingness of key actors to step outside the bounds and norms of our 
constitution when necessary. We had, it turns out, just enough people who were patriots first and 
proceduralists second. They outweighed the bad actors acting badly. But it was a
close thing. And I still do not understand why the Maryland national guard was held up at Takoma 
Park for 90 minutes, and how they were finally given permission to move into DC:

Matthew Yglesias: The System Doesna€™ t Work <https://www.slowboring.eom/p/the-system-doesnt-work>: 
a€~To look at this situation and conclude that a€oethe system workeda€D would be a huge mistake. 
What happened is that the system did not work, and several actors in key positions inside the 
system simply chose to disregard it. Theya€™ ve been backed in this regard by other actors in 
American society. A bunch of business leaders came out
publicly against efforts to overturn the election. Both Facebook and Twitter have deactivated 
Trumpa€™ s accounts. Arguably more importantly, while the official conservative position seems to 
be that the social media companies are doing the wrong thing, the President is not currently live 
on Fox News denouncing his enemies. Has he forgotten that he has other communications channels 
available besides twitter, or is Fox declining to book him? The Murdoch-
owned Wall Street Journal has already called for Trump to resign, which I think is perhaps an 
indication that while Fox hosts will continue doing anti-anti-Trump stuff for ratings they are not 
actually interested in continuing the struggle. All of this is to say that whata€™ s working, to 
the extent that anything is working, is that American society, and the American State, are capable 
of working around the flawed design of the system when in a crisis. But the
system  as designed does not work, and the solution may not be as elegant next time. Ita€™ s 
important for everyone to keep that in mind, in case things ever go far enough off the rails that 
we need to start all over againa€!

6. For the people who I talk to regularly, the fact that anyone is attracted to and convinced by 
Donald Trump is completely inexplicable. He is a lying conman. Anyone who believes him on anything 
is an easily-grifted moron.

Yet I can understand and get how people find Bill Clinton so persuasive. I grok it. I feel it 
myself when I have been in the same room with him. I have to make a mental effort to remember that 
I have a purpose in that room, and that it is probably not well-served by becoming starry-eyed and 
enthusiastically agreeing with Bill Clinton. I remember Obama having the same impact before 
2010a€“although, curiously, not since.
But Trump is so completely, obviously, phony. And fake. And out to manipulate you. So where is the 
attraction coming from? Yes, 40 million people voted for him because you always pull the lever for 
the Republican. But there are 35 million more who are enthusiastic Trump supporters. Why?

And do Ron Rosenbauma€™ s and William Shirera€™ s reflections on Germany in the 1930s have any 
relevance?:

Ron Rosenbaum: Explaining Hitler < https://books.google.com/books?id=xLoOUyOiNOUC >: a€~I found 
myself impressed with Shirera€™ s reportera€™ s eye. For Hitler. For the still inexplicable power 
of the a€oespell.a€na€!. Those who were eyewitnesses, those who were ear witnesses as wella€! all 
somehow knew something beyond the ken of those who experienced it secondhand. There is a phrase I 
neglected to use in the first edition:
FA^hrerkontakt. The transformative personal charisma that turned his rival, Berlin-based Goebbels, 
into a gibbering sycophant in a single meeting, according to Goebbelsa€™ s own diary. 
FA'Ahrerkontakt that had mind-scrambling effects on august German General Staff strategists and 
radiated out from the inner circle to all those tens of thousands in Sportzplatz- and 
Nuremberg-style rallies within the sound of his voice, the access to his appearances in real
time. Different, almost incomprehensible, to those of us consigned to a remote viewinga€!

7. Still well outside my wheelhouse: Noah Smith thinks the key is the desire of Fox News, Facebook, 
and Twitter to sell ads to gullible right-wing audiences, and their discovery that the best way to 
do that is to terrify their audiences. Plus there are the other bad actors: those who want 
donations from gullible right-wing audiences, and have also discovered that the best way to do that 
is to terrify them. Until we find a way to D platform this Particular bunch of
slick suit-wearing domestic cyberterrorists, we are going to have grave governmance and 
public-sphere problems in this society:

Noah Smith: Short Thoughts on the Insurrection < 
https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/insurrection-thoughts-113 >: a€~I think Republicans who still 
support the insurrectionistsa€”or who are still on the fencea€”are motivated not by hate but by 
fear. To understand the mind of American conservatives, you have to understand the constant diet of 
fear that they consume every day. For decades, right-wing talk shows and Fox News have understood 
that they could
get conservatives to tune in by constantly pumping up the feara€”fear of a War on Christmas, fear 
of gay culture, fear of terrorism, fear of Black crime, fear fear fear. During the Trump Era, the 
chief bugaboos have been A) wokeness, B) immigration, and C) antifa. To be a conservative in 
America is to exist in a constant state of having people trying to scare you. Now, in the era of 
Trumpist insurrection, the chief threat that the fearmongers are hawking is that
Republicans and conservatives will become a persecuted class in America.  Some Republicans will see 
this threatening warning and think a€oeEhh, thata€™ s hysteria; leta€™ s focus on the real threat 
of insurrection and then things will be back to normal.a€D But some will think a€oeOMG ita€™ s 
truea€!. Ia€™ m going to be hunted and persecuted in my own country just because Ia€™ m a 
conservative^!. Who can protect me from this terror?a€D And

for many, the only possible answer to the question of a€oeWho can protect me from this terror?a€D 
will be a€oeTrump, and the people who stormed the Capitola€D. Having been told that the 
institutions of America are an existential threat to them, they will cling to the only force they 
feel might be capable of protecting them.  All the insurrectionists have to do to retain Republican 
support is to keep pumping up the threat, and keep presenting themselves as

the only port in the storm. And some Republicans, tragically, will cling ever tighter to the very 
monster that is at their throats...

8. The other way I like of putting this thought is Alasdair Greya€™ s: a€oework as though you were 
living in the early days of a better nationa€D (itself an adaptation of Dennis Leea€™ s a€oebest of 
all is finding a place to be in the early years of a better civilizationa€D). But this is, perhaps, 
more optimistic, hence more true:

Ken Untener: Prophets of a Future Not Our Own < 
https://www.usccb.org/praver-and-worship/pravers-and-devotions/prayers/prophets-of-a-future-not-our-
own >: a€~It helps, now and then, to step back and take a long view. The kingdom is not only beyond 
our efforts, it is even beyond our vision. We accomplish in our lifetime only a tiny fraction of 
the magnificent enterprise that is God's work. Nothing we do is complete, which is a way of saying 
that the
Kingdom always lies beyond us. No statement says all that could be said. No prayer fully expresses 
our faith. No confession brings perfection. No pastoral visit brings wholeness. No program 
accomplishes the Church's mission. No set of goals and objectives includes everything. This is what 
we are about. We plant the seeds that one day will grow. We water seeds already planted, knowing 
that they hold future promise. We lay foundations that will need further
development. We provide yeast that produces far beyond our capabilities. We cannot do everything, 
and there is a sense of liberation in realizing that. This enables us to do something, and to do it 
very well. It may be incomplete, but it is a beginning, a step along the way, an opportunity for 
the Lord's grace to enter and do the rest. We may never see the end results, but that is the 
difference between the master builder and the worker. We are workers, not master
builders; ministers, not messiahs. We are prophets of a future not our owna€!

FA^hrerkontakt. The transformative personal charisma that turned his rival, Berlin-based Goebbels, 
into a gibbering sycophant in a single meeting, according to Goebbelsa€™ s own diary. 
FA'Ahrerkontakt that had mind-scrambling effects on august German General Staff strategists and 
radiated out from the inner circle to all those tens of thousands in Sportzplatz- and 
Nuremberg-style rallies within the sound of his voice, the access to his appearances in real
time. Different, almost incomprehensible, to those of us consigned to a remote viewinga€!

7. Still well outside my wheelhouse: Noah Smith thinks the key is the desire of Fox News, Facebook, 
and Twitter to sell ads to gullible right-wing audiences, and their discovery that the best way to 
do that is to terrify their audiences. Plus there are the other bad actors: those who want 
donations from gullible right-wing audiences, and have also discovered that the best way to do that 
is to terrify them. Until we find a way to D platform this Particular bunch of
slick suit-wearing domestic cyberterrorists, we are going to have grave governmance and 
public-sphere problems in this society:

Noah Smith: Short Thoughts on the Insurrection < 
https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/insurrection-thoughts-113 >: a€~I think Republicans who still 
support the insurrectionistsa€”or who are still on the fencea€”are motivated not by hate but by 
fear. To understand the mind of American conservatives, you have to understand the constant diet of 
fear that they consume every day. For decades, right-wing talk shows and Fox News have understood 
that they could
get conservatives to tune in by constantly pumping up the feara€”fear of a War on Christmas, fear 
of gay culture, fear of terrorism, fear of Black crime, fear fear fear. During the Trump Era, the 
chief bugaboos have been A) wokeness, B) immigration, and C) antifa. To be a conservative in 
America is to exist in a constant state of having people trying to scare you. Now, in the era of 
Trumpist insurrection, the chief threat that the fearmongers are hawking is that
Republicans and conservatives will become a persecuted class in America.  Some Republicans will see 
this threatening warning and think a€oeEhh, thata€™ s hysteria; leta€™ s focus on the real threat 
of insurrection and then things will be back to normal.a€D But some will think a€oeOMG ita€™ s 
truea€!. Ia€™ m going to be hunted and persecuted in my own country just because Ia€™ m a 
conservative^!. Who can protect me from this terror?a€n And

for many, the only possible answer to the question of a€oeWho can protect me from this terror?a€n 
will be a€oeTrump, and the people who stormed the Capitola€D. Having been told that the 
institutions of America are an existential threat to them, they will cling to the only force they 
feel might be capable of protecting them.  All the insurrectionists have to do to retain Republican 
support is to keep pumping up the threat, and keep presenting themselves as

the only port in the storm. And some Republicans, tragically, will cling ever tighter to the very 
monster that is at their throats...

8. The other way I like of putting this thought is Alasdair Greya€™ s: a€oework as though you were 
living in the early days of a better nationa€D (itself an adaptation of Dennis Leea€™ s a€oebest of 
all is finding a place to be in the early years of a better civilizationa€D). But this is, perhaps, 
more optimistic, hence more true:

Ken Untener: Prophets of a Future Not Our Own < 
https://www.usccb.org/praver-and-worship/pravers-and-devotions/pravers/prophets-of-a-future-not-our-
own >: a€~It helps, now and then, to step back and take a long view. The kingdom is not only beyond 
our efforts, it is even beyond our vision. We accomplish in our lifetime only a tiny fraction of 
the magnificent enterprise that is God's work. Nothing we do is complete, which is a way of saying 
that the
Kingdom always lies beyond us. No statement says all that could be said. No prayer fully expresses 
our faith. No confession brings perfection. No pastoral visit brings wholeness. No program 
accomplishes the Church's mission. No set of goals and objectives includes everything. This is what 
we are about. We plant the seeds that one day will grow. We water seeds already planted, knowing 
that they hold future promise. We lay foundations that will need further
development. We provide yeast that produces far beyond our capabilities. We cannot do everything, 
and there is a sense of liberation in realizing that. This enables us to do something, and to do it 
very well. It may be incomplete, but it is a beginning, a step along the way, an opportunity for 
the Lord's grace to enter and do the rest. We may never see the end results, but that is the 
difference between the master builder and the worker. We are workers, not master
builders; ministers, not messiahs. We are prophets of a future not our owna€!
