SUBJECT: Winston Churchill Anticipated U.S.-British-Russian Post-WWII Condominium, Not Cold War:

In some ways, the most remarkable thing about Winston Churchill's March 1946 "Iron Curtaina€n 
speech is how peacenik and un-Cold War a document it is:


READING: Winston Churchill: Iron Curtain Speech

Winston Churchill (March 5,1946): Iron Curtain Speech: a€~President McCluer, ladies and gentlemen, 
and last, but certainly not least, the President of the United States of America: I am very glad 
indeed to come to Westminster College this afternoon, and I am complimented that you should give me

It begins by painting an extremely bright future of the worldwide end of poverty and privation 
a€oein the next few decadesa€Da€”an a€oeexpansion of material well-being beyond anything that has 
yet occurred in human experienced□:

aCcePoverty and privationa€l are in many cases the prevailing anxiety. But if the dangers of war 
and tyranny are removed, there is no doubt that science and cooperation can bring in the next few 
years, certainly in the next few decades, to the world, newly taught in the sharpening school of 
war, an expansion of material well-being beyond anything that has yet occurred in human experience. 
Now, at this sad and breathless moment, we
are plunged in the hunger and distress which are the aftermath of our stupendous struggle; but this 
will pass and may pass quickly, and there is no reason except human folly or sub-human crime which 
should deny to all the nations the inauguration and enjoyment of an age of plenty. I have often 
used wordsa€! froma€! Bourke Cockran, a€oeThere is enough for all. The earth is a generous mother; 
she will provide in plentiful abundance
food                                                                                                
                                                                                                    
 for all her children if they will but cultivate her soil injustice and peace.a€D So far I feel 
that we are in full agreementaCI

It warns of the necessity of building the Temple of Peace, and welcomes Russiaa€”even Stalina€™ s 
Russiaa€”into it as a peer great power, and states a willingness on the part of the western allies 
to establish lasting friendship with aCcethe valiant Russian peoplea€l [our] wartime comrade[s]a€D 
for whom we must and do have a€oestrong admiration and regarda€D. Moreover, there is the will to 
persevere in the attempt to establish such friendship
aCcethrough many differences and rebuffsa€D:

I spoke earlier, ladies and gentlemen, of the Temple of Peacea€!. It may collapsea€!. Dark ages may 
return, the Stone Age may return on the gleaming wings of science, and what might now shower 
immeasurable material blessings upon mankind, may even bring about its total destruction. Beware, I 
say; time may be short. Do not let us take the course of allowing events to drifta€!.

I have a strong admiration and regard for the valiant Russian people and for my wartime comrade, 
Marshall Stalin. There is deep sympathy and goodwill in Britaina€”and I doubt not here 
alsoa€’’towards the peoples of all the Russias and a resolve to persevere through many differences 
and rebuffs in establishing lasting friendships. We understand the Russian need to be securea€!. We 
welcome Russia to her rightful place among the
leading nationsa€! her flag upon the seasa€! constant, frequent and growing contacts between the 
Russian people and our own peoplea€!

And only then, after the speech is half done, do we hear:

It is my duty to place before you certain factsa€!. From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the 
Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across the Continenta€!. [In] the Soviet spherea€! all are 
subjecta€! to a very high and, in some cases, increasing measure of control from Moscowa€!. Police 
governments are prevailing in nearly every case, and so far, except in Czechoslovakia, there is no 
true democracya€!. Whatever conclusions may be
drawn from these factsa€”and facts they area€”this is certainly not the Liberated Europe we fought 
to build up. Nor is it one which contains the essentials of permanent peaceaC!. In front of the 
iron curtaina€! are other causes for anxietya€!. Communist parties or fifth columns constitute a 
growing challenge and peril to Christian civilizationa€!. The outlook is also anxious in the Far 
East and especially in Manchuria. The Agreement
which was made at Yalta, to which I was a party, was extremely favorable to Soviet Russiaa€!

But, Churchill says, hot war or cold war can be avoided in a straightforward manner. How? By the 
American-British alliance, and then by diplomacy:

I repulse the idea that a new war is inevitable; still more that it is imminenta€!. I do not 
believe that Soviet Russia desires war. What they desire is the fruits of war and the indefinite 
expansion of their power and doctrinesa€!. They will not be removed by mere waiting to see what 
happens; nor will they be removed by a policy of appeasement. What is needed is a settlement, and 
the longer this is delayed, the more difficult it will be and
the greater our dangers will becomea€!. Our Russian friends and Alliesa€! there is nothing for 
which they have less respect than for weaknessa€!. If the Western Democracies stand together in 
strict adherence to the principles will be immense and no one is likely to molest thema€!. We must 
not let [world war] happen again. This can only be achieved by reaching now, in 1946, by reaching a 
good understanding on all points with Russia
under the general authority of the United Nations Organizational.

Then, once that aCcegood understanding^□ with Russia based on the non-weakness of the alliance of 
the United States and British Empire is reached:

There will be no quivering, precarious balance of power to offer its temptation to ambition or 
adventure. On the contrary there will be an overwhelming assurance of securitya€!. If all British 
moral and material forces and convictions are joined with your own in fraternal association, the 
highroads of the future will be clear, not only for our time, but for a century to come.

Paragraphs:

But, Noah, the Right winga€™ s economic plan was completely wrong. a€oeStarving the beasta€D (a) 
creamed public investment and substantially slowed productivity growth, and (b) in a high 
interest-rate capital-scarce environment, the crowding-out of private investments by government 
deficits was a very real and damaging thing. Plus the dollar cycles absolutely creamed American 
manufacturing, and lost us large chunks of our drive that generated positive
engineering external spillovers. So why is it worse that the right has no plan today? Doesna€™ t 
no-plan beat bad-plan?

Noah Smith: What is the Righta€™ s Economic Plan?'. a€~In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the 
conservatives who took over the country did have an economic plan (my favorite history of this, by 
the way, is Rick Perlsteina€™ s Reaganland)^\ cut taxes, cut spending, cut regulation. Get the 
government out of the way and the private sector will prosper. This program, promulgated in stump 
speeches and direct mail campaigns and the
Wall Street Journal and even on PBS, helped Republicansa€™ electoral fortunes, giving voters a 
vision in which to invest their hopes for a more prosperous future. But even more importantly, it 
also gave direction to economic policy for three decadesa€!. Ultimately, of course, excessive 
financial deregulation produced an epic crash in 2008. Tax cuts failed to pay for themselves and 
ballooned the deficit, and by the early 2000s they were
clearly failing to have any noticeable effect on business investment or growth. Lack of a robust 
welfare state means inequality is much higher in the U.S. than in most other rich countries. Many 
would now argue that the U.S.a€™ lack of a real industrial policy allowed China to drain away much 
of our manufacturing base in the 2000sa€!

Yes. Journalists have lost their moral compass as a key part of the cognitive synapses of a strong 
Great Republic. They dona€™ t care, and see no reason why they should:

Duncan Black: Off The Record: a€~If youa€™re a political reporter and, OFF THE RECORD, a senator 
says, a€oel fa€”ing hate Donald Trump, the man should be tried for treason,a€D and then 3 weeks 
later appears with Trump at a rally that youa€™re covering and says, a€oel LOVE DONALD TRUMP HE IS 
AMERICAa€™ S GREATEST PATRIOT,a€D and then you print that quote without any other context, how 
exactly are
you informing readers? My little example is just an example to make a broader point. Ita€™ s all 
like that.

and:

James Fallows: What People Might Remember from Nerd Prom 2022: a€~What will be remembered from 
Trevor Noaha€™ s performance last night was its conclusion. You can see it as delivered here. Below 
is the part I want to concentrate on, the very end. With my emphasis added: a€oe Whether you like 
it or not, [the press] is a bastion of democracy. And if you ever begin to doubt your 
responsibilities, if you ever begin to doubt how
meaningful it is, look no further than whata€™ s happening in Ukrainea€!. You realize how amazing 
it is like in America you have the right to seek the truth and speak the truth. Even if it makes 
people in power uncomfortable even if it makes your viewers or your readers uncomfortable. 
Understand how amazing that is. I stood here tonight and I made fun of the President of the United 
States and Ia€™ m going to be fine. Ia€™ m going
to be fine. Right? [Gestures to Biden, in a joking way. Biden claps.] Do you really understand what 
a blessing it is?a€!. Honestly, ask yourself this question: If Russian journalists who are losing 
their livelihoods and their freedom for daring to report on what the own government is doinga€! If 
they had the freedom to write any words, to show any stories, to ask any questionsa€”if they had 
basically what you havea€”would they be using
it in the same way that you do? Ask yourself that question every daya€!
