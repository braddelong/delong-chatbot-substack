Herbert Hoover published his memoirs in 1952. So perhaps there is some retrospective rightward 
drift in his recollections of what he thought back in 1928a€”but only some: he did give the 
anti-collectivist speech that he quotes at length here.

And yet Al Smitha€™ s pre-Great Depression Democratic Party was not at all a a€oecollectivista€D 
party. As Hoover points out, it was the Bourbon aristocracy of the South combined with the urban 
machines and with agrarian, consumer, and labor anti-monopolist groups. Labor unions and consumer 
and farming cooperatives were as far as
they went toward a€oecollectivisma€n. The socialists of the day were Eugene V. Debsa€”Robert La 
Follettea€’’Norman Thomas. Not John Dewey.

And I do have to point out that Hoovera€™ s dismissal of the claim that he a€oewas supposed to have 
robbed a Chinamana€n plays fast and loose with the reality. Hoover could never decide whether his 
line was that Kaiping mine General Manager Chang Yenmao was a thief whom Hoover had rightfully 
displaced from his position, or
whether he, Hoover, had done his best in cooperation with Chang Yenmao and the two of them had then 
been double-crossed by Hoovera€™ s Belgian-British partners. In any event, the Belgian-British 
syndicate (and Hoover!) wound up putting no money into the enterprise and yet reaping a 62.5% 
ownership share, while the previous equity
holders who had held 100% before the restructuring wound up with only 32.5%. Nice work I you can 
get it.

Let me give the mic to Hoover:

Under the leadership of William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic party had undertaken to ride the 
three horses of the extreme conservatism in the Solid South, the radical labor and agrarian groups 
of the North and the corrupt city machines. Governor Smith inherited this complex and was anxious 
to retain the support of these Northern groups.

While the Governor conscientiously believed in the American system, he was not philosophically very 
discriminating. Some assurances had been given to Senator Norris and John Deweya€™ s socialist 
group that the government would go into the power business. Also the Governor had submitted to 
pressures from the radical agricultural
group to advocate price-fixing schemes in farm products. There was certainly a large ideological 
range in Governor Smitha€™ s team of supporters. Aside from the radical groups of the North, and 
the conservatives of the South, it embraced at the same time such personalities as Pierre DuPont, 
Senator Norris, and New Jersey boss, Frank
Hague.

The United States already was being infected from the revolutionary cauldrons of Europe. This had 
become so evident that I had written a small book on the subject some six years before.2 In any 
event, the growing left-wing movement, embracing many of the a€ceintelligentsia,a€D flocked to 
Governor Smitha€™ s support.
I was determined that the Republican party should draw the issue of the American system, as opposed 
to all forms of collectivism.

Our managers thought that the subject was not of much importance or public interest, and that 
harping on it carried liabilities. However, I felt that this infection was around, and I dealt with 
it definitely in an address in New York on October 22,1928. A few paragraphs have some interest in 
view of later events:
There has been revived in this campaign, however, a series of proposals which, if adopted, would be 
a long step toward the abandonment of our American system and a surrender to the destructive 
operation of governmental conduct of commercial businessa€!.

You cannot extend the mastery of the government over the daily working life of a people without at 
the same time making it the master of the peoplea€™ s souls and thoughts. Every expansion of 
government in business means that government in order to protect itself from the political 
consequences of its errors and
wrongs is driven irresistibly without peace to greater and greater control of the nationa€™ s press 
and platform. Free speech does not live many hours after free industry and free commerce die.

It is a false liberalism that interprets itself into the government operation of commercial 
business. Every step of bureaucratizing of the business of our country poisons the very roots of 
liberalising’’that is, political equality, free speech, free assembly, free press, and equality of 
opportunity. It is the road not to more
liberty, but to less liberty. Liberalism should be found not striving to spread bureaucracy but 
striving to set bounds to it. True liberalism seeks all legitimate freedom first in the confident 
belief that without such freedom the pursuit of all other blessings and benefits is vain. That 
belief is the foundation of all American
progress, political as well as economic.

Liberalism is a force truly of the spirit, a force proceeding from the deep realization that 
economic freedom cannot be sacrificed if political freedom is to be preserved. Even if governmental 
conduct of business could give us more efficiency instead of less efficiency, the fundamental 
objection to it would remain
unaltered and unabated. It would destroy political equality. It would increase rather than decrease 
abuse and corruption. It would stifle initiative and invention. It would undermine the development 
of leadership. It would cramp and cripple the mental and spiritual energies of our people. It would 
extinguish equality of
opportunity. It would dry up the spirit of liberty and progress.

For these reasons primarily it must be resisted. For a hundred and fifty years liberalism has found 
its true spirit in the American system, not in the European systems>1 do not wish to be 
misunderstood in this statement. I am defining a general policy. It does not mean that our 
government is to part with one iota of its
national resources without complete protection to the public interest. I have already state that 
where the government is engaged in public works for purposes of flood control, of navigation, of 
irrigation, of scientific research or national defense, or in pioneering a new art, it will at 
times necessarily produce power or
commodities as a by-product. But they must be a by-product of the major purpose, not the purpose 
itself.

Nor do I wish to be misinterpreted as believing that the United States is free-for-all and 
devil-take-the-hindmost. The very essence of equality of opportunity and of American individualism 
is that there shall be no domination by any group or combination in this republic, whether it be 
business or political. On the
contrary, it demands economic justice as well as political and social justice. It is no system of 
_laissez faire_.

I feel deeply on this subject because during, the war I had some practical experience with 
governmental operation and control. I have witnessed not only at home but abroad the many failures 
of government in business. I have seen its tyrannies, its injustices, its destructions of 
self-government, its undermining of the
very instincts which carry our people forward to progress. I have witnessed the lack of advance, 
the lowered standards of living, the depressed spirits of people working under such a system. My 
objection is based not upon theory or upon a failure to recognize wrong or abuse, but I know the 
adoption of such methods
would strike at the very roots of American life and would destroy the very basis of American 
progressa€!.

The American people from bitter experience have a rightful fear that great business units might be 
used to dominate our industrial life and by illegal and unethical practices destroy equality of 
opportunity.

Years ago the Republican administration established the principle that such evils could be 
corrected by regulation. It developed methods by which abuses could be prevented while the full 
value of industrial progress could be retained for the public. It insisted upon the principle that 
when great public utilities were
clothed with the security of partial monopoly, whether it be railways, power plants, telephones, or 
what not, then there must be the fullest and most complete control of rates, services, and finances 
by government or local agencies. It declared that these businesses must be conducted with glass 
pocketsa€!.

The Republican party insisted upon the enactment of laws that not only would maintain competition 
but would destroy conspiracies to destroy the smaller units or dominate and limit the equality of 
opportunity amongst our peoplea€!.

And what have been the results of our American system? Our country has become the land of 
opportunity to those born without inheritance, not merely because of the wealth of its resources 
and industry but because of this freedom of initiative and enterprise. Russia has natural resources 
equal to ours. Her people are
equally industrious, but she has not had the blessings of one hundred and fifty years of our form 
of government and of our social systema€!

CAMPAIGN DIRT: The lower rank and file of party workers on both sides did not show the elevation of 
spirit one could desire.

The Democratic underworld made a finished job at these low levels with several favorite libels. 
Again the litigation in London, wherein I was supposed to have robbed a Chinaman, was exploited. 
However, that gave rise to a boomerang from an unexpected quarter. The principal Chinese owner of 
the properties in question was Tong Shao-yi,
to whom I have referred in the preceding volume of these memoirs. He had now risen to be Prime 
Minister of his country. Suddenly Tong appeared in the American press with an indignant statement 
from China that this story was a€cedastardly,a€D that his family were the principal owners, that he 
had been enormously benefited by my
services on that occasion. He otherwise expressed himself warmlya€!
