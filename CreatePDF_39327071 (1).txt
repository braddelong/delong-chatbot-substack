9) For a long time, Friedman argued that any policy that kept what he called the quantity of money 
a€’’checking account deposits, plus cash, plus small and immediately accessible
savings depositsa€’’growing at a constant pacea€”would, if followed consistently and religiously, 
produce an inflation- and high unemployment-free economy. But as Charles
Goodhart had warned him, the correlations he relied on between the money stock and spending broke 
down as soon as central banks started to try to rely on them as control
mechanisms. See Charles Goodhart, a€oeProblems of Monetary Management: The U.K. Experienced □, 
Reserve Bank of Australia Papers in Monetary Economics 1 (1975)

So Friedman then took refuge in a a€oeyou know it when you see ita€D position. In 2000 he said: 
a€oeJapan[a€™ s]a€! situation is very cleara€!. Monetary growth has been too
lowa€!. The Bank of JapanaC! [should] buy long-term government securities, and they can keep buying 
them and providing high-powered money until the high-powered money
starts getting the economy in an expansion. What Japan needs is a more expansive domestic monetary

13) Eisenhower, Letter to Edgar.

But did Eisenhower represent a consensus, or was he himself a powerful actor who returned American 
conservatism to sanitya€”for a whilea€”by forcing underground and into
silence the leaders who wanted to destroy all the works of THAT COMMUNIST ROOSEVELT? Joe McCarthy 
had real power in the Republican Party in the first half of the
1950sa€”Trumpa€™ s hold on the party in the early 2020s is a reasonable analogy, for Republicans 
were as scared to cross McCarthy then as, say, Mike Pence is to cross Trump
and     condemn Trump for welcoming plans to lynch Pence on January 6,2021. Republican Senate 
majority leader Robert Taft was quite a right-wing case in himself. The
Republicans chose Eisenhower as their standard-bearer because they wanted to maximize their chances 
of winning. And Eisenhower devoted himself to curbing the crazy swamps.
But  even Eisenhower made the Democrats and the press do the heavy anti-McCarthy lifting. Plus Earl 
Warren in his old age turned out to be a very different kind of Republican
than anyone before would ever have imagined he would or could be.

There is a counterfactual in which AmericaaC™ s politics of the 1950s looks a lot more like the 
Nixonian early 1970sa€’’break the country in half and come away with the larger
halfa€”or the Trumpist late 2010sa€”break the country in half and come away with the smaller half.
