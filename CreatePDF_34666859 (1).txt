1) On what an America with 1 billion Americans would look like: a lot more row houses and small 
apartment buildingsa€’’triple deckers, etc:

Noah Smith: I Have Seen the Future of Housing: a€~I recently went to visit my friends who just 
moved to Seattle. I stayed in their rented row house in an upscale neighborhood called Queen Anne. 
And it was there that I saw a vision of the future of housing in Americaa€!. There are lots of 
single-family homes in Queen Annea€!. Ina€! Lower Queen Anne, height limits were raised to allow 
more apartment buildings, helping to spark a
building booma€! Opponents of the a€oejust build more housinga€D approach often fret that density 
will turn their neighborhoods into Manhattana€!.

Personally, I think it would be cool to have more American cities sport ultra-dense downtowns like 
NYC or Tokyo. But that just isna€™ t whata€™ s in the cards herea€!. The way to densify America is 
to build more housing in the suburbsa€!. The future of American housing densification probably 
looks less like San Fransokyo, and more like the village-like half-city half-suburb areas that the 
New Urbanist movement always wanteda€!
modest densificationa€! [that] leaves a€oeneighborhood charactera€D intacta€!. The ciassist and 
often racist exclusion that Americans generally demand from their local housing policies will be 
preserveda€!. And that sucks. Ia€™ m sorry. I wish better things were possible, and I hope that 
someday they will be. And we need to keep fighting for those better things.

BUT. That doesna€™ t mean the type of densification I saw in Queen Anne is worthless, or 
counterproductive. It can help make cities better for lower-income residentsa€!. Fitting more 
high-income people into the same area will raise property tax revenue (especially in places that 
dona€™t have Californiaa€™ s ridiculous Prop 13). More property tax equals more money for public 
schoolsa€! transita€! to subsidize affordable
housinga€!. Modest, incrementalist densification of Americaa€™ s tony suburbs is far less than 
YIMBYs hope for, and ita€™ s nowhere near enough to restore a semblance of fairness to Americaa€™ s 
housing regime. But ita€™ s better than what existed beforea€!. For now, Ia€™ 11 take ita€!

2) The people who advised Obama to bargain against himself so many times, to make his initial 
negotiating position what he wanted the endgame to be, to presume that Republicans who said they 
wanted a bipartisan deal actually meant ita€”who were they, and where are they now, and why arena€™

explicitly, just how much Obama fa€”- up: a€oeWH CoS Ron Klain says Biden admin will try to get GOP 
votes for the infrastructure plan but a€~in the end the president was elected to do a joba€™ . Very 
similar rhetoric to what they used in pushing the $1.9 trillion relief plana€la€D The thing is, I

3) Germany as Exportweltmeister uninterested in taking on any responsibility for the cooperative 
world order:

Quinn Slobodian: How Germany Created the Neoliberal Order: a€~Julian Germann suggestsa€! [that] 
Germany is an export nation and would like to stay that way with as little internal disruption as 
possiblea€!. It is in the defense of its status as Exportweltmeister, Germann argues, that we can 
find the explanation for German actions. The country has never sought to create a€oereplica 
Germanys according to a single ideological
blueprint,a€D as has sometimes been alleged. On the contrary, its goal has been an entrenchment of 
difference on the formula of a€oesocial market economy for me but not for theea€D. The black-zero 
fetish, in other words, is not the twisted expression of Lutheranism but an all-too-reasonable 
attempt to maintain export-oriented growth while maintaining a class compromise at homea€!

4) American conservatives are now longer merely fascist-adjacent. Let me say that they do not speak 
for America, or for my settler-colonist ancestors:

Zack Beauchamp: New Claremont Essay Reveals How Republicans Are Rejecting America: a€~The 
right-wing rebellion against American democracy is often subtle, expressing itself through tricky 
changes to election law without a full-throated acknowledgment of what lawmakers are actually 
doing. But sometimes, the mask slipsa€”and someone in the conservative movement openly tells you 
whata€™ s really going on. One such
slippage took place last weeka€!. a€oeMost people living in the United States todaya€’’certainly 
more than halfa€”are not Americans in any meaningful sense of the teim,a€D Glenn Ellmers, the 
essaya€™ s author, writesa€!. If Trump voters and conservatives do not band together and fight 
a€oea sort of counter-revolution,a€D then a€oethe victory of progressive tyranny will be assured. 
See you in the gulag.a€D What exactly this
counter-revolution entails is unclear, but Ellmers has some tips. a€oeLearn some useful skills, 
stay healthy, and get strong,a€D he writes. a€oeOne of my favorite weightlifting coaches likes to 
say, a€~Strong people are harder to kill, and more useful generallya€™ a€Ua€!

5) A very expensive policy indeed:

Kris James Mitchener, Kirsten Wandschneider, & Kevin HjortshAJ Oa€™Rourke: The Smoot-Hawley Trade 
War: a€~We document the outbreak of a trade war after the U.S. adopted the Smoot-Hawley tariff in 
June 1930. U.S. trade partners initially protested the possible implementation of the sweeping 
tariff legislation, with many eventually choosing to retaliate by increasing their tariffs on 
imports from the United States. Using
a new quarterly dataset on bilateral trade for 99 countries during the interwar period, we show 
that U.S. exports to countries that protested fell by between 15 and 22 percent, while U.S. exports 
to retaliators fell by 28a€“33 percent. Furthermore, using a second new dataset on U.S. exports at 
the product-level, we find that the most important U.S. exports to retaliating markets were 
particularly affected, suggesting a possible mechanism
whereby the U.S. was targeted despite countriesa€™ MEN obligations. The retaliatorsa€™ welfare 
gains from trade fell by roughly 8a€“17%a€!
