The fact that core inflation is rising on the back of substantial GDP growth and declining 
unemployment should not come as a surprise. Those who are wringing their hands about economic 
"overheating" should remember that an absence of price increases would reflect an economy that is 
still struggling, <https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-inflation-shows-economy-is-

BERKELEY a€“ The financial and economic news in the United States lately has been dominated by 
concerns about inflation. a€oeRunaway inflation is the biggest risk facing investors, Leutholda€™ s 
Jim Paulsen warns,a€D according to the cable news channel CNBC. As a potential hedge against 
inflation, a€oeBitcoina€™ s time to shine is fast
approaching ,a€D rvportsFortunea€ ™ s Robert Hackett. According to US News and World Report, 
a€oeThere is a lot of talk about inflation in 2021 as fears of high government spending creep in 
and the recent rebound in prices from pandemic-related levels has some investors worried that the 
trend will continue for some time.a€D

And yet, one also reads that a€oeUS Treasury yields hold ground even as inflation picks up.a€D 
After growing at an annualized rate of 33.4% in the third quarter of 2020,4.3% in the fourth 
quarter, and 6.4% in the first quarter of this year, the US economy is on track for a full 
recovery. The second-quarter growth rate is expected to be at least 8%, and perhaps significantly 
higher, which
means that the US economy, in aggregate, will have fully returned to its pre-pandemic production 
level by the third or fourth quarter of this year.

In this context, it is no surprise that core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) rose 
0.4 percentage points over the past month. That rate implies nearly a 5% annual inflation rate. But 
looking back over the past 12 months, the core inflation rate (as measured by the consumer price 
index) was 2.3%, which is in keeping with the US Federal Reservea€™ s 2-2.5% target.

The question is not whether there will be some inflation this year, but whether it will represent 
a€ceoverheatinga€D of the economy as a whole. Most likely, it will not. The amount by which 
economic output in 2021 exceeds potential output will be less than zero. And as the Fed makes clear 
with every statement it issues, it will not allow a transient wage-price spiral to become
embedded in inflation expectations. The outlook for 2021 and beyond is that inflation will hover 
around the Feda€™ s target, rather than consistently falling short, as it has for the past 13 
years.

Moreover, the US economy is emerging from the pandemic recession with a fundamentally altered 
inter-sectoral balance. Spending on durable goodscurrently accounts for an additional 1.7 
percentage points of GDP, relative to its 2019 level, and spending on housing construction is 
running at 0.5 points above its 2019 share. At the same time, business spending on
structures and consumer spending on energy are both running at 0.5 points below their 2019 shares, 
and spending on services (hospitality, recreation, and transportation) is 2.2 points below its 2019 
share.

These sectoral dynamics will be the most important determinants of inflation this year. By the end 
of 2021, some 4% of all workers will have moved not only to new jobs but to entirely different 
sectors. In an economy where businesses very rarely cut nominal wages, the pull of workers from 
sectors where demand is relatively slack to sectors where it is more intense will require firms to
offer wage increases to encourage workers to make the jump.

But we cannot know how much inflation this reshuffling will cause, because we have not really seen 
anything like it before. Economists will have a lot to learn this year about the short-term 
intersectoral elasticity of employment supply.

One thing that should be clear, however, is that an uptick of inflation this year is nothing to be 
upset about. After all, wage and price increases are an essential part of rebalancing the economy. 
Real production, real wages, and real asset values will all be higher as a result of this yeara€™ s 
inflation, whereas the price level will remain far below what it would have been had the Fed
managed to hit its inflation targets in the years since the Great Recession following the 2008 
global financial crisis.

While some commentators worry that we may be returning to the 1970s, this is highly unlikely. That 
decadea€™ s stagflationary conditions followed from a perfect storm of shocks, and were exacerbated 
by the Feda€™ s conflicted and confused response under then-Chair Arthur Burns. Todaya€™ s Fed 
leadership is very different, and there is no perfect storm of repeated shocks to
match the effects of the Yom Kippur War, Irana€™ s Islamic Revolution, the 1970s 
productivity-growth slowdown, and so forth.

Burning rubber to rejoin highway traffic is not the same thing as overheating the engine.
