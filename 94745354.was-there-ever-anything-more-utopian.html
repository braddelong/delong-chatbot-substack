The... capitalist mode of production, was incompatible with the feudal... privileges... [of]] individuals, entire social ranks and local corporations... [and] hereditary ties of subordination.... The bourgeoisie broke up the feudal system and built upon its ruins... free competition, of personal liberty, of the equality, before the law, of all commodity owners....</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>• Now modern industry... comes into collision with the... capitalist mode of production.... To concentrate... scattered, limited means of production, to enlarge them, to turn them into the powerful levers of production of the present day — this was precisely the historic role of capitalist production....</p><p>• The bourgeoisie... transform[ed]... them... into <em>social</em> means of production only workable by a collectivity.... The yarn, the cloth, the metal articles that now come out of the factory were the joint product of many workers, through whose hands they had successively to pass before they were ready. No one person could say of them: "I made that; this is <em>my</em> product."... Now arose division of labor upon <em>a definite plan</em>, as organized in the factory.... Socialized production revolutionized all the old methods of production. But... it found ready-made, and made liberal use of... merchants' capital, handicraft, wage-labor. Socialized production thus introducing itself as a new form of the production of commodities.... The socialized producers and means of production and their products were still treated... as the means of production and the products of individuals....

To the extent that wages have risen because workers <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t13.htm">have moved to better jobs</a>, the extra income should not be inflationary because the additional spending power would be commensurate with the additional value being generated….

There’s a pause; there’s some repose.” That was true for, like, an afternoon?… Consider this a postscript to “The Crypto Story.”… If you are playing a game, you might not take it very seriously. You might call up your trader buddies at your old firm and say, “Hey, come over here, it’s so fun, we can just make stuff up, and the money is good,” but you will not call up the compliance people at your old firm and say that. For one thing, that is not an appealing pitch to compliance people. For another thing, the compliance people are what made your old firm less fun, always nagging you about compliance. Now you don’t need to comply! Now you get to make stuff up. Same with accountants, it turns out. It’s very hard for crypto firms to produce audited financial statements… If you are running a scam, you will be drawn to crypto. You are running a confidence game, and crypto offers the most efficient market for turning confidence into money. “These people just made these tokens up and sold them for money,” you will say to yourself. “How do I get in on that?”… Crypto’s toy financial system managed to have itself a toy financial crisis… worse, faster and dumber and more complete than the global financial crisis of 2008…. Banks and savers mostly did not lose money, because banks and savers mostly steered clear of crypto, because it was so obviously unregulated and full of scams…. A cleverly designed exchange for trading magic beans will never get around the basic problem that the magic beans don’t work, and people might stop believing in them. If crypto is going to work in the long run, it will need to prove its real usefulness outside of finance…</p><p></p><p></p>
