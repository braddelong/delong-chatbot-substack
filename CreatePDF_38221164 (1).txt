Paragraphs:

Phil Libin: Lessons for CEOs: a€~Imagine a parallel universe where we never had to commute before, 
and I came in and said, a€oeListen up guys, I need you to waste two hours of your day sitting in 
traffic. No, you
wona€™ t get any work done, no, it wona€™ t be time spent with your friends or family, and yes, 
ita€™ s terrible for the environment, but two hours a day, you have to sit in traffic.a€D 
Essentially thata€™ s what
companies   are asking employees to do by telling them to come back to the office. So rather than 
saying that wea€™re only doing this because we have to, think about the amazing new powers we have, 
and how much better
our  lives are if we embrace thema€!

Paul Krugman: Zach Carter has a characteristically fascinating article on Milton Friedman and his 
fading legacy. Somehow I never appreciated how Friedman started from right-wing politics, and built 
a reputation as a
technical economist to serve that cause. Carter talks about the declining influence of Friedman's 
economic doctrines, but maybe I can add a little, having done some of this myself and also having 
watched macro evolve over
40 yearsa€!

permit Guangdong to
make its own foreign trade policy decisions and to invite foreign investment to projects in 
experimental areas along the provincial border with Hong Kong and Macau and in Shantou, which has a 
large overseas diasporaa€!.
Deng added, a€oeThe Central Government has no funds, but we can give you some favorable 
policies.a€Da€I In July 1979, the party center and State Council approved the creation of the first 
four special economic
zonesa€!

Joseph B. Bak-Coleman & al.: Stewardship of Global Collective Behavior: a€~Information flows were 
initially shaped by natural selection yet are increasingly structured by emerging communication 
technologies. Our
larger, more complex social networks now transfer high-fidelity information over vast distances at 
low cost. The digital age and the rise of social media have accelerated changes to our social 
systems, with poorly understood
functional consequences. This gap in our knowledge represents a principal challenge to scientific 
progress, democracy, and actions to address global crises. We argue that the study of collective 
behavior must rise to a
a€oecrisis disciplined □ just as medicine, conservation, and climate science have, with a focus on 
providing actionable insight to policymakers and regulators for the stewardship of social systemsd!
