Heinrich Heine: The Silesian Weavers:

a€~Their gloom-enveloped eyes are tearless,
They sit at the spinning wheel, snarling cheerless:

"Germany, we weave your funeral shroud,
A threefold curse be within it endowed-
Wea€™re weaving, wea€™re weaving!

A curse on God to whom we knelt

When hunger and wintera€™ s cold we felt,
To whom we flocked in vain and cried,

Who mocked us and poxed us and cast us aside,
Wea€™re weaving, wea€™re weaving!

A curse on the king, the wealthy mena€™ s chief
Who was not moved even by our grief

Who wrenched the last coin from our hand of need,
And shot us, screaming like dogs in the street!

Wea€™re weaving, wea€™re weaving!

A curse on this lying father-nation

Where thrive only shame and degradation,

Where every flowera€™ s plucked ere ita€™ s bloom
And worms thrive in the dank rot and gloom-
Wea€™re weaving, wea€™re weaving!

O shuttle fly! Loom crank away!
We weave unfailing, night and day-

Old Germany, we weave your funeral shroud,
A threefold curse be within it endowed-
Wea€™re weaving, wea€™re weaving!
