For example, consider <strong>Friedrich Engels</strong> (1884) on the relative autonomy of the state…</p><p>First, he glosses the <em>Communist Manifesto’s</em> “the executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie”—“Die moderne Staatsgewalt ist nur ein Ausschuß, der die gemeinschaftlichen Geschäfte der ganzen Bourgeoisklasse&nbsp;verwaltet”—“the modern state is nothing but an association for managing the affairs of the business class”:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Friedrich Engels</strong> (1884): <em>The Relative Autonomy of the State</em> &lt;&lt;<a href="https://www.bradford-delong.com/2020/03/friedrich-engels-1884-_the-origin-of-the-family-private-property-and-the-state_-the-state-is-normally-the-stat.html">https://www.bradford-delong.com/2020/03/friedrich-engels-1884-_the-origin-of-the-family-private-property-and-the-state_-the-state-is-normally-the-stat.html</a>&gt;&gt;: ‘The state... is normally the state of the most powerful, economically ruling class, which by its means becomes also the politically ruling class, and so acquires new means of holding down and exploiting the oppressed.... The ancient state was, above all, the state of the slave-owners for holding down the slaves, just as the feudal state was the organ of the nobility for holding down the peasant serfs and bondsmen, and the modern representative state is the instrument for exploiting wage-labor by capital.</p></blockquote><p>But Engels finds that the <em>Communist Manifesto’s</em> 1848 formulation is not adequate toward any productive discussion of what was to him modern politics and of political strategy. And so in 1884 Engels issues a very important qualification indeed:</p><blockquote><p>Exceptional periods, however, occur when the warring classes are so nearly equal in forces that the state power, as apparent mediator, acquires for the moment a certain independence in relation to both. This applies to the absolute monarchy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which balances the nobility and the bourgeoisie against one another, and to the Bonapartism of the First and particularly of the Second French Empire, which played off the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie against the proletariat. The latest achievement in this line, in which ruler and ruled look equally comic, is the new German Empire of the Bismarckian nation; here the capitalists and the workers are balanced against one another and both of them fleeced for the benefit of the decayed Prussian cabbage-aquires.</p></blockquote><p>In short, “modern state-power is an association for managing the common affairs of the entire bourgeoisie” needs to be strongly qualified in every case Engels runs up against in his day:</p><p>Moreover, there is another qualification that Engels finds necessary: In the “low stage” of state development,&nbsp; property in its form of the extraction of resources is closely tied to the power to say what the law is and will be—to jurisdiction directly, to legislation, or to the choice of magistrates. But just as the modern market economy makes everyone formally equal in their economic rights, so the “highest stage” state—the democratic republic— makes everyone formally equal in their political rights:</p><blockquote><p>Further, in most historical states the rights conceded to citizens are graded on a property basis, whereby it is directly admitted that the state is an organization for the protection of the possessing class.... This political recognition of property differences... marks a low stage in the development of the state. The highest form of the state, the democratic republic, which in our modern social conditions becomes more and more an unavoidable necessity and is the form of state in which alone the last decisive battle between proletariat and bourgeoisie... no longer officially recognizes differences of property.</p></blockquote><p>But in Engels’s eyes formal equality is in fact the opposite of substantive equality, because of simple corruption and, indirectly, “by an alliance between the government and the stock exchange”:</p><blockquote><p>Wealth here employs its power indirectly, but all the more surely. It does this... by plain corruption of officials... and by an alliance between the government and the stock exchange, which is effected all the more easily the higher the state debt mounts and the more the joint-stock companies concentrate in their hands not only transport but also production itself…. In addition to America, the latest French republic illustrates this strikingly, and honest little Switzerland has also given a creditable performance in this field.</p></blockquote><p>And the control of the government by the stock exchange is not limited to democratic republics:</p><blockquote><p>But that a democratic republic is not essential to this brotherly bond between government and stock exchange is proved not only by England, but also by the new German Empire, where it is difficult to say who scored most by the introduction of universal suffrage, Bismarck or the Bleichröder bank.</p></blockquote><p>It is, however, not completely clear to me what Engels is pointing to as this “alliance between the government and the stock exchange”. Today it is very clear: in the public sphere the government’s performance is scored by the media and by the well-thinking by whether stocks go up or not. But this was not true, or not true to the same degree, back in 1884.</p><p>Finally, Engels needs to reassure the faithful, and to say that, in spite of what he sees around him, eventually the New Jerusalem will descend from the Heavens, adorned like a bride:</p><blockquote><p>The oppressed class... the proletariat... in the measure in which it matures towards its self-emancipation... constitutes itself as its own party and votes for its own representatives, not those of the capitalists.... On the day when the thermometer of universal suffrage shows boiling-point among the workers, they as well as the capitalists will know where they stand…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;&lt;<a href="https://www.bradford-delong.com/2020/03/friedrich-engels-1884-_the-origin-of-the-family-private-property-and-the-state_-the-state-is-normally-the-stat.html">https://www.bradford-delong.com/2020/03/friedrich-engels-1884-_the-origin-of-the-family-private-property-and-the-state_-the-state-is-normally-the-stat.html</a>&gt;&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>5) John W.

Born in 1924, he  went to college, got drafted, in the closing days of World War II joined the American Communist Party, went to graduate school at what is now Case Western Reserve, and in 1949 published his dissertation, the definitive biography of Eugene V. Debs: Ray Ginger, <em>The Bending Cross: A Biography of Eugene V. Debs</em> (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1949 &lt;https://archive.org/details/bendingcrossbiog00gingrich/&gt;, that then won him a job at Harvard Business School as editor of the Business History Review. But then in 1954 the U.S. House Committee on Unamerican Activities came knocking. Harvard fired him when he would not sign an oath declaring that he was not a member of the Communist Party, and would only pay him his final two weeks’ salary if he, his wife, and their newborn left the state immediately.</p><p>The stress broke his marriage. He worked in the second half of the 1950s in advertising and as a book editor, during those years writing two great books, <em>Altgeld’s America</em> about turn-of-the-1900s-Chicago, and <em>Six Days or Forever?</em> about the Tennessee Scopes monkey trial. In 1960, Brandeis University hired him as an assistant professor. They promoted and tenured him. His students later endowed Brandeis’s Ray Ginger Chair in History.</p><p>He left Brandeis in 1966 to become a visiting professor at Stanford. Universities—Wayne State, Calgary—would hire him with tenure. He died of alcoholism in Boston in 1975. All of his books are very much worth reading.</p><div><hr></div><p>15) John Peter Altgeld, <em>Our Penal Machinery and Its Victims</em>, Chicago: A.C.
