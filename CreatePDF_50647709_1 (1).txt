BRIEFLY NOTED: For 2021-05-12 We; + A Guess at the State of the Plague in India, & the Right Wing 
Long Con

First:

A Snippet from a Dialogue: The Current Plague in India:

Axiothea: How much worse are things in India than the statistics the Indian government is reporting 
say?

Parmenides: We do think that here in the United States we have had 900,000 rather than 600,000 
deathsa€”out of a total caseload of perhaps 60 million, perhaps 120 million. How bad are things in 
India right now, really? And how bad are they going to get?

Aesclepius: We do not know. We guess that true plague deaths are between three and eight times 
officially recorded deaths. And we guess that India is only halfway through this current plague 
wave.

Axiothea: If so, note that India currently is at 200 reported deaths per milliona€”say the true 
number is 1000,0.1% of the population, and it is going to double before this wave is through. With 
a population of 1.4 billion, that would be 3 million dead by the time this wave ebbsa€l

The Right-Wing Short Con:

With Americaa€™ s right wing, it is always, always the grift. Always:

Paul Campos: Josh Hawley, Grifter: a€~I clicked on the link so you dona€™t have to, and discovered 
that my $75 contribution will keep happening every month automatically unless I unclick an already 
helpfully checked box that makes my contribution recurring. Also too unless I unclick another 
already clicked box I will make yet another $75 contribution on May 15th, to help stem the yellow 
red black brown tide of Joe Bidena€™ s
and Chuck Schumera€™ s and Nancy Pelosia€™ s Radical Left agenda. As always, Rick Perlsteina€™ s 
now nine-year-old essay on the Long Con remains essential reading, although I suspect Sen. Hawley 
himself is strictly short-time, as they say in the racketsa€l

federal government^!. The second piece of the Biden plan anticipates
this. It would tax at death unrealized capital gains that exceed $1 milliona€!. Only a very small

Leonard E. Burman: Biden Would Close Giant Capital Gains Loopholesa€”At Least For The Rich: 
a€~Critics of Bidena€™ s proposal have several complaints. None hold water. Critics worry that 
raising capital gains taxes would lower the after-tax return for individual investors and drive 
down stock prices. However, taxable individuals hold less than one-third of corporate stock. The 
rest is owned by nonprofits, retirement plans, life insurance companies, and
foreignersa€”none of whom pay individual income taxes on US capital gains and dividendsa€!

Cory Doctorow: a€™ Seriously. Like Clarkea€™ s Third Law/indistinguishable from magic Amazing. How 
amazing? Well, compared to conventional vaccine production, mRNA factories are: 99a€“99.9% smaller, 
95a€“99.7% cheaper, 1,000% faster. If you convert a single closet in a conventional factory to mRNA 
production, it will make more doses than the rest of the factory COMBINED. Only part of the factory 
needs to be a high-spec cleanroom facility,
and the rest can be cheaper and more easily maintained. Spend $20m to build one of these 
microfactories, install a 51 bioreactor, and, for $100m/year, it will produce ONE BILLION VACCINE 
DOSESa€!

John Maynard Keynes: The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money: a€~Even apart from the 
instability due to speculation, there is the instability due to the characteristic of human nature 
that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than on a 
mathematical expectation, whether moral or hedonistic or economic. Most, probably, of our decisions 
to do something positive, the full consequences of which will
be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as a result of animal spiritsA"a€”of a 
spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of 
quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities. Enterprise only pretends to itself 
to be mainly actuated by the statements in its own prospectus, however candid and sincere. Only a 
little more than an expedition to the South Pole, is it based on an exact
calculation of benefits to come. Thus if the animal spirits are dimmed and the spontaneous optimism 
falters, leaving us to depend on nothing but a mathematical expectation, enterprise will fade and 
die;A"a€’’though fears of loss may have a basis no more reasonable than hopes of profit had before. 
It is safe to say that enterprise which depends on hopes stretching into the future benefits the 
community as a whole. But individual initiative will only be adequate
when reasonable calculation is supplemented and supported by animal spirits, so that the thought of 
ultimate loss which often overtakes pioneers, as experience undoubtedly tells us and them, is put 
aside as a healthy man puts aside the expectation of deatha€!
