Key Insights:

1. Putina€™ s decision to invade came as a great surprise to everyone.

2. The information flow to Putin is very bad, very low quality.

3. Muscovy, St. Petersburg, Novgorod, Minsk, Kyiv are all a€~Rus.

4. But the cultural, political, and linguistic differences between Kyivan and Muscovite a€~Rus are 
surprisingly deep, historically speaking.

5. Economic sanctions can do a lot to degrade Russiaa€™ s war-fighting machine, and should be used 
to do so.

6. Bounties and rewards for defectors and for the neutralization of equipment might be very 
effective, and should be promoted.

7. Countries and rA©gimes run on myth, and military defeat is the most effective way that a 
pernicious myth gets destroyed.

8. Be afraid, be very afraid: Putina€™ s survivala€”his personal political, the causes he has 
invested his life in, and perhaps his mortala€’’depend on his a€cewinninga€D in some sense.

Why Russia will lose this war? Much of the "realist" discourse is about accepting Putin's victory, 
cuz it's * guaranteed*. But how do we know it is? I'll argue that analysts 1) overrate Russian army 
2) underrate Ukrainian one 3) misunderstand Russian strategy & political goalsdY§^

podcast playera€” using Apple's text-to-speech feature for a€~Stacks that do not have attached 
audio podcasts. It has, so far, been a very very good experience.
