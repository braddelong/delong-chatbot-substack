Right from the Start?: What Milton Friedman Can Teach Progressives

Milton Friedman: A Biography, by Lanny Benstein a€^ Palgrave Macmillan a€0 2007 a€0 272 pages a€0 
$27.95

Lanny Ebensteina€™ s Milton Friedman: A Biography comes out at what is both a bad and a good time 
for us. We mourn the loss of the biographya€™ s subject, who died last November. And we will never 
now know what the late libertarian economist thought about the booka€”which is too bad, because his 
thoughts would have been lively, instructive, and optimistic about us and our future. Nevertheless, 
Ebensteina€™ s unintentional
timing is fortuitous because it provides a well-thought-out, if largely biased, roadmap for any 
discussion of Friedmana€™ s legacy. And while that legacy will inevitably be more appreciated by 
those on the right, and in particular those with a strong libertarian leaning, it would be wrong 
for his purported intellectual adversaries to give him the short shrift.

As a first-class intellect, Friedman provides us with a worthy adversary, one that challenges our 
assumptions and prescriptions, and in so doing prods us to improve ourselves and our ideas. But, 
while he is rightly credited with providing intellectual impetus to the riseof the right in 
thelatter half of the twentieth century, healso leavesbehind a surprisingly liberal legacy. Indeed, 
manyof his ideas, most notably thea€oenegative taxa€D (later
adopted as the Earned Income Tax Credit), have become central parts of the liberal policy agenda. 
Which means that, while Friedman will always occupy a place in the conservative intellectual 
history, he should receive credit from liberals as well.

Ebenstein covers a lot of material with an engaging, lively style, and he does so in a relatively 
short space. And there is a lot to cover. His subject was one of the top handful of professional, 
technical research economists in the second half of the twentieth century; oneof the very best and 
most open-minded teachers,someone whotruly understood the value of a diversified intellectual 
portfolio, and that educationwasabout the growth of the
student rather than the cloning of the teacher; among the top echelon of public intellectuals; and, 
as many fellow economists and policymakers knew well, one of the most lively and curious dinner 
partners.

Milton Friedman was born in 1912 in New York City to immigrant parents. Somewhat surprisingly for a 
libertarian, he always called himself one of the worlda€™ s supremely a€celuckya€Da€’’rather than 
a€oeskillfula€n or a€oemeritoriousa€na€’’people, having managed, despite his familya€™ s relative 
poverty, to graduate from Rutgers University at the start of the Great Depression, before going on 
to get a mastera€™ s in

economics from the University of Chicago in 1933. Like many young profes- sors at the time, he 
couldna€™ t make an academic career during the Depression; he was let go by the University of 
Wisconsin, probably primarily for being Jewish. But he did not despair of making a go at being an 
economist. In the late 1930s he hooked up with the National Bureau of Economic Researcha€™ s Simon 
Kuznets and Arthur Burns, worked for the

U.S. Treasury during World War II (where he was one of the designers of our current system of 
income-tax withholding), earned his Ph. D. from Columbia University in 1946, and finally landed on 
his feet at the University of Chicago.

Back then, Friedman was relatively liberal in the American sense. He had trust and confidence in 
the market, yet he also thought that Franklin Roosevelta€™ s New Deal, while destructive in a 
considerable part of its detailed policies, was worth doing. He believed that it was, on balance, a 
positive contribution to economic recovery. Nevertheless, there are more than hints of the later 
libertarian in his doctoral dissertation, entitled
a€oelncome from Independent Professional Practice .a€D

Friedmana€’’correctlya€’’viewed the high incomes of independent professionals as being, to a 
considerable degree, the moral equivalent of a racketeering enterprise: Using the government to 
seize control over licensing under color of guarantee- ing high quality standards, the true aim of 
professional licensing was to restrict entry (especially of religious, ethnic, and racial 
minorities) and so guarantee high incomes to a favored few.
Generalizing from this study would underpin all of Friedmana€™ s arguments when cornered: 
a€oeYes,a€D he would say when debating opponents who thought they had him trapped, a€oethis market 
may be failinga€”but any attempt to use government to fix it will only make matters worse.a€D

Friedman rapidly became the intellectual leader of the macroeconomic wing of the Chicago faculty, 
otherwise known as the monetarist winga€”those economists who focused on the banking system and the 
money supply as the keys to understanding the dynamics of inflation and unemployment. By 1951 he 
was already a superstar, having won the John Bates Clark Medal, awarded every second year to the 
outstanding American economist
under 40. The next 15 years recorded his meteoric rise to the top of his profession: 1953 saw him 
publish his Essays in Positive Economics', in 1956, he edited Studies in the Quantity Theory of 
Money, the book that restored Chicago School monetarism to respectability in technical economics; 
in 1957, he published Theory of the Consumption Function', 1962 saw the birth of Friedman the 
public intellectual with Capitalism and Freedom', in
1963, together with Anna J. Schwartz, he wrote Monetary History of the United States; and in 1967 
he gave his landmark American Economic Association presidential address, a€oeThe Role of Monetary 
Policy.a€D

Relatively early in his Chicago days, Friedman swung to the libertarian edge of the political and 
economic spectrum, having, in his later words, woken up to reality. I dona€™ t want to say to the 
right: drug liberalization, an end to the military draft, civil rights, government out of the 
bedroom, and free immigration were not right-wing causes even then. But in any case, by the early 
1950s, his respect for even the possibility of government
action was gone. His grudging approval of the New Deal was gone, too: Those elements that werena€™t 
positively destruc- tive were ineffective, diverting attention from what Friedman now believed 
would have cured the Great Depression, a substantial expansion of the money supply. The New Deal, 
Friedman concluded, had been a€oethe wrong cure for the wrong disease.a€D

Ebenstein covers this as a triumphal march, as the victory of rationality and truth, first in 
Friedmana€™ s mind and then in his influence over the broader world, as Chicago became the dominant 
school within American economics, supplanting the high posta€“World War II tide of American social 
democracy.

But to do so, Ebenstein papers over the inconsistencies, conflicts, and errors of Friedmana€™ s 
thought. Regardless of how intelligent and influential he was, Friedman was the first to 
acknowledge his critics, and an even-handed biography would have done the same. Including 
criticisms against him also would have helped explain to those on Friedmana€™ s left why he matters 
to us. Namely, we are interested in Friedman as intellectual
adversarya€”where his arguments are strong enough to make the reality-based among us rethink our 
positions and change our minds, and where his arguments lead us to strengthen and better understand 
our own. As John Stuart Mill wrote in his a€oeEssay on Coleridge,a€D every liberal should pray for 
an intelligent conservative intellectual adversary: a€oeLord, enlighten thou our enemies. Sharpen 
their wits, give acuteness to their
perceptions,    and consecu- tiveness and clearness to their reasoning powers: we are in danger 
from their folly, not from their wisdom; their weakness is what fills us with apprehension, not 
their strength.a€D Milton Friedman was the answer to our prayers.

Part of what made Friedman a worthy adversary for American liberals was that he had a fully formed 
worldview, one that started with a bedrock commitment to people, to their ability to make judgments 
for themselves and to decide what they like best. Out of this commitment grew an imperative to 
maximize individual freedom. On top of that came the judgment that free markets are almost always 
the silver bullet to solve all of
societya€™ s problems, as well as a powerful conviction that the facts, if honestly examined, will 
always be on his side. And on top of that was layered a fear and suspicion of govern- ment as an 
easily captured tool for the enrichment of the cynical and powerful, who grab what they can.

Friedman hated government and society sticking their nose into peoplea€™ s pri- vate business. He 
scorned government regulation of all kindsa€’’regulators were, he thought, inevitably captured by 
those they were supposed to regulate. As a result, they regulated not in the public interest but in 
the interest of the com- panies where they hoped to get jobs when they left the government. He 
hated big government spending. He hated budget
deficitsa€’’cynical politicians could use them to pretend that the costs of government were less 
than they were and push into the future the raising of taxes to pay for spending into the future. 
He sought to inoculate citizens against such political games of three-card-monte: a€oeRemember,a€n 
he would say, a€oeto spend is to tax.a€D

Whata€™ s more, Friedman sharply parted from his own teacher, Henry Simons, and from an earlier 
Chicago tradition that had seen big business as a force as dangerous as big government. Simons had 
thought that the anti-trust wing of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ought to be the most 
important arm of government, dedicated to breaking up monopolies so that no American was ever in 
the position of having to accept the terms they
dictated. Friedman and his generation at Chicago disagreed. FTC lawyers, they thought, would make 
sure that anti-trust policies as actually implemented would do more harm than good. It was better, 
they thought, to let the market deal with things itself: Where there was a monopoly making big 
profits, there was an incentive for clever people to find a way to compete with it. And if the 
profits werena€™ t big enough to attract entry by
competitors, then potential competition had already pulled the monopolya€™ s fangs and rendered it 
harmless.

But this antipathy toward the state masks a Friedman more amenable to contemporary liberal values. 
For Friedman hated governments’’except when he didna€™ t. To be sure, the generation of 
libertarians to follow Friedman wanted to eliminate government completely. Have a dispute with your 
neighbor? Agree with him to pick 12 of your other neighbors to adjudicate. If the neighbor doesna€™ 
t accept the judgment? Round up a posse
to deal with the situation using your unalienable rights to bear arms. Friedman never went there.

He had no problem with governments that declared and enforced property rights, that adjudicated 
contracts, that even, in certain specified situations, imposed extra taxes to counterbalance 
externalities or provided social insurance where transactions costs seemed to keep the requisite 
markets from existing. London Mayor Ken Livingstonea€™ s congestion tax on cars in central London 
is Friedmana€™ s idea. Friedmana€™ s negative
income tax is one of the parents of what is now Americaa€™ s largest anti-poverty program, the 
Earned Income Tax Credit. Perhaps, you could get Friedman to say, in a first-best world you 
wouldna€™ t need a negative income tax, because people would sign up when relatively young for 
their own wage-insurance pools. But he would call that a sterile argument, given where we are now. 
Moreover, a negative income tax would be
administratively cheap and effective, and it would remove the intrusive and offensive nanny-state 
over- regulation of the lives of the poor that the existing welfare system imposes. Few liberals 
today would disagree.

Most importantly, in Friedmana€™ s mind, the government has a very powerful and necessary role to 
play in keeping the monetary and banking system work- ing smoothly through proper control of the 
money supply. If there was always sufficient liquidity in the economya€’’enough, but not too 
mucha€”then you could trust the market system to do its job. If not, you got the Great Depression, 
or hyperinflation. Thus, it was Friedmana€™ s
belief that the government was required to undertake relatively narrow but crucially important 
strategic interventions in order to stabilize the macroeconomya€”to keep production, employment, 
and prices on an even keel.

In this, Friedman was in the same chapter, if not on the same page, as John Maynard Keynes, the 
economic giant of the previous generation whose doctrines and influence Friedman worked tirelessly 
to supplant. The Great Depression had convinced Keynes that central bankers alone could not rescue 
and stabilize the market economy. To Keynes, stronger and more drastic strategic interventions were 
needed to boost or curb demand directly.
Friedman and his coauthor Anna J. Schwartz argued in their Monetary History of the United States 
that this was a misreading of the lessons of the Great Depression, which in Friedmana€™ s view was 
caused by monetary mismanagement (or perhaps could have been rapidly alleviated by skillful 
monetary management). Over the course of 40 years, his position carried the day: Federal Reserve 
Chair Ben Bernanke holds Friedmana€™ s
view,   not Keynesa€™ s.

Nevertheless, Friedman was not an advocate of a fully automatic system, such as a gold standard. 
Under a gold standard it is possible for the money supply to collapse. If people start to fear that 
the banks to which they have entrusted their savings are shaky, they will go to the banks 
anda€’’under a gold standarda€” demand that the banks give them their money back and give it back 
in gold. But with each dollar in gold that depositors
withdraw, any banking system has to call in perhaps five or more dollarsa€™ worth of loans in order 
to raise cash to keep from being overwhelmed by demands for liquidity. Fear on the part of 
depositors leads to a drying-up of capital and liquidity for businesses, and ultimately to economic 
depression.

It is here that Friedman and Schwartz felt the Fed had made its key mistake during the Great 
Depression. The stock market crash of late 1929, the recession that had already begun that June, 
the existing agricultural depression, and other news that shook confidence in the banking system 
led depositors to withdraw money from their bank accounts. The calling-in on loans that followed 
led to a steep fall in the money supply, in the liquidity of
the economy. And the Federal Reserve stood by. It did nota€”as Friedman thought it should 
havea€”take every active step it could to keep the economy liquid. It did not furiously print 
currency. It did not frantically buy Treasury bonds for cash from all comers. Instead, it followed 
what it thought was a a€ceneutrala€D monetary policy. And it was this neutrality that, in 
Friedmana€™ s viewa€”and in Bernankea€™ s, as well as my
owna€”made the Great Depression so great. This is not exactly the same view as Keynes, but the 
differences are smaller than most people realize.

To be sure, Friedman always said that he favored a minimalist government, a a€oenight watchmana€D 
state onlya€”but a government nonetheless. Establish property rights. Enforce contracts. Prevent 
violence and theft. Defend the country. Keep the economy liquid by keeping the monetary aggregate 
M2 on a stable growth path. That, to him, was a minimalist government.

But the last of these sticks out like a sore thumb: What is so special about the banking industry 
that the government must respond to a fall in demand for its services (for that is what going to 
the bank to pull out your deposit in gold constitutes) by providing it with a huge, immediate 
subsidy (for that is what buying up banksa€™ Treasury bonds for cash at their normal valuation 
constitutes)?

And, if Friedmana€™ s detailed study of the banking sector led him to make an exception from 
laissez-faire for this industry, who is he to say that a similarly detailed study of other 
industries would lead to similar conclusions about useful deviations from laissez-faire? And we 
have not mentioned that the a€oenight watchmana€n state is itself a very powerful enterprise, able 
to make and enforce its own judgments about whoowns what
against not just against roving bandits, but local notables and even its own functionaries. 
Friedmana€™ s minimal state is not so minimal, after all.

Friedman felt that his ideal state was the right one, but someone who reaches a different 
formulation can still agree with him on many of the same first principles. Indeed, it is by 
following through on these tensions in Friedmana€™ s thought that I, at least, am able to feel the 
power of his arguments and yet retain my own uneasy combination of neoliberalism and social 
democracy.

This is not to say that Friedmana€™ s legacy is all positive. Indeed, One of his closest 
ideological fellow travelers, Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit, worried about 
Friedmana€™ s a€oedogmatic streak,a€D which took his a€oebelief in the superior efficiency of free 
markets to government as a means of resource allocationa€D as a€oean article of faith, and not...a 
hypothesis,a€D Posner claims that Friedman found the ability of
Scandinavian nations, particularly Sweden, to achieve and maintain very high levels of economic 
output despite very high rates of taxation almost to be a personal affront. And, in the long run, 
this faith crippled the intellectual movement of which he was the head. Sometimes government 
failures are greater than the market failures for which they purport to compensate. Sometimes they 
are not. We badly need a sophisticated, flexible, and
reality-based intellectual toolkit to analyze different cases. We do not have one, in part because 
Friedmana€™ s anti-government faith blocked his spear-carriers from helping to develop it.

But, perhaps more seriously, Friedman ducked the big questions regarding the relationship between 
economic freedom and political liberty, and he was completely incapable of seeing that political 
liberty is both a negative and a positive liberty: freedom from tyranny and oppression but also the 
freedom and power to decide on and accomplish our common purposes. These are the master ques- tions 
of history and moral philosophy, and for
all his brilliance and hard work, Friedman is of absolutely no help in answering them. As Posner 
says, Friedrich Hayeka€™ s Road to Serfdom a€oeflunks the test of accuracy of prediction ... [The] 
view that socialism of the sort that Britain embraced under the old Labour Party was incompatible 
with democracy [is] extreme and inaccurate,a€D Yet Friedman bought into that Hayekian view. And in 
so doing, he ultimately led his followers,
and tried to lead the rest of us, down a false path.
