What methods of corporate control have saved them from turning into smaller versions of the unproductive Soviet economy?</p><p>That our economy is populated by large corporations shapes how we live. Our social being cannot but be shaped by the one-third of our waking lives spent at work. Our politics would be very different without corporations both as sources of pressure an influence on politicians and as intermediaries serving the purposes of politicians. It should not be surprising that the continued existence and, indeed, economic dominance of large corporations is due to a number of different forces.

That is inevitable. What we do not know is how fast that US and European dominance will be whittled away…. US president Joe Biden has delayed his country’s relative decline. EU leaders, however, look set to accelerate theirs. Biden’s $1.9tn fiscal stimulus package, passed last week, may not be literally visible from space, but it is certainly of planetary scale. In the OECD’s March update to its forecasts, the organisation estimated that the US stimulus will add one whole percentage point to projected global growth. It more than doubled its 2021 growth forecast for the US itself, from 3.3 to 6.5 per cent. Biden’s own administration foresees US output returning to its potential three to four years faster because of the stimulus…&nbsp;LINK: &lt;<a href="https://amp.ft.com/content/20096b0a-8a94-453d-8788-c3b15dc1704c">https://amp.ft.com/content/20096b0a-8a94-453d-8788-c3b15dc1704c</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>2) <strong>Bates Gill</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Endorsing “Self-Reliance”, Beijing Raises the Geopolitical Stakes</em>: ‘The “dual circulation” strategy announced at the National People’s Congress… a framework first coined by Xi Jinping last year…. Greater reliance on China’s enormous internal market (“domestic circulation”) for growth and technological innovation, rather than on capital-intensive growth, low-value exports and imported technology which spurred the country’s economic success in the past. The other half of the strategy, “international circulation”, will double down on China’s long-standing effort known as “Made in China 2025” (MIC 2025)… to upgrade its manufacturing base through the integration of information technology to improve productivity, increase the indigenous content of higher-end technology products, reduce reliance on foreign inputs and become more self-sufficient technologically… position China as the leading source of critical technologies and industrial outputs of the future across the value chain—in design, manufacturing processes, technology and material inputs, and finished products—in high-priority sectors including next-generation information technology, robotics, aerospace, high-speed rail, green energy, biopharma and new materials…. The NPC is not a deliberative body, but rather a political pageant to formalise decisions already made by party higher-ups. As such, the announcements&nbsp;last week signal a profound rethinking in Beijing… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/endorsing-self-reliance-beijing-raises-geopolitical-stakes">https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/endorsing-self-reliance-beijing-raises-geopolitical-stakes</a>&gt;</p><p></p><p></p><div><hr></div><p>3) Boris Johnson has set his credibility on fire, and has no potential allies anywhere in the world for whatever he wants to do on international diplomacy or economic policy. But that’s probably fine with him, since he does not want to accomplish anything other than become Prime Minister:</p><p><strong>Philip Stephens</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Squandering Trust Is No Route to a ‘Global Britain’</em>: ’By seeking to renege on his Brexit commitments, Boris Johnson has made the UK an unreliable ally…. Middle-ranking and smaller states seek… sheltering behind alliances, coalitions of the like-minded and multilateral rules. A long-promised foreign, diplomatic and intelligence strategy soon to be unveiled by Boris Johnson’s government must start from this simple premise…. International networks rest on mutual trust. Nations, like individuals, abide by the rules to the extent that others also act in good faith. Unreliable partners do not get to act as conveners. Which renders all the more inexplicable Johnson’s efforts to renege on the Brexit agreement he signed with the EU. The government’s move to delay implementation of agreed new checks on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland recalls a threat last year to repudiate the customs arrangements designed to avoid a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland…. Such things are noticed. Witness the remarks of Brendan Boyle, a congressional ally of US president Joe Biden. This was the second time, Boyle told BBC television’s Newsnight, “that this UK government has signed up to an international agreement and then immediately decided to go back on what it agreed to”. The move carried “all sorts of ramifications”. One of which could be a serious falling out with Washington. Biden has signalled he expects Johnson fully to uphold the Irish protocol…&nbsp;LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10ec8895-c84f-479e-9fc7-9dde0706dca3">https://www.ft.com/content/10ec8895-c84f-479e-9fc7-9dde0706dca3</a>&gt;</p><p></p><div><hr></div><p>4) One of the major pedagogical and intellectual-presentational revolutions of our time:</p><p><strong>Matt Asay</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Jupyter Has Revolutionized Data Science, &amp; It Started with a Chance Meeting Between Two Students</em>: ‘If you want to do data science, you’re going to have to become familiar with Jupyter… best known for Jupyter Notebooks, a web application that allows data scientists to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. This proves to be a great way to extract data with code and collaborate…. It started with a friendship. Fernando Pérez and Brian Granger met the first day they started graduate school at University of Colorado Boulder. Years later in 2004, they discussed the idea of creating a web-based notebook interface for IPython, which Pérez had started in 2001. This became Jupyter, but even then, they had no idea how much of an impact it would have within academia and beyond…&nbsp;LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/jupyter-has-revolutionized-data-science-and-it-started-with-a-chance-meeting-between-two-students/">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/jupyter-has-revolutionized-data-science-and-it-started-with-a-chance-meeting-between-two-students/</a>&gt;</p><p></p><div><hr></div><p>5) <strong>Noah Smith</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Checking in on the Global South</em>: ‘To some, the idea of a Global South means that history is destiny—that the dead hand of colonialism, or the living hand of neocolonialism, is holding down the developing world. To others, it’s an expression of the idea that poor countries just don’t have what it takes to get rich. Either way, it’s a form of implicit defeatism—a belief that historical and/or cultural forces are stronger than economic forces. Southeast Asia hasn’t yet broken these ideas on the wheel of hard data, but it might not take much longer to do so. Bangladesh’s similar performance, meanwhile, suggests that South Asia might not be far behind…&nbsp;LINK: &lt;<a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/checking-in-on-the-global-south">https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/checking-in-on-the-global-south</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>6) A very, very nice talk—the intellectual grandchild of Ragnar Nurkse, by way of Nicola Gennaioli and Andrei Shleifer:</p><p><strong>Ivan Werning</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Taming a Minsky Cycle</em>&nbsp;<code>&lt;</code><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzfqTWJ4JhU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzfqTWJ4JhU</a><code>&gt;</code>:</p><div><hr></div><p>7) James Robinson is scared at the large-scale soft treason of Republican actual and wannabee office holders, but I do not think he is scared enough.</p><p>It is not at all clear to me that Trumpian populism has failed. Trump has failed. But neofascism remains a mighty powerful force. If James Robinson would talk to Trumpists, he would recognize that Trump did “deliver the goods”—they imagine that, before the coming of the plague, they were enjoying an unparalleled economic boom; and they are not mistaken to think that Trump delivered the hate he had promised against immigrants, against uppity Blacks who did not know and stay in what Trumpists continue to think is their proper place, and against rootless cosmopolites. The only problem is that the center of the electorate is not—or is not yet—Trumpian. And, for some reason, the knives that actors from James Comey to Dean Baquet used to stab Hillary Rodham Clinton in the back failed to hit Joe Biden’s back this time, for lots of reasons:</p><p><strong>James A. Robinson</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Why Trumpian Populism Failed</em>: ‘US democracy remains vulnerable… owing to many Americans’ lack of commitment to democratic institutions. While Trump worked to de-institutionalize America and enrich himself while in office, the Republican Party either sat on its hands or in some cases applauded…. At the end of the day, Trump’s “America First” was mostly posturing, because he couldn’t deliver real improvements in the lives of his base. All successful autocrats—like former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, postwar Argentine President Juan Perón, or current Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni—somehow “deliver the goods” for their core constituencies. Trump delivered, but only to the rich, by cutting taxes and regulations. His symbolic gestures won’t endure, and his “Make America Great Again” slogan is destined for burial at the back of millions of American closets.&nbsp;</p><p>Republicans would be wise to consider this. Instead, much of the party, both in Congress and at the state and local level, still clings to the false narrative of election fraud and support for the insurrectionists, or advances the notion that the storming of the Capitol&nbsp;was staged to undermine Trump. This is deeply concerning. Perón was able to rule as he did after World War II because increased presidential meddling&nbsp;in Argentina’s Supreme Court and political institutions had eroded these bodies over the previous 15 years. Most Americans do not want to go down this path, even if many of their elected political leaders do…&nbsp;LINK: &lt;https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-democratic-institutions-prevailed-over-trump-this-time-by-james-a-robinson-2021-03&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>8) Figuring out how to do antitrust in the age of the attention economy is really, really hard:</p><p><strong>Ben Thompson</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The FTC’s Google Documents, the Staff Memo, the Economists Memo</em>: ‘The fundamental premise of the Politico article, along with much of the antitrust chatter in Washington, misses the point: Google is dominant because consumers like it. That doesn’t mean the company didn’t act anticompetitively, or that we shouldn’t think seriously about acquisitions or contracts or advertising. Such thinking, though, has to start with a certain degree of humility about the fundamentally different nature of the Internet and how it is leading to these Aggregator-type outcomes.
