Frederick Douglass (1869): Our Composite Nationality. a€~I am especially to speak to you of the 
character and mission of the United States, with special reference to the question whether we are 
the better or the worse for being composed of different races of men. I propose to consider first, 
what we are, second, what we are likely to be, and, thirdly,
what we ought to bea€!

There was a time when even brave men might look fearfully at the destiny of the Republic. When our 
country was involved in a tangled network of contradictions; when vast and irreconcilable social 
forces fiercely disputed for ascendancy and controla€!But that day has happily passed away. The 
storm has been weathered, and portents are nearly all in
our favora€!

The real trouble with us was never our system or form of Government, or the principles underlying 
it; but the peculiar composition of our people, the relations existing between them and the 
compromising spirit, which controlled the ruling power of the country.
We have for a long time hesitated to adopt and may yet refuse to adopt, and carry out, the only 
principle which can solve that difficulty and give peace, strength and security to the Republic, 
and that is the principle of absolute equality.

We are a country of all extremes, ends and opposites; the most conspicuous example of composite 
nationality in the world. Our people defy all the ethnological and logical classifications. In 
races we range all the way from black to white, with intermediate shades which, as in the 
apocalyptic vision, no man can name a number.
In regard to creeds and faiths, the condition is no better, and no worse. Differences both as to 
race and to religion are evidently more likely to increase than to diminish.

We stand between the populous shores of two great oceans. Our land is capable of supporting 
one-fifth of all the globe. Here, labor is abundant and here labor is better remunerated than 
anywhere else. All moral, social and geographical causes, conspire to bring to us the peoples of 
all other over-populated countriesa€!

Before the relations of these two races [Black and white] are satisfactorily settled, and in spite 
of all opposition, a new race is making its appearance within our borders and claiming attention. 
It is estimated that not less than one hundred thousand Chinamen, are now within the limits of the 
United Statesa€!I believe that Chinese immigration on a large
scale will yet be our irrepressible facta€!The same mighty forces which have swept our shores the 
overflowing populations of Europe; which have reduced the people of Ireland three millions below 
its normal standard; will operate in a similar manner upon the hungry population of China and other 
parts of Asiaa€!

Assuming then that this immigration already has a foothold and will continue for many years to 
come, we have a new element in our national composition, which is likely to exercise a large 
influence upon the thought and the action of the whole nation.

The old question as to what shall be done with [the] negro will have to give place to the greater 
question, a€oewhat shall be done with the Mongoliana€Da€! Already has California assumed a bitterly 
unfriendly attitude toward the Chinamen. Already has she driven them from her altars of justice. 
Already has she stamped them as outcasts and handed
them over to popular contempt and vulgar jest. Already are they the constant victims of cruel 
harshness and brutal violence. Already have our Celtic brothers, never slow to execute the behests 
of popular prejudice against the weak and defenseless, recognized in the heads of these people, fit 
targets for their shilalahs. Already, too, are their associations
formed in avowed hostility to the Chinese.

In all this there is, of course, nothing strange. Repugnance to the presence and influence of 
foreigners is an ancient feeling among men. It is peculiar to no particular race or nation. It is 
met with not only in the conduct of one nation toward another, but in the conduct of the 
inhabitants of different parts of the same country, some times of the same city,
and even of the same villagea€!

For this feeling there are many apologies, for there was never yet an error, however flagrant and 
hurtful, for which some plausible defense could not be framed. Chattel slavery, king craft, priest 
craft, pious frauds, intolerance, persecution, suicide, assassination, repudiation, and a thousand 
other errors and crimes, have all had their defenses and
apologies.

Prejudice of race and color has been equally upheld. The two best arguments in its defense are, 
first, the worthlessness of the class against which it was directed; and, second, that the feeling 
itself is entirely natural.

The way to overcome the first argument is to work for the elevation of those deemed worthless, and 
thus make them worthy of regard and they will soon become worthy and not worthless. As to the 
natural argument it may be said that nature has many sides. Many things are in a certain sense 
natural, which are neither wise nor best. It is natural to walk,
but shall men therefore refuse to ride? It is natural to ride on horseback, shall men therefore 
refuse steam and rail? Civilization is itself a constant war upon some forces in nature; shall we 
therefore abandon civilization and go back to savage fife?

Nature has two voices, the one is high, the other low; one is in sweet accord with reason and 
justice, and the other apparently at war with both. The more men really know of the essential 
nature of things, and on of the true relation of mankind, the freer they are from prejudices of 
every kinda€!
Do you ask, if I favor such immigration, I answer I would. Would you have them naturalized, and 
have them invested with all the rights of American citizenship? I would. Would you allow them to 
vote? I would. Would you allow them to hold office? I would.

But are there not reasons against all this? Is there not such a law or principle as that of 
self-preservation? Does not every race owe something to itself? Should it not attend to the 
dictates of common sense? Should not a superior race protect itself from contact with inferior 
ones? Are not the white peoplethe owners of this continent? Have they not the
right to say, what kind of people shall be allowed to come here and settle? Is there not such a 
thing as being more generous than wise? In the effort to promote civilization may we not corrupt 
and destroy what we have? Is it best to take on board more passengers than the ship will carry?

To all of this and more I have one among many answers, together satisfactory to me, though I cannot 
promise that it will be so to you.
I submit that this question of Chinese immigration should be settled upon higher principles than 
those of a cold and selfish expediency.

There are such things in the world as human rights. They rest upon no conventional foundation, but 
are external, universal, and indestructible. Among these, is the right of locomotion; the right of 
migration; the right, which belongs to no particular race, but belongs alike to all and to all 
alike. It is the right you assert by staying here, and your fathers
asserted by coming here. It is this great right that I assert for the Chinese and Japanese, and for 
all other varieties of men equally with yourselves, now and forever. I know of no rights of race 
superior to the rights of humanity, and when there is a supposed conflict between human and 
national rights, it is safe to go to the side of humanity. I have great
respect for the blue eyed and light haired races of America. They are a mighty people. In any 
struggle for the good things of this world they need have no fear. They have no need to doubt that 
they will get their full share.

But I reject the arrogant and scornful theory by which they would limit migratory rights, or any 
other essential human rights to themselves, and which would make them the owners of this great 
continent to the exclusion of all other races of men.

I want a home here not only for the negro, the mulatto and the Latin races; but I want the Asiatic 
to find a home here in the United States, and feel at home here, both for his sake and for ours. 
Right wrongs no mana€!And here I hold that a liberal and brotherly welcome to all who are likely to 
come to the United States, is the only wise policy, which this
nation can adopt.

Preorder my Slouching Towards Utopia

It has been thoughtfully observed that every nation, owing to its peculiar character and 
composition, has a definite mission in the world. What that mission is, and what policy is best 
adapted to assist in its fulfillment, is the business of its people and its statesmen to know, and 
knowing, to make a noble use of said knowledge.

I need to stop here to name or describe the missions of other and more ancient nationalities. Ours 
seems plain and unmistakable. Our geographical position, our relation to the outside world, our 
fundamental principles of Government, world embracing in their scope and character, our vast 
resources, requiring all manner of labor to develop them, and our
already existing composite population, all conspire to one grand end, and that is to make us the 
perfect national illustration of the unit and dignity of the human family, that the world has ever 
seen.

In whatever else other nations may have been great and grand, our greatness and grandeur will be 
found in the faithful application of the principle of perfect civil equality to the people of all 
races and of all creeds, and to men of no creeds. We are not only bound to this position by our 
organic structure and by our revolutionary antecedents, but by the
genius of our people. Gathered here, from all quarters of the globe by a common aspiration for 
rational liberty as against caste, divine right Governments and privileged classes, it would be 
unwise to be found fighting against ourselves and among ourselves; it would be madness to set up 
any one race above another, or one religion above another, or
proscribe any on account of race color or creed.

The apprehension that we shall be swamped or swallowed up by Mongolian civilization; that the 
Caucasian race may not be able to hold their own against that vast incoming population, does not 
seem entitled to much respect. Though they come as the waves come, we shall be stronger if we 
receive them as friends and give them a reason for loving our
country and our institutionsa€[Contact with these yellow children of The Celestial Empire would 
convince us that the points of human difference, great as they, upon first sight, seem, are as 
nothing compared with the points of human agreement. Such contact would remove mountains of 
prejudiced!

The voice of civilization speaks an unmistakable language against the isolation of families, 
nations and races, and pleads for composite nationality as essential to her triumphs.

Those races of men, which have maintained the most separate and distinct existence for the longest 
periods of time; which have had the least intercourse with other races of men, are a standing 
confirmation of the folly of isolation. The very soil of the national mind becomes, in such cases, 
barren, and can only be resuscitated by assistance from without.

Look at England, whose mighty power is now felt, and for centuries has been felt, all around the 
world. It is worthy of special remark, that precisely those parts of that proud Island, which have 
received the largest and most diverse populations, are today, the parts most distinguished for 
industry, enterprise, invention and general enlightenment. In
Wales, and in the Highlands of Scotland, the boast is made of their pure blood and that they were 
never conquered, but no man can contemplate them without wishing they had been conquered.

They are far in the rear of every other part of the English realm in all the comforts and 
conveniences of life, as well as in mental and physical development. Neither law nor learning 
descends to us from the mountains of Wales or from the Highlands of Scotland. The ancient Briton 
whom Julius Caesar would not have a slave, is not to be compared with
the round, burly, a[m]plitudinous Englishman in many of the qualities of desirable manhood.

The theory that each race of men has come special faculty, some peculiar gift or quality of mind or 
heart, needed to the perfection and happiness of the whole is a broad and beneficent theory, and 
besides its beneficence, has in its support, the voice of experience. Nobody doubts this theory 
when applied to animals and plants, and no one can show that it
is not equally true when applied to races.

All great qualities are never found in any one man or in any one race. The whole of humanity, like 
the whole of everything else, is ever greater than a part. Men only know themselves by knowing 
others, and contact is essential to this knowledge. In one race we perceive the predominance of 
imagination; in another, like Chinese, we remark its total
absence. In one people, we have the reasoning faculty, in another, for music; in another, exists 
courage; in another, great physical vigor; and so on through the whole list of human qualities. All 
are needed to temper, modify, round and complete.

Not the least among the arguments whose consideration should dispose to welcome among us the 
peoples of all countries, nationalities and color, is the fact that all races and varieties of men 
are improvable. This is the grand distinguishing attribute of humanity and separates man from all 
other animals. If it could be shown that any particular race of
men are literally incapable of improvement, we might hesitate to welcome them here. But no such men 
are anywhere to be found, and if there were, it is not likely that they would ever trouble us with 
their presence.

The fact that the Chinese and other nations desire to come and do come, is a proof of their 
capacity for improvement and of their fitness to come.

We should take council of both nature and art in the consideration of this question. When the 
architect intends a grand structure, he makes the foundation broad and strong. We should imitate 
this prudence in laying the foundation of the future Republic. There is a law of harmony in 
departments of nature. The oak is in the acorn. The career and destiny
of individual men are enfolded in the elements of which they are composed. The same is true of a 
nation. It will be something or it will be nothing. It will be great, or it will be small, 
according to its own essential qualities. As these are rich and varied, or poor and simple, slender 
and feeble, broad and strong, so will be the life and destiny of the nation
itself.

The stream cannot rise higher than its source. The ship cannot sail faster than the wind. The 
flight of the arrow depends upon the strength and elasticity of the bow; and as with these, so with 
a nation.

The stream cannot rise higher than its source. The ship cannot sail faster than the wind. The 
flight of the arrow depends upon the strength and elasticity of the bow; and as with these, so with 
a nation.

If we would reach a degree of civilization higher and grander than any yet attained, we should 
welcome to our ample continent all nations, kindreds [sic] tongues and peoples; and as fast as they 
learn our language and comprehend the duties of citizenship, we should incorporate them into the 
American body politic. The outspread wings of the American
eagle are broad enough to shelter all who are likely to come.

As a matter of selfish policy, leaving right and humanity out of the question, we cannot wisely 
pursue any other course. Other Governments mainly depend for security upon the sword; our depends 
mainly upon the friendship of its people. In all matters a€” in time of peace, in time of war, and 
at all times a€” it makes its appeal to all the people, and to
all classes of the people. Its strength lies in their friendship and cheerful support in every time 
of need, and that policy is a mad one which would reduce the number of its friends by excluding 
those who would come, or by alienating those who are already here.

Our Republic is itself a strong argument in favor of composite nationality. It is no disparagement 
to Americans of English descent, to affirm that much of the wealth, leisure, culture, refinement 
and civilization of the country are due to the arm of the negro and the muscle of the Irishman. 
Without these and the wealth created by their sturdy toil, English
civilization had still lingered this side of the Alleghanies [sic], and the wolf still be howling 
on their summitsa€!

The grand right of migration and the great wisdom of incorporating foreign elements into our body 
politic, are founded not upon any genealogical or archeological theory, however learned, but upon 
the broad fact of a common human nature.
Man is man, the world over. This fact is affirmed and admitted in any effort to deny it. The 
sentiments we exhibit, whether love or hate, confidence or fear, respect or contempt, will always 
imply a like humanitya€!

Let the Chinaman come; he will help to augment the national wealth. He will help to develop our 
boundless resources; he will help to pay off our national debt. He will help to lighten the burden 
of national taxation. He will give us the benefit of his skill asa manufacturer and tiller of the 
soil, in which he isunsurpassed.

Even the matter of religious liberty, which has cost the world more tears, more blood and more 
agony, than any other interest, will be helped by his presence. I know of no church, however 
tolerant; of no priesthood, however enlightened, which could be safely trusted with the 
tremendouspower which universalconformity would confer. We should
welcome all men of every shade of religious opinion, as among the best means of checking the 
arrogance and intolerance which are the almost inevitable concomitants of general conformity. 
Religious liberty always flourishes best amid the clash and competition of rival religious 
creedsa€!

I close these remarks as I began. If our action shall be in accordance with the principles of 
justice, liberty, and perfect human equality, no eloquence can adequately portray the greatness and 
grandeur of the future of the Republic.
