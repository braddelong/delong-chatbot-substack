Neoliberalism has relied on deregulation, privatization, weakened trade unions, less progressive taxation, and new trade rules…. These shifts have resulted in widening inequality, diminished economic security, and reduced confidence in the ability of government to aid its citizens. The Republican embrace of this doctrine is hardly surprising… [but] the allure of neoliberalism to many Democrats is a puzzle worth exploring…. As a dissenting remnant of pre-Keynesian economics, neoliberalism languished until the New Deal model faltered in the 1970s with the improbable combination of inflation and stagnation…. Gerstle explains how the cultural left also found the libertarian and antibureaucratic aspects of neoliberalism appealing, weakening the New Deal order and its political coalition in yet another way…. Neoliberalism not only protects the market from the regulatory state; more radically, it expands market principles to realms thought to be partially social…. Was it a success or a failure? That depends on who you are. For economic elites and the Republican Party, it has been a splendid success. For the Democratic Party, the neoliberal order has been a catastrophe…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/07/21/free-markets-besieged-citizens-gerstle-kuttner/">https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/07/21/free-markets-besieged-citizens-gerstle-kuttner/</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Ken White &amp; Josh Barro</strong>: <em>Serious Trouble EP07</em>: ‘What they’ve done here in that agreement is say in advance in the contract that Elon Musk agrees… to allow specific performance… &lt;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I-iVbkJ9kH4uYHS_m4pu2f6cgE0EpVr6p8mrW0GI5uY/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I-iVbkJ9kH4uYHS_m4pu2f6cgE0EpVr6p8mrW0GI5uY/edit</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Kevin T.

I have the standard complaints that their emphases are not mine, but those are standard. The one perhaps-substantial bone I would pick is that I think that they have the hierarchical order of importance of the components of the Great Transformation reversed. For me, the biggest deal is the circa-1870 coming of Modern Economic Growth. The 1770-1870 British surge into the Industrial Revolution, while an essential prerequisite, was a smaller deal. The 1600-1770 “Little Divergence” rise of northwest Europe is a smaller deal even still, but even that is, I think, of much more importance than any 800-1600 “Great Divergence” between Europe and Asia. Caravels and gunpowder weapons turn out to be very important for political-imperial reasons, yes; but they are not the meat and fish of civilizational advance, were quickly transferable, and gunpowder empires across Eurasia as of 1600 look, to me at least, much of a piece:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Davis Kedrosky</strong>: <em>Book Review: How the World Became Rich</em>: ‘Mark Koyama and Jared Rubin &lt;<a href="https://www.howtheworldbecamerich.com/home">https://www.howtheworldbecamerich.com/home</a>&gt; have written what will almost certainly become a beloved economic history classic…. I put another book on pause to read it. As a manic completionist, I never do this, but once I had peeked past the blue-girded front cover I couldn’t put it down. Now I’ve read it twice. So it goes…. The first [part] is a literature review of the five main strands of… the New Historical Economics. The second is… a literature review… of… [the] “rise of the west”… and covers the medieval preconditions for European growth, Britain’s takeoff, and the spread of the Industrial Revolution to the global periphery…. Geography, institutions, culture, demography, and colonialism…. Geography… K&amp;R downplay these…. K&amp;R also take umbrage with the Wrigley-Pomeranz-Allen axis on the indispensability of coal to the Industrial Revolution…. K&amp;R are making a meta-argument resembling Robert Brenner (1976)’s explanation for why the impact of the fourteenth-century demographic crises differed to the east and west of the River Elbe…. We know the partial effects of lots of things in the abstract, but unless we control for context-specific characteristics…. Demography (e.g. the European Marriage Pattern) is treated similarly to geography; only in combination with institutional or cultural forces can beneficient changes in birth rates stimulate growth…. Institutions and culture… show up as universal solvents… limited government and the protection of property rights tend to be globally good, and sometimes decisive in the shift to sustained growth…. For a short work, the coverage is fantastic…. As befits a Jared Rubin book, the section on culture is also particularly weighty…. The authors have little patience for theories… according colonialism a decisive role in promoting Western economic growth. They argue that the negative effects of European expansion abroad came after the onset of the Great Divergence…. A theory of development is just what K&amp;R attempt in the book’s second half…. Europe’s Great Divergence… Northwest Europe’s Little Divergence… Britain’s surge…. Europe had two advantage… a landmass “fractured”… creating several “core” regions that could be dominated by separate polities; and… some distance from the steppe…. In the late-medieval city-states… the rent-seeking of municipal oligarchs and the “low technological base” of the period curtailed the efflorescence…. [In] the forward surge of the Anglo-Dutch commercial kingdoms… the emergence of limited government, specifically parliaments…. The situation becomes more complex when the authors have to explain Britain’s divergence from the Dutch. Why did Dutch institutions follow the medieval Italian city-states into rent-seeking and decay, but Britain establish a stable alliance between mercantile, industrial, and landed power under the aegis of a powerful parliamentary state?… We’re told that the Dutch also suffered from heavy war taxes, which is true—but Britain also boasted a fearsome and often regressive tax regime that funneled enormous sums into military spending…. Ultimately, K&amp;R take a reasonable tack. Many countries shared one or two advantages with Britain, but in hindsight, she appeared to have all of them…. On to the spread of development. K&amp;R favor human capital-based explanations for the Second Industrial Revolution…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:57964460,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://daviskedrosky.substack.com/p/book-review-how-the-world-became&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:29892,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Economic History Research&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5f6e817c-2c6f-4455-b329-08b210ed66fe_1064x1064.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Book Review: How the World Became Rich&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;In How the World Became Rich, Mark Koyama and Jared Rubin have written what will almost certainly become a beloved economic history classic, as Power and Plenty or The British Industrial Revolution in Global Perspective became over a decade ago.
