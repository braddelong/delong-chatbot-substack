No, we are not back to pre-plague levels. But we are certainly getting there. And a full recovery is certainly attainable: we could have another 7 million jobs over the next two years, if we are lucky and skillful:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ellen Ioanes</strong>: <em>Understand the News</em>: ‘The labor market added 678,000 jobs in February, driving the unemployment rate down to 3.8 percent from 4 percent in January, the lowest level since the start of the pandemic…. The strong employment numbers are a good sign for the labor market and reflect a rebound from the latest wave of Covid–19 infections due to the omicron variant — and post-pandemic recovery overall. But employment is not yet back to pre-pandemic levels, and many people need to negotiate child care and health concerns. The employment boom isn’t hitting everyone equally; the unemployment rate for Black women rose from 5.8 percent to 6.1 percent in February from the previous month. Their participation in the workforce also decreased by .2 percentage points last month. Nevertheless, the positive jobs numbers are part of the calculus that goes into the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates in an effort to combat inflation…. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that “hindsight says we should have moved earlier” on rate increases…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.vox.com/">https://www.vox.com/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>And let me disagree with Powell: I see no reason why the Fed should have “moved earlier” on rate increases. Bond-market expectations of medium- and long-term inflation are still extraordinarily well-anchored. And one of the major benefits of maintaining the anchor is that then it gives you policy flexibility to do whatever is optimal in the short run to attain maximum feasible employment and productivity growth.</p><p>That means that the Federal Reserve’s task is to craft a path for interest rates <em>and for the short-term inflation rate</em> that gets the economy to the place where a well-functioning frictionless flex-price macroeconomy would go if it could. We cannot have a frictionless flex-price macroeconomy. We have sticky prices. We have, for very powerful human psychological reasons, downward-sticky wages. We have sticky debts. (In the context of sticky debts, the standard 20th-century austerian belief that a business-cycle free macroeconomy could be attained in a straightforward way by a war to destroy labor unions appears more than usually silly.) The fact that we are repeatedly kissing up to and sticking to the zero-lower bound means that the nominal interest-rate degree-of=freedom is simply not enough to do the job.</p><p>Plus we do need for relative prices to move to provide the incentives for the structural sectoral adjustment that we need to undertake.</p><p>So why, again, should the Fed have moved earlier to hike interest rates? If medium- and long-term inflation expectations were on the move, I would get the point. But where is the evidence that they are?</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Picture:</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="blob:https://braddelong.substack.com/dc8a595d-b6e9-4e9d-a0af-47660bebaf8b"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="blob:https://braddelong.substack.com/dc8a595d-b6e9-4e9d-a0af-47660bebaf8b 424w, blob:https://braddelong.substack.com/dc8a595d-b6e9-4e9d-a0af-47660bebaf8b 848w, blob:https://braddelong.substack.com/dc8a595d-b6e9-4e9d-a0af-47660bebaf8b 1272w, blob:https://braddelong.substack.com/dc8a595d-b6e9-4e9d-a0af-47660bebaf8b 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="blob:https://braddelong.substack.com/dc8a595d-b6e9-4e9d-a0af-47660bebaf8b" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;blob:https://braddelong.substack.com/dc8a595d-b6e9-4e9d-a0af-47660bebaf8b&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;width&quot;:null,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="blob:https://braddelong.substack.com/dc8a595d-b6e9-4e9d-a0af-47660bebaf8b 424w, blob:https://braddelong.substack.com/dc8a595d-b6e9-4e9d-a0af-47660bebaf8b 848w, blob:https://braddelong.substack.com/dc8a595d-b6e9-4e9d-a0af-47660bebaf8b 1272w, blob:https://braddelong.substack.com/dc8a595d-b6e9-4e9d-a0af-47660bebaf8b 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Thomas Piketty</strong>: <em>On Economic Ideology</em>: ‘The best books on Historical Change and Economic Ideology…. <em>The Great Demarcation</em>… by Rafe Blaufarb. <em>Gold and Freedom</em>… by Nicolas Barreyre. <em>Citizenship between Empire and Nation</em>… by Frederick Cooper. <em>Castes of Mind</em>… by Nicholas B.

We relegate the gory details to the realm of parenting classes and raunchy comedy. But it’s absolutely real. We’ve eliminated many of our burdens through the magic of technology—carrying water all day, washing laundry by hand in the river, chopping firewood to heat our homes—but pregnancy remains. Unless you’re rich, of course. My wealthy friend, whose first pregnancy required a hysterectomy due to <em>placenta accreta</em>, will have her second child via a surrogate, using pre-frozen embryos. This costs upwards of $100,000, which is approximately equal to the entire median wealth of an American household. Who would begrudge my friend this? And even if she were able to bear a second child herself, who would begrudge her the opportunity to outsource it? Artificial wombs are simply a way to take a privilege for the upper class, and make it possible for other classes of society to enjoy it as well. And this is how it’ll almost certainly be received. Angry Twitter people always seem to envision new technologies as something that government imposes on the populace, possibly at the behest of mad billionaires.

It’s about what they can do to you without consequence and what you can’t do to them without consequence. The social contract is tyranny. They owe nothing to you. You, however, owe everything to them.&nbsp;They call themselves the “real Americans.” For everyone else, freedom is democracy and self-government. That requires respect for social contract, which itself requires respect for the truth, as the truth is independent from human agency. The truth not only binds equal citizens but enables compromise between them. At root is the recognition that the common interest and common good are achievable through shared purpose and sacrifice. We are all in this together. Only when we honor that can we all of us be truly free. In my view, these are the real Americans…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.editorialboard.com/the-real-americans-versus-the-real-americans/">https://www.editorialboard.com/the-real-americans-versus-the-real-americans/</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Jordan Schneider &amp; Chris Miller</strong>: <em>What Happens to China Now That Autocrats Are Bad News?</em>: ‘<strong>Jordan Schneider</strong>: “After Crimea [Russian foreign minister] Sergei Lavrov had this enormous shit-eating grin on his face. I don’t have the words for the contrast between this and what we saw at the Security Council meeting. They looked like they were staring death in the face…. What happened [on Sunday]. There was a lot of weirdness and not particularly coordinated messaging. What gives?” <strong>Chris Miller</strong>: “I think the Security Council meeting is the greatest puzzle of what we’ve seen over the past couple of weeks. Although it was publicly described as a live broadcast, if you zoom in on the watches in the meeting, it was prerecorded…. Every key member of the Russian political elite… every single one of them seemed a little bit uncertain about where things were going…. The technocrats and the government… seeming very nervous and unsure…. Putin laughed twice at [Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service] Sergei Naryshkin. It was almost as though the Kremlin wanted to show that the elite was being whipped into shape. But I’m surprised that Putin felt like the elite had to be whipped into shape….” <strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong> “It’s a weird dynamic when this is your team who you’ve had 20 years to pick. You’re about to go to war alongside them and then you dress them down in public and then you record it and then five hours or however long later you have the whole world watching, it’s just an odd series of events.” <strong>Chris Miller</strong>: "Before this week we’d been talking a little bit about Putin becoming more isolated during the pandemic… a very rigid regime of quarantine…. The pandemic does seem to have affected him on a personal level and cut off his access to information. I think this has impacted him in a way that we didn’t fully understand…. I can’t wait for Sergei Lavrov’s memoirs.
