Lisa D. Cook: Statement Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, & Urban Affairs, United States 
Senate: a€~Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and other members of the Committee, thank you 
very much for the opportunity to appear before you today.

I am humbled and honored to have been nominated by President Biden to be a member of the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I earned my Ph.D. at Berkeley, served on the Presidenta€™ 
s Council of Economic Advisers, and have spent decades teaching, studying, and researching economic 
growth and monetary policies. The depth and breadth of my experience in both the public and private 
sectors qualify me to serve as a Federal Reserve
Governor, and, should I be confirmed, I would be honored to work with my colleagues to help 
navigate this critical moment for our nationa€™ s economy and the global economy.

In terms of priorities, I agree with Chair Powell that our most important task is tackling 
inflation. High inflation is a grave threat to a long, sustained expansion, which we know raises 
the standard of living for all Americans and leads to broad-based, shared prosperity. That is why I 
am committed to keeping inflation expectations well anchored.

My approach to complex problems is to be guided by facts, data, and analysis and to work 
collaboratively. I have served in the Administrations of Presidents from both parties, and when I 
make decisions, I do so based on the facts and not politics. In this respect, I will follow the 
example of Paul Volcker, whom I greatly admire for his unwavering dedication to a nonpolitical and 
independent Federal Reserve.

My convictions were shaped by my upbringing in Milledgeville, Georgia. It was the desegregating 
South, and both sides of my family were promoting nonviolent change alongside our family friend, 
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. While my sisters, Pamela and Melanie, and I were integrating 
our schools and pools, my parents were integrating their places of work. My mother, Professor Mary 
Murray Cook, and my aunt, Professor Loretta Murray Braxton,
integrated their universities and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) 
departments by race and by gender, preparing students for a desegregating South that promised 
greater opportunity for all. My cousin Floyd McKissick, Sr., spoke at the March on Washington and 
integrated the University of North Carolina law school. My uncle, Dr. Samuel DuBois Cook, studied 
with Dr. King at Morehouse College, was the first African American
tenured professor at a southern university, and later was president of Dillard University. I want 
to thank Senators Warren, Kennedy, and Tillis, as well as the many other senators, who honored my 
uncle in a Senate resolution upon his death in 2017.

The sense of discipline, hope, and mission instilled in me by my family has taken me from Spelman 
College to Oxford, the Hoover Institution, and Harvard, but I have never forgotten where I came 
from and the dedicated teachers who supported me. I chose to seek my current tenured position as a 
macroeconomist in the industrial Midwest in this same spirit of being close to how our economic 
decisions affect working families. Living in a manufacturing hub
during the financial crisis has underscored the effect that deep recessions have on everyday lives. 
And that is one reason I have dedicated much of my career to preventing the next financial crisis. 
A strong and resilient financial system supports American families, businesses, and our economy.

My research on economic growth has been informed by my interactions with families, businesses, 
policymakers, and financial institutions. I have extensive experience working for many types of 
banks, including serving on the board of a community development financial institution, or CDFI, in 
Grand Rapids. I am particularly proud that community banks were among those that elected me to 
serve on the board of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. I
have also worked closely with the Federal Reserve over the course of my career, conducting research 
at Reserve Banks before and after receiving my doctorate, attending policy conferences, and serving 
on advisory panels and as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. There is still much to 
learn to make sure the Fed does its job even better. Our economy is constantly evolving. Learning 
to do better will require humility, perseverance, and diverse

Again, it is an honor to be considered for this position, and I look forward to working with 
members of this Committee. If confirmed, I will faithfully support the congressionally mandated 
goals of stable prices and maximum employment, which Congress has entrusted to the Federal Reserve.
Thank you. I look forward to your questions.
