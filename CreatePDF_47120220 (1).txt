Macroeconomics in a Nutshell

Our benchmark is a fully flex-price perfectly-competitive
economy:

•  Such a thing is (or should be) always at full employment

• Economists’ training:

1. Figure out how to get the economy to its perfectly-competitive equilibrium (we should all
agree that failing to do that—leaving $50 bills on the sidewalk—is not a good thing).

2. Then rationally and reasonably discuss social policy so that, in the long run, we get to the

best of the possible different perfectly-competitive equilibria (never mind that such
discussions always deadlock, and veto points lead to the status quo).

•  Economists note that we have sticky prices that keep us from getting always to full-

employment equilibrium (sticky wages, sticky prices, sticky debt contracts).

•  Business of the central bank (and fiscal authority): make Say’s Law true in practice even
though its is false in theory

• Interaction of macro, structural sectoral adjustment, and micro...

John Maynard Keynes (1919): The Economic Consequences of the Peace <https://archive .org/details/in 
.ernet .dli .2015.14117/page/n228/mode/1 up?view=theater&q=lenin>:

Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch 
the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and 
unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only 
confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily, and,
while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary 
rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the 
existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts 
and even beyond their expectations or desires,
become "profiteers,", who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism 
has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of 
the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and 
creditors, which form the ultimate
foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process 
of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.

Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of 
society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on 
the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to 
diagnose.

In the latter stages of the war all the belligerent governments practised, from necessity or 
incompetence, what a Bolshevist might have done from design. Even now, when the war is over, most 
of them continue out of weakness the same malpractices. But further, the Governments of Europe, 
being many of them at this moment
reckless in their methods as well as weak, seek to direct on to a class known as "profiteers" the 
popular indignation against the more obvious consequences of their vicious methods. These 
"profiteers" are, broadly speaking, the entrepreneur class of capitalists, that is to say, the 
active and constructive element in the whole
capitalist society, who in a period of rapidly rising prices cannot help but get rich quick whether 
they wish it or desire it or not. If prices are continually rising, every trader who has purchased 
for stock or owns property and plant inevitably makes profits.

By directing hatred against this class, therefore, the European Governments are carrying a step 
further the fatal process which the subtle mind of Lenin had consciously conceived. The profiteers 
are a consequence and not a cause of rising prices. By combining a popular hatred of the class of 
entrepreneurs with the blow already
given to social security by the violent and arbitrary disturbance of contract and of the 
established equilibrium of wealth which is the inevitable result of inflation, these Governments 
are fast rendering impossible a continuance of the social and economic order of the nineteenth 
century. But they have no plan for replacing ita€!
