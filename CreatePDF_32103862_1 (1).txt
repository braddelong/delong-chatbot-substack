Matt Yglesias: Vaccines Are Better than You Think'. a€~None of the people in the Pfizer/Moderna 
treatment groups died or even fell seriously ill and had to be hospitalizeda€!. These days they 
vaccinate kids against
chickenpox, so kids mostly dona€™ t get chicken pox. But even more remarkable, when they do get 
chickenpox these days ita€™ s a a€oesick for a few daysa€D kind of thing not a€oemiss weeks of 
school while suffering
in agony.a€D This is a really big deal with regard to the lower efficacy we are expecting from the 
AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. A vaccine thata€™ s only 70 percent effective at 
blocking infection would be
expected to generate a larger than that reduction in hospitalizations and an even larger reduction 
in deathsa€! LINK: chttps: ZZwww.slowboring.com/pZgood-vaccines>

James H. Williams & al.: Carbona€CJIeutral Pathways for the United States: a€~Modeling the entire 
U.S. energy and industrial systema€! we created multiple pathways to net zero and net negative CO2 
emissions by
2050. They met all forecast U.S. energy needs at a net cost of 0.2a€“l .2% of GDP in 2050, using 
only commercial or neara€□commercial technologies, and requiring no early retirement of existing 
infrastructure. Pathways
with constraints on consumer behavior, land use, biomass use, and technology choices (e.g., no 
nuclear) met the target but at higher cost. All pathways employed four basic strategies: energy 
efficiency, decarbonized
electricity, electrification, and carbon capture. Leasta€Dcost pathways were based on >80% wind and 
solar electricity plus thermal generation for reliabilitya€!.

In the next decade, the actions required in all pathways were similar: expand renewable capacity 
3.5 fold, retire coal, maintain existing gas generating capacity, and increase electric vehicle and 
heat pump sales to >50% of
market share. This study provides a playbook for carbon neutrality policy with concrete neara€Dterm 
prioritiesa€! LINK: <https ://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020AV000284>

that ita€™ s not just a pump and

GameStop investors will come at
the expense of later investors who will be left holding the bag when the stock fallsa€! LINK:

Noah Smith: About that TFP stagnationa€\: a€~Wow! If you look only at the durables sector, there 
was no Great Stagnation at alla€!. Durables TFP has been growing more strongly posta€“1993 than it 
ever did in the post-
WW2 boom! Consider this: In the 26 years from a€™47 to a€™ 73, durables TFP nearly doubled, but in 
the 15 years from a€™ 94-a€™ 09, durables TFP more than doubleda€!. Something big did happen to 
technological
progressa€! not in 1973a€! but a decade earlier. In the 15 years to 1963, the two sectors 
progressed pretty much in tandem. But sometime in the early- to mida€“60s, they diverged wildly, 
with nondurables [and services] TFP
rising anemically through the late 70s and then basically flatlining until nowa€!.

I think we should look at the a€oeGreat Stagnationa€D as a more subtle phenomenon than simply the 
exhaustion of the a€oelow-hanging fruita€D of nature. Our technologies for producing durable goods 
are improving
faster than evera€! LINK:

Matt Clancy: Maybe There is No Technological Slowdown: a€~Vollratha€™ s preferred decomposition of 
the causes of the 1.25% annual slowdown in real GDP per capita growth is: 0.80pp - Declining growth 
in human
capital; 0.20pp - The shift of spending from goods to services; 0.15pp - Declining reallocation of 
workers and firms; 0.1 Opp - Declining geographic mobilitya€!. Human capital alone accounts for 
two-thirds of the
slowdowna€!.

This leaves about 0.45pp left over for explanations related to the capital stock and TFP. Indeed, 
you can see in the graph above that GDP per capita growth drops noticeably in 2007, but TFP growth 
only drops a bit. Thus,
right off the bat, Vollrath argues a slowdown in technological progress explains at most part of 
one-third of the growth slowdowna€!.

Services involve the purchase of attention from someone: childcare workers, doctors, restaurant 
servers, and so on. To the extent you are paying for attention from someone, ita€™ s very hard to 
improve TFP. For these kind
of services, TFP growth would entail finding a way to get more minutes of attention out of the same 
number of workersa€!. Ita€™ s not clear where the extra attention can come froma€!
