FOCUS: On Re-Meeting bCourses, UC Berkeleya€™s CMS:

When I run into systems that get in my way relative to systems that I remember having decades agoa€l
What I want the webpage to look like:

Lecture Notes:

2022-01-26 Th: Malthusian Logic

Required Readings:

Clark: A Farewell to Alms chs. 2-5 <https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/files/8504Q117>

Optional Readings:

Brad DeLong: Lecture Notes: The Solow Growth Model: Malthusian Economies 
<http://datahub.berkeley.edu/user-redirect/interact?
account=braddelonq&repo=history-of-economic-growth-theory-readings&branch=main&path=heg-growth-theor
y.ipynb>|

In order to get this up onto Berkeleya€™ s bCourses websitea€’’which I am returning to after a fall 
sabbatical semestera€”I would prefer to use John Grubera€™ s wonderful Markdown 
<https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>, and type:

**Lecture Notes:**

> 2022-07-26 Th: Malthusian Logic

**Required Readings:**

> **Clark ; A Farewell to Alms chs. 2-5 <https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/files/85040117>

Optional Readings: *

> * Brad DeLong: **_Lecture Notes: The Solow Growth Model: Malthusian Economies_

<http://datahub.berkeley.edu/user-redirect/interact?account=braddelong&repo=history-
of-economic-growth-theory-readings&branch=main&path=heg-growth-theory.ipynb>

But I cana€™ t. So I type into bCoursesa€™ s WYSIWYG editor and punch some formatting buttons. 
bCourses produces an underlying html layer.
What I would consider a€ceacceptablea€D html:

<pxstrong> Lecture Notes: /strongx/p>

But this is the underlying html code that Berkeleya€™ s CMS wants to give me:

WHY, in the Holy Name of THE ONE WHO IS, WHY?

Yes, I understand that you are really not supposed to look at the html in a CMS. Yes. Still: BUT 
WHY!?

I just want plain-vanilla text, bold, italic, and <links> that behave in a default way. I have no 
need for things to be of the 'inline_disabled' class; for 'target' tags so that some links to open 
in the current and some links to open in a new tab/windowa€’’either one would be fine, if it were 
consistenta€”for a distinction between links that go into and links that go outside the CMS; for 
'data-api-endpoint', 'data-
api-returntype', and 'data-id's, all of which are implicit in the target url; for pointless 
'<emx/em>' and other null tags left in the html stream; and for pointless '<span>a€!</span>' tags. 
(I can approve of 'rel=a€Dnoopenera€LT; and I understand, and can forgive, the social-engineering 
nudges involved in the accessibility-score dial.)

It is more than purely Alsthetic.

At least once a day, when editing something in bCoursesa€™ s WYSIWYG editor, something goes wrong 
and I do have to drop into html to see (most recently, why shift-return has not generated a simple 
'<br />' but instead something really weird). I then have to undertake a five-minute de-crufting 
process before I can see what is going on. And so I am knocked out of my flow.
a€oeJohn Henry and the steamhammer!a€D you say? No! I love steamhammers! But the steamhammer should 
be a well-designed steamhammer, with proper affordances. It should be something like Markdown! It 
is Markdown! But if you search bCourses help for a€oemarkdowna€n:

Your search did not return any results: markdown

Yes, I should spring and pay $15 for Typora <https://typora.io> or some such, and write-and-paste.
Maybe this past week of semester-start and renewed contact with bCourses will induce me to do soa€!

And, meanwhile, elsewhere in infotech gone wrong: Chat-GPT tells me that right now I am best known 
as the author of Slouching Towards Utopia: The Economic History of the Twentieth Century and of The 
Fist of Contrition: A History of the Public Debt of the United States.

ONE AUDIO: How China Is Ruled:

<https://overcast.fm/+oiPVDTr-A>

Ezra Klein: a€~A lot is happening in China right nowa€!. Yuen Yuen Ang is a professor of political 
economy, a China scholar at Johns Hopkins University and the author of a€oeChinaa€™ s Gilded Age: 
The Paradox of Economic Boom and Vast Corruption.a€D Her basic argument isa€! you need to first 
understand ChinaaC™ s unique, often misunderstood political systema€!
a€oeautocracy with democratic characteristics.a€D Because we in the West are so fixated on how 
China selects its leaders, she argues, wea€™ ve overlooked a more subtle but far more consequential 
revolution in how China is governed. That transformation of the Chinese political system is the 
deeper story behind both the countrya€™ s economic success a€” as well as its current
troubles.

Very Briefly Noted:

•  Noah Smith: Fiscal arsonists: a€~We didna€™ t go very far down the slippery slope to this sort 
of disaster in 2011.... But that doesna€™ t mean that what the Tea Party Congress did was OK. It 
took us one step down the slippery slope toward catastrophe, and thata€™ s one step too many. 
Americans were not happy.  The GOPa€™ s debt ceiling brinksmanship might have been a factor in Mitt

Romneya€™ s defeat in 2012...

•  Tara Palmieri: Feeling the Vern: a€~Vern Buchanan exploded after losing Ways & Means to a 
McCarthy ally, fueling anxiety that he could retire out of piquea€”and that McCarthya€™ s favor 
trading has eroded his narrow margin of supporta€!

•  Jason Smith: Genuine a€oeLongtermisma€D: a€~A genuine longtermist wouldna€™ t be racist. 
Genotype diversity is species survival, not special preferences for specific phenotypesa€! social 
welfare policies so that every human can live and support a familya€! redistribute the wealth of 
billionairesa€! basically be a social democrata€!

• Eric Hoel: Why I am not an effective altruist: a€~The origins of the effective altruist movement 
in utilitarianism means that as definitions get more specific it becomes clear that within lurks a 
poison, and the choice of all effective altruists is either to dilute that poison, and therefore 
dilute their philosophy, or swallow the poison whole. This poisona€! is not a quirk, or a bug, but 
rather a feature of
utilitarian philosophy, and can be found in even the smallest dropa€!

•  Robert B. Hubbell: A press release beneath the dignity of the Court: a€~a€~The one thing that 
the press release does not say is that the Marshal interviewed the justices as part of the 
investigation. Instead, we are told that the Marshal a€cespokea€D to the justices as part of an 
a€oeiterative processa€D in which they a€oeasked and answered questionsa€D...

•  Paul Krugman: a€~Many people think inflation is still running wild; the big deceleration in the 
2nd half of 2022 hasn't broken through to public consciousnessa€!. Traditional core inflation still 
reflecting rent increases from a year ago. And asymmetric reporting: breathless coverage of rising 
inflation, disinflation not so mucha€!

AJs:

Martin Wolf: In defence of democratic capitalism: a€~The marriage of liberal economics and 
democracy has brought immense benefits to the world, but faces its toughest test in decades. What 
needs to be done? The energy behind populism cannot be ignored, let alone suppressed. It needs to 
be harnessed, instead. Politicians committed to liberal democracy must respond to the widespread 
distrust of elites
not by surrendering to them, but by making themselves trustworthy, once again. This is what 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt achieved in the 1930s, by combining the innovative ideas and competence 
of people such as Frances Perkins, the labour secretary who laid the foundation of the US social 
security system, with barnstorming rhetoric against what he called a€oegovernment by organised 
moneya€D.
Successful renewal is possible now, tooa€!. It is impossible to sustain a universal suffrage 
democracy with a market economy if the former does not appear open to the influence a€” and the 
latter does not serve the interestsa€”of the people at large. This, in turn, demands a political 
response rooted not in thedestructive politics of identity, but of welfare for  all citizensa€”that 
is,a commitment to economic
opportunity and basic security for all. Building on FDR himself, domestic policy goals should be 
rising, widely shared and sustainable standards of living, good jobs for those who can work, 
equality of opportunity, security for those who need it and ending a€oespecial privilegesa€D for 
the fewa€!

Can Duruk: Google vs. ChatGPT told by aglio e olio: a€~The real reason Google is at risk that 
thanks to their monopoly position, the folks over at Mountain View have left their once-incredible 
search experience degenerate into a spam-ridden, SEO-fueled hellscapea€!. The fact that many people 
are  comparingOpenATs tech demo to Google's flagship product should be causing     alarmbells togo 
off
long time, Google's claim to fame was to getting the users the answers they want faster than the 
competition. That doesn't hold true for many types of queries anymore. More than half the time, I 
have to add 'site:redditcom' to get anything that is not SEO spama€!
