This shift from (a) ideas spreading primarily because they are useful to an upper class élite running a force-and-fraud domination-and-exploitation scheme on the rest of society, to (b) ideas spreading because they are true of empirical reality.</p></li><li><p>Nate Rosenberg and David Mowery would say that it was the diffusion of the steam engine that created a critical mass of engineers in the first two-thirds of the 1800s that was the key, and that once you had that critical mass the development f the industrial research lab was inevitable. Alfred DuPont Chandler would say similar things about the railroad: you had to build a corporation as we know it to run a railroad, and, once done, the advantages of diffusing that organizational form to other technology-frontier industries would become obvious.</p></li><li><p>Others would find different causally-thin critical nexuses:</p><ul><li><p>The consequences of the British-Dutch naval victories in the Wars of the League of Augsburg and of the Spanish Succession.</p></li><li><p>The Glorious Revolution of 1688.</p></li><li><p>Emperor Heinrich IV Salier, reportedly standing in the snow outside of the castle at Canossa in 1077, and the establishment there and then of the principle that the law is not just a tool for but binds even the most powerful.</p></li><li><p>Or you might even go back to the emergence of a strict monotheism—a God focused not on this world but on heaven and hell—in which case in this world one should praise the Lord, yes, but what is important here and now is to pass the ammunition.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>I wish I had a good answer. But already this year both Mark Koyama and Jared Rubin and Oded Galor have put in their own bids on these issues, set forth their own excellent analyses:</p><p>Most social energy back then was devoted to the elite's (a) running a force-and-fraud, exploitation-and-domination machine, (b) elbowing other potential elites out of the way, and then (c) utilizing their ill-gotten gains in building a high culture in which the non-elite were villains and churns.</p><p>After 1870, technological progress took off like a rocket. It rapidly became clear that there was a good chance that humanity would soon, in historical timescales, gain the technological powers to bake a sufficiently large economic pie that everybody could have enough.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, having baked a sufficiently large, Economic pie, all humanity would have to do is solve the second order problems of slicing the pie, and then tasting the pie – utilizing our soon-to-be-immense collective wealth to enable people to flourish, to live lives that were safe, secure, healthy, and happy.&nbsp;</p><p>Before 1870, the road to anything one might claim as even a semi-utopia was closed. After 1870, the road was open.</p><p>What is that? You say that 1712 and the invention of the steam engine, not 1870, is the hinge of history? Maybe you are right. But I think you're probably not. Globally, economic growth from 1770 to 1870, in the century of the steam engine, was insufficient for humanity to gain more than a few steps in the race between technological invention and Malthusian fertility. Over 1770 to 1860, only perhaps 1/3 of growth comes from technological progress proper. The second third comes from concentrating the industry of the world in the place where manufacturing production is most efficient. The last third comes from the natural resource bonanza of extremely cheap coal because the last glaciers scraped off all the rock that had covered it. But the extremely cheap cold was close to gone by 1870. And you can only globalize and gain the efficiency benefits from concentrating manufacturing once.&nbsp;</p><p>Absent the technological-acceleration sea-change in 1870, I claim that the most likely counterfactual would be for growth to slow after 1870 and humanity to remain under the Malthusian harrow in a a Steampunk World.</p><p>But, for the purpose of my book, this is a side issue. We can debate 1712 or 1870 until the cows come home. Indeed, economic historians will debate it as long as the human species lasts--and perhaps longer. My book wants to look forward from 1870, not backward at the earlier 1800s, the 1700s, and the times before.</p><p>while the U.S. was “the furnace where the future was being forged” my probably excessive focus on it as in some sense the leading point-guard of humanity’s slouch towards utopia harmed the book. A greater share of my points could and should have been made by drawing examples from elsewhere in the global north rather than falling-back on the U.S. examples with which I am most comfortable.</p><p>while we have made extraordinary progress at figuring out how to bake a sufficiently large economic pie so that, potentially, everyone can have&nbsp;<em><strong>enough</strong></em>, the problems of slicing and tasting that economic pie have completely flummoxed us. Thus while we are rich and powerful beyond the wildest dreams of avarice of previous centuries, that is all. We can neither equitably distribute our wealth nor properly utilize it to live wisely and well, so that people feel safe and secure, and live lives in which they are healthy and happy. To say “have not been distributed particularly evenly” and “our desires have grown” catches only half of it. Distribution has not been inept, but has been positively poisonous. And utilization has fallen vastly short not just because of our rising expectations: people 200 years ago would also have hoped along with us for a world in which they were not stalked by flying killer robots, and in which sinister people in steel and glass towers did not attempt to hypnotize them via dopamine loops to glue their eyes to screens in terror so they could be sold fake diabetes cures and crypto grifts.</p><p>When it comes to Matt’s criticisms [8] through [10], however, I do want to push back: I really think that the Grand Narrative of the Long 20th Century is success at baking and failure at slicing and tasting a sufficiently large econoic pie, and that while we do not know what the Grand Narrative of the era that started sometime after 2000 will be, it will be something different. I do see fossil-fuel emissions-generated global warming as a huge challenge not so much because of technocratic and geoengineering concerns but because of political economy concerns—and I note, in support of that belief, that Matt Klein cannot bring himself to say “global warming”, let along “fossil-fuel emissions-generated global warming”. As for the causes of the Great Depression, I see the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve as mediator-causes in the Friedman-Schwartz story, and debt as an accelerant of an ongoing process rather than as a spark.</p><p>We humans are an anthology intelligence both with respect to knowledge and information and with respect to work and production. Put the one side are we manage ourselves in the realm of thought. How do we manage ourselves in the realm of work and production? Or, rather, how does each of us try to tune our by-now extremely sophisticated and fine division of labor so that we can accomplish our own purposes?</p><p>Well, basically, there are three ways that we can appropriate for ourselves things out of the common pool created by our extremely sophisticated division of labor in production and work. We can do so by force, by fraud, or by win-win exchange. Which of those we choose is determined by how much we regard ourselves as invested in the well-being of others, how much effort each of these modes of action is for us, and how valuable is the work of those whose efforts we are trying to control and appropriate. When something becomes or when someone’s work becomes more valuable, it is worth more of our energy to appropriate—and this can either be good or bad for those who make all the valuable things, depending:</p><blockquote><p>[11] Delong has a throwaway comment that the slowdown in productivity growth (as opposed to total growth) since 1970 could be explained in part by the fact that “energy diverted away from producing more and into producing cleaner would quickly show up in lower wage increases and profits” (431). I’m not sure I buy this but I would have appreciated more of an explanation either way...</p><p>[12] Finally, I would have liked more on this (453): “It is normal for a plutocratic elite, once formed, to use its political power to shape the economy to its own advantages. And it is normal for this to put a drag on economic growth. Rapid growth like that which occurred between 1945 and 1973, after all, requires creative destruction; and, because it is the plutocrats’ wealth that is being destroyed, they are unlikely to encourage it.” A different version of the book would have used this to frame a long discussion of antitrust and public choice theory. More generally, I would love to know the extent to which the post-1870 boom was due to the suppression of this “normal” behavior. If so, what caused that? And how can we restore the dynamism and competition that Schumpeter recognized was so essential for progress?…</p></blockquote><p>1/ How do you define progress?</p><p><strong>Three elements:</strong></p><p><strong>First, getting out from under the hammer of necessity, which for most of human history has been the Harrow of Malthus: A world in which you see half your babies die, your life expectancy is 25, you go to bed hungry lots of the time, and much of your planning has to be simply, "How do I keep this biological machine going for one day?" Progress is getting away from that: acquiring power to manipulate nature, and power to successfully, and politely, and peacefully organize humans to actually get things done. Progress is power to escape from the kingdom of necessity, and enter the kingdom of freedom.</strong></p><p><strong>Second, progress has to be relatively egalitarian. An élite of thugs with spears assisted by tame accountants, propagandists, and bureaucrats running a force-and-fraud exploitation-extraction-and-domination grift régime does not become “progress” when you add laser weapons to it. Ming the Merciless, Emperor of Mongo, is not what we are looking for.</strong></p><p><strong>And third, there's the question of actually using your power to manipulate nature and figure out how to organize ourselves, so we can actually have a sophisticated functioning, hence highly productive division of the labor, figuring out what we then want to do, in order that we live lives is worth living.</strong></p><p>2/ What are the essential elements required for progress to happen?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technological power—plus what humans want in terms of reward and respect, so that we can organize ourselves in what Charlie from Trier said the goal was: “a free society of associated producers”. People not only need to have material stuff and social powers to achieve their purposes, they also need to feel that they are respected, and even more they need to feel that they're making a contribution. Those three elements have to be built on top of technological competence and excellence. As for the utilization of technological power, you have got to say: "Let 100 flowers bloom." Progress will be when people can thoughtfully let their best selves choose what the goals they wish to accomplish in their lives are</strong></p><p>3/ What would a “progress agenda” look like? What changes are required in how we approach our most significant problems?</p><p><strong>Much more attention to the downsides of technology. Winston Churchill, writing after World War I, looking backward, noted how the people like him who had marveled at all the technological inventions of 1870 to 1914 had not fully realized what that meant for how destructive war would be. And Churchill had been First Lord of the Admiralty: the person in charge of procuring the guns with the 15-inch barrels that throw multi-ton shells 15 miles where they then go boom. Where our technology is taking us, and how we need to form it in such a way that it empowers people rather than bureaucracies and the... I don't want to say remnants, but the functioning force-and-fraud exploitation, extraction, and domination machine, the thugs with spears with their tame accountants, propagandists, and bureaucrats. Stewart Brand's&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Whole Earth Catalog</strong></em><strong>, Steve Jobs and company's 1984 Macintosh commercial. Technology in the service of the individual human mind, rather than technology in terms of the inhuman systems that dominate us all.</strong></p><p>4/ What do you see as some of the most significant barriers to progress right now?</p><p><strong>We are jumped-up East African Plains Apes, with brains arely competent to figure out where we left the keys in the morning. To ask us to think deeply and well about how to organize an 8 billion-node anthology intelligence for collective progress and human betterment, is well beyond us. The barriers are our fear and contempt, for when we get ourselves in a good place and recognize that we might well have been the people on the other side of the globe who have big problems then we can pull out an enormous altruistic, charitable effort to help people far away who we never knew and never will know. We have been growing this moral sense for quite a long time. It is a very good sense to grow.</strong></p><p>5/ What are the easiest opportunities for progress in your opinion? What are the areas in which a few critical interventions or changes could unlock a disproportionate amount of progress?</p><p><strong>The government should be funding a lot more research and development. Michael Kremer's ideas about big prizes for actually accomplishing missions. The market is a very nice mercenary institution in its place. But there is absolutely no way that it can generate the right kind and right amount of science and technological development. Science is an absolutely wonderful fiduciary institution, as Michael Polanyi would have put it, but it generates knowledge that's relatively abstract: the kinds of knowledge that a person or a team can discover,and then get enormous reputation credit for. There's this space in the middle of developing useful technologies and figuring how to apply them. It requires the public spirit and the enthusiasm about deploying and disseminating it of the scientist, but also the focus on the bottom line and “let's make this actually work cheaply at scale" that the market-driven corporation can achieve. So we really need something in the middle: something that marries the Cathedral and the Bazaar.</strong></p><p>6/ And conversely, what do you see as the most important places we need to make progress (even if it’s going to be more difficult)?</p><p><strong>We have managed to successfully transfer public health technology all around the glob. Pretty much everyone's life expectancy at birth now is 70 or more, But the world is still extraordinarily, astonishingly unequa: there are still 500 million of our brothers and sisters who live at less than $3 a day in real terms. And, even in the United States, greater San Francisco is four times as rich as rural Mississippi.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Figuring out how to do for the ability to productively contribute to the global division of social labor what we figured out how to do in spreading public health technologies around the world successfully—that is job one. Job two is to push ahead the technological frontier. And, of course, then there are jobs three and jobs four: keep nuclear weapons from blowing us up, and keep global warming from cooking the planet, probably by causing someone to use nuclear weapons.</strong></p><p><strong>The fact that the monsoon is 200 miles south of where it ought to be this year, with consequences that are not fun—that is not a canary in the coal mine. It's a giant awk that's screeching at maximum volume.</strong></p><p>7/ People seem to be more pessimistic about the potential for progress moving forward than they have been in the past. Do you think that’s true and if so, why?</p><p><strong>No. There are now 8 billion of us. We're better educated than before. We can better communicate than before. We have been a successful anthology intelligence since we learned to speak at various scales. At bigger scale we should be more poweful and competent.</strong></p><p><strong>One argument is that we've finally reached the scale beyond which the anthology intelligence that is the human group can function, that our global anthology intelligence human mind is going insane. And if humanity is best thought of as a global anthology intelligence, it is a very, very loosely wrapped one. It is not tightly wrapped at all.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>But communication is on our side. It is much harder now for fights among friends and neighbors to end in deadly violence, than it is if you were say, in the Highlands of Scotland where you rarely see strangers, in which case it's very easy to divide people into clan members to be helped and assisted, clan enemies to be killed, and strangers to be simply robbed. It ought to be harder and harder to do this. It ought to require more and more effort on the part of those who are performing the ethno-nationalist grift: "I'm going to get some kind of power by persuading you that people who look slightly different than you, who live in a slightly different place than you, or who, God forbid, want to major in lesbian dance therapy, are your enemies, and you need me to figure out how you can efficiently and effectively kill them, or at least keep them down."&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>That is becoming a harder and harder thing to do as communication becomes better and better. But that'sjust a hope.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The arc of the universe does not tend in any direction at all, except possibly to heat death followed by random Boltzmann brains due to quantum fluctuations.</strong></p><p>9/ How can we work to ensure that progress benefits everyone?</p><p><strong>Adopt the hard utilitarian mindset: The greatest good of the greatest number, with a strong recognition of how fast the marginal utility of wealth declines. Trust in human agency—in technologies that get people the information and then ask them to take action, as opposed to technologies to force people to do what some planner at the top has decided. We need gardeners and fertilizers, not bosses and commanders. That is where we're trying to guide our technologies. Authoritarian state surveillance capitalism, no matter how many utopian and egalitarian aspirations it has, is probably not the right place to go.</strong></p><p>10 / Are you optimistic about the future?</p><p><strong>As I person, I am generally happy. I don't know whether I'm optimistic. When people ask me if I am, I reach either for Gramsci or for Camus. Even if you have pessimism of the intellect, you aren't going to get anything done if you do not have optimism of the wil. Depression is a biological mechanism to make you move little while you heal. That's not the right response to anything today. Camus’s line is: "We must imagine Sisyphus happy.” That is deliberately ambiguous. Is it the logic of the situation that compells us, when we consider it fully, to realize that it is impossible for a rational being to think that Sisyphus is anything but happ?. Or is it that if we do not think Sisyphus is happy then we cannot live, and so we go kill ourself today. That ambiguity is an important thing to register.</strong></p><p>Before 1870, there was no possibility that the economic pie could be big&nbsp;<em><strong>enough</strong></em>. Slow technological progress, the necessity under patriarchy of trying to have more sons in the hope that at least one would survive, and natural resource scarcity—those put mankind under the Malthusian harrow, in dire poverty. Most social energy back then was devoted to the elite's (a) running a force-and-fraud, exploitation-and-domination machine, (b) elbowing other potential elites out of the way, and then (c) utilizing their ill-gotten gains in building a high culture in which the non-élite were villains and churns.</p><p>After 1870, technological progress took off like a rocket. It rapidly became clear that there was a good chance that humanity would soon, in historical timescales, gain the technological powers to bake a sufficiently large economic pie that everybody could have enough.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, having baked a sufficiently large economic pie, all humanity would have to do is solve the second order problems of slicing the pie, and then tasting the pie – utilizing our soon-to-be-immense collective wealth to enable people to flourish, to live lives that were safe, secure, healthy, and happy.&nbsp;</p><p>Before 1870, the road to anything one might claim as even a semi-utopia was closed. After 1870, the road was open.</p><p>We can see this if we make the heroic leaps of (a) trusting our estimates of human productivity levels and living standards in the past, and (b) identifying the level of technology—the value of the stock of useful ideas about manipulating nature and organizing humans deployed in and diffused throughout the world economy—as proportional to average real income times the square root of population.</p><p>Then we see that back before 1500 it was a very good century in which technology improved by more than 5%&nbsp;<em><strong>in a century</strong></em>—and, no, the march upward was not as an increasing pace. Over the 1500-1770 Imperial-Commercial era the rate of technology growth jumped up to 15%/century: the Columbian Exchange, the rest of full globalization, and a historically unique tinkering-inventing culture at the western edge of Eurasia playing about equal roles in the acceleration. Over the 1770-1870 Industrial-Revolution century deployed-and-diffused technology grew by 55%, with the benefits of concentrating the entire manufacturing of the globe in the region most productive, a unique engineering-inventing culture in the 300-mile radius circle around Dover, England, and the very lucky fact that the last glaciers had given us access to mines better than gold mines: mines of unbelievably cheap and accessible coal.</p><p>But you can only concentrate global manufacturing once. And you can only mine the near-surface coal once.</p><p>And even at the boosted 1770-1870 pace, growth did not get humanity out from under the Malthusian harrow. It was in the 1870s that John Stuart Mill published the last edition of his _Principles of Political Economy_, and he was then still claiming:</p><blockquote><p>Hitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day’s toil of any human being. They have enabled a greater population to live the same life of drudgery and imprisonment, and an increased number of manufacturers and others to make fortunes…</p></blockquote><p>After 1870, however, the economy went into gear: a 2.1%/year technology growth rate; a 33-year doubling time. Previously unimaginable economic growth revolutionized human life over and over, generation by generation, in not just one episode of Schumpeterian creative destruction but in repeated, never-ceasing episodes.</p><p>The problem of baking a sufficiently large economic pie so that everyone could, potentially, have _**enough**_ became visible. Accomplishing that seemed straightforward: let science rip to discovery, let engineering too rip to develop the fruits of science, and then let the market economy rip to deploy and diffuse the technologies of human benefit. And the market economy could do this, for if market prices are properly aligned are properly aligned with social values, the market economy is a magnificent crowdsourcing machine for humanity to use to solve the problems that it can be set. And the market can be set the problem of applying technology to produce wealth.</p><p>As of now, we have long since achieved what previous centuries would have seen as a solution to the problem of baking a sufficiently large economic pie to serve as the foundation for a proper utopia.</p><p>But somehow our utopia is not here.&nbsp;</p><p>After 1870 the problem of baking a big-enough pie was on track to being solved. And then? The problems of slicing and tasting the pie were seen by our predecessors as second-order problems, or barely problems at all. With potentially _**enough**_, there is no reason to maintain the force-and-fraud exploitation-and-domination machine that élites before 1870 had used to slice the pie to their benefit. And the problem of tasting—utilizing our technological powers to live life wisely and well, to empower human flourishing to produce safety, security, health, and happiness—should not be beyond the powers of a humanity that can invent AC power and the microprocessor, should it.</p><p>What went wrong? What happened.</p><p>This, I think, my book has nailed. Letting the market economy rip to solve the problem of making enough had consequences. The repeated, sequential, Schumpeterian creative-destruction economic revolutions meant that all was solid melted into air—all established patterns and orders were steamed away. Again and again. Men (and women) did have to try to build new institutions to manage the problems and opportunities of production, distribution, and utilization that the onrushing technological cornucopia brought.</p><p>But, as Friedrich Engels—this was Engels more than Marx—all of the rest of society must grow out of and be compatible with the technological base that is the shape of the forces of production. Revolutionizing technology every generation meant that the societal software running on the forces-of-production hardware needed to be rewritten on the fly as well. What had worked a generation ago, as for as socio-economo-political order was concerned, would not work now. What was cobbled together to fit the situation now would be buggy and crash in less than a generation. That was what post-1870 meant. And that was a new dynamic pattern for human history.</p><p>But there was more. The market economy had to be unleashed to apply technology to wealth creation. But the market economy produces wealth. It does not produce anything that society would regard as just.</p><p>Friedrich von Hayek—the genius who most clearly saw the value of the market economy for crowdsourcing—warned us not ask for social justice. Attempting to achieve it would undermine the market economy’s ability to do what it could do, and put us on, well, The Road to Serfdom. “The market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the market” had to be our only gospel.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as the genius Karl Polanyi put it, people will not stand for being told "blessed be the name of the market" that there are no rights but property rights, and Friedrich von Hayek is their prophet. People instead insist that “the market was made for man, not man for the market”. People saw themselves as deserving communities, incomes, and stability. They needed their Polanyian rights—to economic security, to an income level proportional to what they deserved, that other people should have income levels proportional to what they deserved too, in a connected society that gave them respect and place—plus that you should have some&nbsp; power in society even if you had no wealth. Trying to bring about the stark utopia of market society would thus be overwhelmed by social-political movements seeking social justice—and society might think that what was just could turn disastrous: :Hitler got substantial buy-in to his version, involving the extermination Jews and the demographic replacement of the population of Eastern Europe by ethnic Germans.</p><p>And, off in the corner, we have John Maynard Keynes whimpering: if only governments allowed his technocratic students to conduct a sensible monetary policy, along with a "somewhat comprehensive" socialization of investment, everyone would have a job in a tight labor market that gave some social power to the working class, technology plus compound interest would wreak marvels, rock-bottom interest rates would "euthanize" rentiers—they could only exert social power only at the cost of spending down their capital—and so humanity would solve the problems of production and distribution, leaving humanity to grapple with its real problem: that of utilization of our wealth to create a truly human world.</p><p>If we had time, we could go through the generations, the modes-of-production, the political-economy orders. But let me just say that it was was within these parameters—von Hayekian, Polanyian, Keynesian—that people frantically tried to rewrite society's socio-economic running code on the fly to cope with the technological changes in the underlying forces-of-production hardware.</p><p>Perhaps humanity, did indeed come close to an institutional-societal setup to tackle the problems of slicing and tasting. Post-WWII "social democracy" in the rich countries was a good try. Keynesian focus on full employment (and low interest rates to make amortizing the WWII-era debt easy), Beveridgian equality-through-redistribution (and public provision), plus a little Pigovian externality-compensation produced the Thirty Glorious Years.&nbsp;</p><p>But somehow social democracy failed its sustainability test, and was replaced by neoliberalism, which stubbornly persists in spite of its failure to fulfill any of its promises except that it would make the rich much richer with much more social power. Society may not know what "social justice" is, but it knows that it manifestly does not consist of giving benefits to and making life easy for those it assesses as "undeserving".</p><p>And so the wheel turned. Here we are. Why are not the good people of the global north happier and more satisfied with the techno-utopian marvels that have been delivered to them? Why has great wealth in historical perspective produced not reduced but increased economic anxiety? And how does that economic anxiety get transformed into ethno-nationalist fear and rage?&nbsp;</p><p>How is it that the neoliberal ordering of society still survives? In the global north, at least, it has not fulfilled its promise of restoring golden-age growth rates, or dismantling rent-seeking interests, or restoring society's moral center, or achieving a pro-producer form of social justice. In fact, it accomplished exactly none of the promises made by its original salesmen, save for making the rich richer and society more economically unequal. And yet it hung on.</p><p>Our current situation: in the rich countries there is enough by any reasonable standard, and yet we are all unhappy, all earnestly seeking to discover who the enemies are who have somehow stolen our rich birthright and fed us unappetizing lentil stew instead.</p><p>What do we do next? The answer to this question my book simply punts. That is for a younger generation than my failed one to decide. Global warming. Ethno-national terrorism on all scales from the individual AR-15 to the Combined Arms Army. Nuclear proliferation. Revived fascism. Technokleptocracy.

And also: no.</p><p>I did not intend to ignore that mode of "society" at all—hence the quotation marks around “moral”. A political movement’s view of what “social justice” is can be something that is very unjust, and usually (almost always, by our lights?) is. The Polanyian-rights reaction against the market—against the catallaxy’s insistence that the only rights that count are property rights—can take forms that are: reactionary, socialist, authoritarian, social democratic, fascist, fundamentalist, nationalist, militarist, democratic, cultist, and probably more; moreover, such movements can often be captured or partially captured by those whose social power is based on the catallaxy’s past rewards to them gained by luck, force, and fraud.</p><p>Do remember: Jake Soll’s &lt;<a href="https://t.co/VRln7S91JZ">https://t.co/VRln7S91JZ</a>&gt; book begins with Aristotle, Cato, &amp; Cicero scared of and trying to grapple with the consequences of the mercantile catallaxy that they see disrupting the social justiice of the city-state of the oligarchic republic via its elevation of those devoted to&nbsp;<em><strong>chrematistike</strong></em>&nbsp;over the proper wielders of social power</p><p>One big difference between Jake’s book and mine is that the period he covers—well, my index of the value of the stock of human technology deployed-and-diffused in the world economy stands at:</p><ul><li><p>0.2 in -300 (“ancient mode of production”, as Freddie from Barmen would say),&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>0.4 in 1400 (“late feudal”), and&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>0.8 in 1800 (“late gunpowder-empire”). It then stands at:</p></li><li><p>1.6 in 1895 (“late steampower/early 2nd Industrial Revolution”),&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>3.2 in 1935 (“mass production”),&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>6.4 in 1970 (“mass consumption”),&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>12.8 in 2000 (“global value chain”),&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>and now we are moving into the “info-biotech” economy.</p></li></ul><p>It is not just one movement from status to contract and one grappling with the form and requirements of modernity. It is repeated technological revolutions that change how we live and, indeed, who we are. But it took 1700 years to go from ancient to feudal, 400 from feudal to late gunpowder-empire, but only 100 to go to late-steampower, and then 35 each for mass production, mass consumption, global value-chain, and on into the future. And with each transformation of the mode-of-production trhe von Hayek-Polanyi tension takes a different form, and requires new ways of… not of “resolving”, but rather of “papering it over”.</p><p>Because the changes in the forces-of-production hardware since 1870 have been so fast and so furious, the chances of being able to land on a rough cobbled-together running socio-econo-political software code to create a stable society are rather low. This is in contrast to what happened before, in the times that Soll’s book covers, when there was a lot of time to repurpose, old furniture, construct new, and in general adjust the relations-of-production (and -communication, and -domination) software to the forces-of-production hardware.</p><p>No, this does not mean that back before 1870 things were in any sense at all "better". They were perhaps more stable, in the sense that the structure of society was rarely abandoned. But there was lots of a differnet form of instability, in the sense of different potential élite factions spending nearly all of their attention and their energy elbowing each other out of the way.</p><p>And, of course, back before 1870 the principal end toward which societal energy was directed was not advancing knowledge and deploying technology to uncover “the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible”. It was, rather, running the force and fraud mechanism by which the elite grabbed&nbsp;<em><strong>enough</strong></em>&nbsp;for its members and their families, since there was no prospect of there being&nbsp;<em><strong>enough</strong></em>&nbsp;for all.</p><p>Suppose that you are willing to accept my heroic assumption that “technology” is proportional to average real income per capita times the square-root of population, and suppose that you are willing to accept our guesses about past population and my hard-Malthusian view of 1500 and before...<br><br>Then you do indeed get an Axial Age -1000 to 150 technology proportional growth rate of 6% per century; a Late-Antiquity Pause 150 to 800 growth rate of 1.4% per century; and then a Mediæval 800 to 1500 growth rate of 5% per century:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95528c6c-906d-4287-b2d5-d99fdba988c4_1200x807.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95528c6c-906d-4287-b2d5-d99fdba988c4_1200x807.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95528c6c-906d-4287-b2d5-d99fdba988c4_1200x807.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95528c6c-906d-4287-b2d5-d99fdba988c4_1200x807.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95528c6c-906d-4287-b2d5-d99fdba988c4_1200x807.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/95528c6c-906d-4287-b2d5-d99fdba988c4_1200x807.jpeg" width="1200" height="807" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/95528c6c-906d-4287-b2d5-d99fdba988c4_1200x807.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:807,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95528c6c-906d-4287-b2d5-d99fdba988c4_1200x807.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95528c6c-906d-4287-b2d5-d99fdba988c4_1200x807.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95528c6c-906d-4287-b2d5-d99fdba988c4_1200x807.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95528c6c-906d-4287-b2d5-d99fdba988c4_1200x807.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>And it is pretty clear why. The aims of the élites who direct humanity’s energies are devoted to maintaining the force-and-fraud exploitation-extraction-&amp;-domination machine that they—the thugs-with-spears, their bosses, and their tame accountants, bureaucrats, and propagandists—run on the rest of humanity as the only way that élite members can have&nbsp;<em><strong>enough</strong></em>&nbsp;for themselves and their families. Ideas are judged primarily not by whether they are true or productive but by whether they reinforce the force-and-fraud machine. There is progress—coinage in -600, after which you can construct a division-of-labor with more than your friends, neighbors, and relatives without having to go through the kings and priests—the moldboard plow, double-cropping rice, the merino sheep, and so forth. But it is slow as social energies are directed elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>And the 150 to 800 Late Antiquity Pause should make you doubt whether there was any arc of history making for an increasing technology growth rate.<br><br>Then with 1500 comes the Imperial-Commercial Revolution Age, and the rate of technology growth triples to 15% per century. As I see it:</p><ul><li><p>1/3 of this is simply Mediæval (but now Gunpowder-Empire) business as usual,&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>1/3 of this is the Columbian Exchange and such, and&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>1/3 of this is a historically unique tinkering-inventing-recombining culture (Patrick Wyman’s book “The Verge” is, I think, very good on this) at the western edge of Eurasia.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Is this a sea-change in thought and society? Maybe. But the builder of the Antikythera Device, the inventor of coinage, and that guy Ish-baal who thought up the idea of using a stylized picture of an ox to stand for a particular phoneme way back in the year -1000 might say you nay.<br><br>Then from 1770-1870 we get the Industrial Revolution Century: an additional tripling of the technology growth rate worldwide from 0.15% to 0.44% per century. Again I divide this into thirds:</p><ul><li><p>1/3 from the globalization benefits of concentrating the entire manufacturing of the globe in the region most productive,&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>1/3 the very lucky fact that the last glaciers scraping off the post-Permian rock had given us access to mines of unbelievably cheap and accessible coal—stored sunlight of an unbelievable concentration and ease of use once you had unlocked its secret—and&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>1/3 to a unique engineering-inventing culture in the 300-mile radius circle around Dover, England (plus offshoots).&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The first two of these three tranches seem to me to have been overwhelmingly likely to have been transient.&nbsp;</p><p>And so, had technological progress continued after 1870 at 1/3 of the 1770-1870 rate—at 0.15%/year—humanity would still have been under the Malthusian harrow, with typical living standards constant at the rate that supported population growth of 0.3%/year—8% per generation—and no demographic transition.&nbsp;</p><p>Call this Permanent Steampunk World.&nbsp;</p><p>2010 would then see the technologies of 1890 or so, but with a much larger and hence much poorer human population than in actual 1890.<br><br>Would that world have been “modern”?&nbsp;</p><p>It would have had its Marx and its Freud. It would know relativity and quantum mechanics. But we are talking a typical world standard of living of $4 a day—not quite World Bank “dire poverty”, but damned close.<br><br>But this no-Industrial Research Lab to rationalize and routinize discovery and development, and no Modern Corporations to rationalize and routinize development and deployment of the Second Industrial Revolution technologies—does this make sense?<br><br>Quite possibly not. Nate Rosenberg and David Mowery would say you could not have the market economy of 1850 and the engineering profession and machine tool industry as they then stood and not go on to develop the IRL and the MC. And then the economy of 1850 was immanent in the society created by the early steam engine. And so on back to 1070 and the Investiture Crisis, which establishes the principle that law is more than the servant of the powerful but binds even the most powerful. And possibly back before 1070 as well: you can find anticipations of the shift from&nbsp;<em>gemeinschaft&nbsp;</em>to G<em>esellschaft,&nbsp;</em>rational inquiry into the operation of the world, and so on however far back you look, if you try hard enough.</p><p>I blush. I think both of the paragraphs I have constructed from excerpts from his review are correct.</p><p>We are well on the way to solving the problem of baking, a sufficiently large economic pie to create the potential for everybody to have&nbsp;<em><strong>enough</strong></em>. But as far as solving the problems of slicing, and tasting the pie—equitably distributing it, and utilizing our enormous technological wealth to empower all of us to live, lives in which we are safe and secure and healthy and happy—we are nowheresville. That would have surprised (most of) our predecessors: solving the problem of scarcity was thought to be the big problem. Once that was solved, governance would no longer have to take the form of an élite elbowing competing potential élites out of the way and running a force-and-fraud wealth-extraction con on humanity. Governance could take the form of writing economy-social software for human interactions to run on top of the technology-driven forces-of-production hardware, and that software-writing exercise ought to have been—was seen by utopians as inevitably being—straightforward.</p><p>Why do the problems of slicing and tasting the economic pie continue to flummox us when we have made so much progress at solving the problem of baking a sufficiently large pie? This I think the book has nailed. And I have already given enough overview thumbnails on this weblog to have become tired of repeating myself.</p><p>So let me just say that the overview is all very well, but there is a great deal to be learned by telling the stories of the individual failures to slice and taste—to equitably distribute and properly utilize our immense and increasing technology-driven wealth. And to get my selection from these stories, please buy and read the book: &lt;<a href="http://bit.ly/3pP3Krk">bit.ly/3pP3Krk</a>&gt;!</p><h3>2. Since 1980: The Rising Inequality Surprise</h3><p>The second part of this talk is how my self of 40 years ago that I talked about before—my twenty-year-old self—would be very surprised to find his elder self here, talking about inequality as a first-order problem for human society.</p><p>That twenty-year-old self confidently expected his lifetime to see a great narrowing of income and productivity differentials across nations. Roadblocks formed by imperialism and colonialism—external to a country and internal—by distance, and by blinkered ideologies had greatly widened income and productivity differentials since 1800. But those historical forces were passing away. Global development was on the agenda. And the profits to be made from raising productivity worldwide to Global North standards were so great that every exertion would be made to make it happen.</p><p>But, of course, that convergence has not happened.</p><p>Looking across nations, the world today is about as unequal as it was when I was born in 1960, albeit somewhat less unequal than at the moment of peak international income and productivity inequality in 1975.</p><p>Moreover, that twenty-year-old self confidently expected income and status differentials inside America to fall, not rise, over his lifetime. Racism and patriarchy seemed to be in retreat, and the underlying framework of social democracy—the New Deal Order, as historian Gary Gerstle likes to call it—gave us on the one hand full employment and rapidly increasing investment in education which gave market power and productivity to labor, and on the other the social-insurance state and progressive taxation which significantly leveled pre-fisc inequality and disrupted plutocratic dynastic accumulation. The dominant political-economic understanding of how this New Deal Order had come about had been most compactly set out by the great Simon Kuznets, with his heuristic of the “Kuznets Curve”. As my teacher Jeffrey Williamson summarized it in his Yale Kuznets lectures:</p><ul><li><p>As an agrarian economy industrializes, inequality rises simply because the modern-industrial sector pulls away from the traditional-agrarian one.</p></li><li><p>More important, however, is that, at least in the early stages of industrialization, technological progress is labor-saving—makes capital a substitute for rather than a complement to labor—and so boosts returns to capital while lowering returns to labor.</p></li><li><p>Moreover, a largely agrarian poor class, not yet through the demographic transition cannot afford the human-capital investments in their children needed to rescue the next generation from poverty.</p></li><li><p>And last comes the substantial amplification of wealth disparities from the rewards to market position in increasing-returns and high fixed-costs industries.</p></li></ul><p>The consequence? As industrialization takes place, income and wealth inequality rise, very substantially, producing a Gilded Age that the rich of later generations see as a Belle Époque.</p><p>All of these factors, however, are reversed in the later stages of industrialization. After the demographic transition is completed, resources to invest in human capital are ample. Rural-urban wealth gulfs are steamed away by the market. Technological progress becomes more labor-complementing than labor-substituting. Easier technological diffusion makes first-mover advantages of less important. Plus there is more: even an oligarchic political society can believe in antitrust to curb its plutocracy; and, most important, literate working class can organize and flex its political muscles for first political democracy, and then social democracy—steeply progressive taxes and an ample social insurance state</p><p>Simon Kuznets thus envisioned, and the near-consensus back when I was 20 or so agreed, that post-WWII social democracy—the New Deal Order—was very much a Fukuyama-like “end of history”. Yes, there were historical survivals from a worse past: the economic consequences of racism, sexism, past wealth dynasties and the transmission of wealth inequality. But those were all ebbing away. Robber barons were replaced by corporate techno structures. Political democracy made wealth, the servant of rather than the master of society.</p><p>Once again, it did not happen.</p><p>Or, rather, it happened—and then, with 1980, came the Neoliberal Turn. It turned out that social democracy —the New Deal Order—was in no sense an “end of history”. The future after 1980 did not see increasing equality of opportunity that continued to reduce inequality of result. Instead, we entered into the Second Gilded Age, in which we are now enmeshed. . And that is the end of the second part. The takeaways? The failure of post-colonial convergence, and the Neoliberal Turn of the early 1980s and the consequent coming of our Second Gilded Age, were great surprises to the supposed wise of previous generations.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>3. Why the Neoliberal Turn?</h3><p>And now I get to my third part: Why? Why the Neoliberal Turn?</p><p>Let me start this third part by focusing down, and dropping international income and wealth, disparities from my subject. They are probably the most important part of global inequality from the perspective of the human race as a whole. But I have limited time and limited knowledge. So let me focus on the reasons for the coming of the Neoliberal Turn, and our consequent Second Gilded Age.</p><p>Let us first go back to the days of 150 and more years ago—the years when humanity was ensorcelled by the Devil of Malthus. Slow productivity growth ,poverty, and the patriarchal requirement that one have surviving sons if one were to have social power—those all meant that population pressed upon the limits of subsistence. There was simply no way that humanity could possibly bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have enough.</p><p>What was one then to do, if one wanted&nbsp;<em><strong>enough</strong></em>&nbsp;for oneself and one’s family?</p><p>The answer was straightforward: one strained every nerve and muscle to become part of an élite. That élite would then elbow other potential élites out of the way. It would then run a force-and-fraud domination-and-exploitation game on humanity, so that it could grab&nbsp;<em><strong>enough</strong></em>&nbsp;for itself. Thus politics and governance were, primarily, how that élite—thugs with spears, and later with gunpowder weapons, assisted by their tame accountants, bureaucrats and propagandists—ran this domination-and-exploitation game, using of the resources they extracted to maintain their dominance, and some to build and enjoy their high culture.</p><p>Come 1870, however, the spell of Malthus began to lift. Worldwide, technological progress over 1770 to 1870 had been three times as rapid as over 1500 to 1770, which in turn had been three times as rapid as in the previous Agrarian-Mediæval years. But even 1770–1870 had not yet been fast enough to trigger the infant-mortality decline and the demographic transition to low fertility, and hence the ability to invest in a mass education on a large scale. After 1870, however, the global rate of technological progress more than quadrupled to something like our current 2% per year. Better nutrition, followed by a growing ability and growing knowledge to make public health investments—those started to push infant mortality on the way down. The population explosion could not keep up with technological advance. Slowly and unevenly, the fertility decline began, and, haltingly and unevenly, real income growth began to accelerate.</p><p>Within a generation after 1870, it became apparent that humanity had found what John Maynard Keynes was to call “Economic El Dorado”. It became apparent that it would not be that many more generations before humanity could bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have&nbsp;<em><strong>enough</strong></em>. And then, after that, what would be the point of the domination-and-exploitation machine run by the elite? Maintaining it was expensive. Why not have a free society of associated producers in which people rotated through the needed administrative tasks? It was not that anyone especially “deserved” more. The true source, after all, of rapidly growing human wealth was not the sweat of those currently doing the work. It was, rather the treasures of technological knowledge that all had inherited from our predecessors.</p><p>One answer was that “soon” was not “now”, and that the domination-and-exploitation machine needed to be kept going in order to power the engine of research and development, capital accumulation, and economic growth. As John Maynard Keynes, fully flying his upper-class twit freak flag, put it in 1919. Let me read out a long passage:</p><blockquote><p>Precisely the inequality of the distribution of wealth… made possible those vast accumulations of fixed wealth and of capital improvements which distinguished that age from all others…. The immense accumulations of fixed capital which, to the great benefit of mankind, were built up during the half century before the war, could never have come about in a Society where wealth was divided equitably…. This remarkable system depended… on a double bluff or deception…. The laboring classes… from ignorance or powerlessness… compelled, persuaded, or cajoled by custom, convention, authority, and the well-established order of Society into accepting, a situation in which they could call their own very little of the cake…. The capitalist classes… theoretically free to consume it, on the tacit underlying condition that they consumed very little of it in practice…. There grew round the non-consumption of the cake all those instincts of puritanism…. Saving was for old age or for your children; but this was only in theory,—the virtue of the cake was that it was never to be consumed, neither by you nor by your children after you…. Society knew what it was about. The cake was really very small in proportion to the appetites of consumption…. If only the cake were not cut but was allowed to grow… a day might come when there would at last be enough… and men… could proceed to the nobler exercises of their faculties…. But these thoughts lead too far from my present purpose. I seek only to point out that the principle of accumulation based on inequality was a vital part of the pre-war order of Society and of progress as we then understood it, and to emphasize that this principle depended on unstable psychological conditions, which it may be impossible to recreate…</p></blockquote><p>In short, for Keynes in 1919 the maintenance of Edwardian class structures and Gilded Age-levels of wealth and income inequality was essential for the progress of human race. And the restoration and shoring up of the Belle Époque order of economic and social inequality was the principal task of post-WWI reconstruction. And in 1930 he stressed the point:</p><blockquote><p>For at least another hundred years we must pretend to ourselves and to every one that fair is foul and foul is fair; for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still. For only they can lead us out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight…</p></blockquote><p>It has not quite been 100 years since 1930. But it has been 103 since 1919.</p><p>I cannot resist digressing to note that six years later Keynes had changed his tune. Under pressure from the Great Depression and the threats to liberal society then emanating from Moscow and Berlin, in 1936 he wrote about how:</p><blockquote><p>The outstanding faults of the economic society in which we live are its failure to provide for full employment and its arbitrary and inequitable distribution of wealth and incomes…</p></blockquote><p>Full employment was to be attained by letting Keynes’s technocratic students run a low interest-rate monetary policy supplemented by a “somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment” to match investment effort to desired savings at full employment.</p><p>But wealth and income inequality? A low interest-rate policy, Keynes hoped, would lead to the&nbsp;<em><strong>euthanasia of the rentier</strong></em>: plutocrats would find themselves only able to exercise the social power banked up in their wealth by spending-down their capital, and so ceasing to be plutocrats.</p><p>However, do not go too far toward full equality!:</p><blockquote><p>There is social and psychological justification for significant inequalities of incomes and wealth, but not for such large disparities as exist today…. It is better that a man should tyrannise over his bank balance than over his fellow-citizens… It may still be wise and prudent statesmanship to allow the game to be played… so long as the average man, or even a significant section of the community, is in fact strongly addicted to the money-making passion…</p></blockquote><p>But also:</p><blockquote><p>It is not necessary… that the game should be played for such high stakes as at present. Much lower stakes will serve the purpose equally well, as soon as the players are accustomed to them….</p></blockquote><p>In my&nbsp;<em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em>&nbsp;book I speak of the post-WWII global-north social democracy that Simon Kuznets thought of as the end-state of the inequality story as: the shotgun marriage of Friedrich von Hayek’s insights into the market as a social device for crowdsourcing solutions to human problems with Karl Polanyi’s insights into the refusal of humanity to accept any order in which the only rights that count are property rights and only the rich have social power and voice, blessed by John Maynard Keynes. I think that gets his final position as… presiding minister?… Father-in-law?… of social democracy broadly right.</p><p>This was, as I said in part 2, supposed to be “The End of History”: political democracy in tandem with social democracy, as the surviving remnants of plutocracy, patriarchy, and racism died away.</p><p>So why then the Neoliberal Turn?</p><p>To put it broadly, there are three theories.</p><p>The first is “unlucky accident”—you hear this, I suppose, most often from Paul Krugman. It was the inflation of the 1970s that destabilized belief in the New Deal Order, and the Neoliberals—those who believed that the rich needed to be made richer so that they focused their energies on being job creators rather than evaders of punitive taxes, who believed that the non-rich needed to be made poorer to incentivize them to cease being slackers and moochers, and that the market did things for good reasons, meaning that whatever income distribution the market generated was there for good reason which people should not dispute—who then picked up the pieces.</p><p>The second is Thomas Piketty’s theory. In broad and oversimplified strokes, it is that tenor of politics is largely determined by the concentration of wealth, and that even when the political power of potential plutocrats is at a low ebb they still have sufficient influence to maintain the typical rate of profit at 5% per year. Thus take 5% per year. Subtract from that the proportion of wealth that potential plutocrats consume, give away, and are taxed. Subtract from that the rate at which the labor force plus non-rich real incomes grow. If the answer is greater than zero, plutocratic wealth is becoming a larger share relative to the economy and a Gilded Age is on the way.</p><p>In Piketty’s view, Gilded Ages are the rule, and social democracy is the exception. We transitioned from social democracy to our Second Gilded Age in the global north as population growth fell and immigration restrictions lowered the rate of growth of the labor force, as the end of catch-up growth and productivity slowdowns reduced the rate of non-rich income increase, and as left-wing parties took their eyes off the ball and became “Brahmin”: focused on demonstrating that they took a proper moral attitude toward injustices rather than focused on lunch-pail income issues.</p><p>The Neoliberals themselves had a mish-mash of reasons as to why the Neoliberal Turn made sense:</p><ul><li><p>Make inequality greater to re-incentivize both the rich job creators and also the non-rich potential slackers and the moochers.</p></li><li><p>Social democracy was hopelessly corrupted by rent-seeking.</p></li><li><p>Social democracy was vastly over-bureaucratized.</p></li><li><p>Market means were better at attaining&nbsp;<em><strong>worthwhile</strong></em>&nbsp;social-democratic ends.</p></li><li><p>In fact, the market has a wisdom and a logic of its own, and if it produces inequality, it must be doing so for a reason.</p></li><li><p>The coming of information technology allows for a much more flexible, pro-freedom mode of social organization.</p></li><li><p>Social democracy is insulting: it gives you good things by virtue of your status as a citizen, when what you need is the opportunity to&nbsp;<em><strong>earn</strong></em>&nbsp;good things.</p></li></ul><p>Let me briefly comment on the last of these. There is a great clip of American actor Craig T. Nelson saying:</p><blockquote><p>I’ve been on food stamps and welfare. Did anybody help me out? No!…</p></blockquote><p>There is a logic under there. Food stamps and welfare are not “help”. Why not? Because they force him to trade his self-respect for food and shelter. They make him one-down, a moocher, in the great reciprocal gift-exchange network that is society. And Craig does not want to be a moocher—does not want to be the guy who always takes and never reciprocally gives. To assist him by providing him with the chance to pull his weight and contribute would be to help him out. To simply feed and house him by virtue of his status as citizen, asking nothing in return, is to degrade him.&nbsp;</p><div id="youtube2-yTwpBLzxe4U" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;yTwpBLzxe4U&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yTwpBLzxe4U?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>And there is something worse than the social democratic state forcing you to be a moocher. It is watching it enable others to get away with being moochers themselves. We heard this on Mitt Romney’s post–2012 election conference call:</p><blockquote><p>The president’s campaign… focused on giving targeted groups a big gift… forgiveness of college loan interest… free contraceptives were very big with young, college-aged women…. [For] African American voters, ‘Obamacare’ was a huge plus… getting free healthcare worth, what, $10,000 a family, in perpetuity, I mean this is huge…. With regards to Hispanic voters, the amnesty for the children of illegals…</p></blockquote><p>And in Mitt Romney’s leaked dinnertime conversation:</p><blockquote><p>There are 47 percent who are with him: who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it…. My job is is not to worry about those people. I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives…</p></blockquote><p>Now Mitt Romney is not a bad man. He will be either my 51st or 52nd favorite out of the 100 senators in the next congress. And he has a strong, visceral aversion to social democracy precisely because it offers a drop of “to each according to their needs”.</p><p>The takeaway: social democracy—the New Deal Order—failed its sustainability test at the end of the 1970s. Perhaps it could have been revived and restored, even if somewhat zombie-like. Certainly those of us who worked for Bill Clinton or Tony Blair thought so. But I think people go too far when they see the coming of the Second Gilded Age as unhappy accident, or even as simply the consequence of r &gt; g in a world of demographic and productivity slowdown.</p><p>There are an embarrassingly large number of powerful candidates for the Neoliberal Turn ranging from the large political megaphones that money can buy through the vulnerability of social democracies to rent-seeking to the deep structure of human or perhaps only Indo-European language thought in placing a very high value on reciprocal gift-exchange as social glue. That the even moderate steps toward less income and wealth inequality taken during the age of social democracy proved unsustainable should give all those who wish for it pause.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/stone-lecture-inequality-continues/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/stone-lecture-inequality-continues/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>4. What to Do?</h3><p>Finally, I arrive at the fourth part of my talk: Given all this, what should I do? What should we do? What should you do?</p><p>Remember, first, that economics’s utilitarian roots place an extremely high value on equality. We have every reason to think that the marginal utility of consumption declines steeply with wealth, even after we have gotten out of the range where a 50% increase in family wealth, cuts infant mortality by 50% and raises adult height by 2 inches. Any aversion to interpersonal comparisons of utility turns out, in practice, to be a claim that maybe it does not matter if they are poor because they would not appreciate the finer things. It is obvious how to judge any such claims.</p><p>Remember, second, that economics’s libertarian roots also place an extremely high value on equality. Absolute wealth is power over nature. Relative wealth is social power: power to seek the attention and assistance of others, to have a voice in what we are collectively going to do—and it is collectively, because on our own each of us would have a life nasty, brutish, and likely to be short. As John Stuart Mill wrote, the lives of the poor are lives of degradation and imprisonment. If one is locked in a cage, it does not matter much whether there is no key or whether one is just not rich enough to buy a key</p><p>Remember, third, ethical philosophy also places an extremely high value on equality. We have none of us made anything by our hand and brain alone, but only through what has been freely gifted to us in the form of this planet and of the accumulated stock of human wisdom, to which we are all heirs.</p><p>We understand why, before 1870, human societies were greatly unequal: humanity had no chance of baking a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have enough. Those who did have enough did so by virtue of their participation in the élite’s domination-and-exploitation scheme. Since 1870 humanity has accomplished a great deal: we now have the technological powers to bake a sufficiently large economic pie that everyone living before 1870 would have seen as certainly more than enough. Yet, although we have solved the problem of baking a sufficiently large economic pie, The problems of slicing and tasting it—of equitably distributing our collective wealth, and of utilizing it wisely and well so that people live lives in which they feel safe and secure, and are healthy and happy —those continue to flummox us, more or less completely.</p><p>That the social democratic order collapsed so rapidly around 1980 makes me think we should look back and try to figure out why it had not collapsed earlier—what had changed then? I am tempted to put forward the hypothesis that what had changed was the aging of those with visceral memories of the Great Depression and of World War II, who had in the front of their minds an unusually strong degree of empathy with others, remembering how the world, chance, and fate had demonstrated that we were all in this together.</p><p>So perhaps the first step is to recognize that this loss of solidarity is odd, for we are all in this together.</p><p>In his&nbsp;<em>Wealth of Nations</em>, Adam Smith argues against those who claim that a more unequal society is a better society, for in a more unequal society the rich and the government can get more work out of the poor for the same amount of coin. Adam Smith pulls an intellectual-judo move, drawing on expectations about gift-exchange:</p><blockquote><p>No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, clothe, and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodged…</p></blockquote><p>There are people in Pakistan whom I do not know who wove the carpets that are on the floor of my house. Whenever one of dogs looks like it might vomit, we frantically hustle them outside because the rugs are things of great beauty, which enrich our lives. In fact we should spend more time than we do looking down at them and admiring them. The thing about a well-functioning gift-exchange relationship is that each party benefits greatly on net, and each party believes that the current favor balance is against it, so it needs to do more and thus to strengthen the relationship.</p><p>Every time I walk on any of my carpets, I should think: I am really one-down with respect to the balance of favors vis-à-vis the people in Pakistan who wove this, and I should strive harder to appreciate the artistic gift they have given me, and find more ways to better their lives. I should take care that they’re somewhere close to the front of my mind.</p><p>I wish I had more to offer you. But I do, at least, have this. Thank you very much.</p><div><hr></div><p>As Michael Walzer once told me, when one starts a book project one is confident that at the end, when one holds the finished copy in one’s hands and opens it, one will see letters of fire that will by the logic of iron necessity inscribe their truth directly on the minds and souls of readers, and that the book will be&nbsp;<em>κτῆμά τε ἐς αἰεὶ,&nbsp;</em>a treasure for all time. But when the actual book appeared—no letters of fire, no direct truth, just chicken-scratchings that were not even the shadows on the wall of the cave, but rather vague gestures in the direction of shadows from which a good-hearted and hard-working reader might learn&nbsp;<em><strong>something. </strong></em>Basic is not in the business of publishing thousand-page books.&nbsp;And I very much doubt that I could have successfully executed a thousand-page book: the difficulty of the dive goes with the square of the number of pages. I wound up writing a book looking forward from 1870 that is overwhelmingly about the political-economy consequences of the magnificent explosion in the rate of technology-driven growth, with occasional side-glances at the parts of the original project that I was unable to execute.</p>
