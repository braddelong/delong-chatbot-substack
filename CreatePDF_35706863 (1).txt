I'm a dude with the usual amount of bullshit on his karma; I try to imagine the better version of 
me, and then cosplay that in public until hopefully it sticks. Or to quote Vonnegut:
"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be."

@scalzi You seem like a really nice guy, and you write really good books.

Paragraphs:

John Quiggin: Republicans & the End of Hard Neoliberalism: a€~ After four years of the Trump 
Administration, and a few months of post-election madness, the Republican Party
has completed a transition that has been going on for decades. In the 1980s and 1990s, the 
Republicans were a hard neoliberal partya€i. Now the situation is reversed. The
Republicans are a white grievance partya€! [that] still attempt to attract support from 
corporations by advocating tax cutsa€!.

Think of the Eisenhower-era Republican party as a complicated mixture of many dissolved 
ingredients, in which the dominant element was the business establishment, and the
Trump era party as a crystalised mass of plutocratic economics, racism and all-round craziness. The 
development over the 60 years between the two has consisted of keeping the
mixture simmering, while adding more and more appeals to racial animus and magical thinking 
(supply-side economics, climate denial, the Iraq war and so on). In this process
various elements of the original mix have boiled off or precipitated out and discarded as dregs.

Boiling off is the process by which various groups (Blacks and Northeastern liberal Republicans in 
C20, liberaltarians more recently) have left the Republican coalition in response
to its racism and know-nothingism. The dregs that have precipitated out are ideas that were 
supposed to be important to Republicans (free trade, scientific truth, classical liberalism,
moral character and so on) that turned out not to matter at all. Trumpa€™ s arrival is the catalyst 
seed crystal that produces the phase change. The final product of the reaction
emerges in its crystallised form.

Matthew Zeitlin: Personnel Isna€™ t Policy, Policy Is Personnel'. a€~Janet Yellen is a fiscal and 
monetary hawk. Or at least she was. Sorta. But no longera€!. The Biden
administration, as might be expected, has many of the same figures from the Obama years and even 
the Clinton yearsa€!. Yellen herself was Obamaa€™ s choice to run the Federal
Reserve  and the chair of Bill Clintona€™ s Council of Economic Advisors after some time on the Fed 
Board. While on the Fed and in the Clinton White House, she supported
policies  that would be anathema to the current administration, she was affiliated with deficit 
hawk groups that, for now, have no particular hold over current Democratic Party
thinking. And yet I have no doubt that Yellen will be an effective advocate and architect of 
exactly what the Biden administration and Democratic congress wants to do right: spend
money on families, Covid relief, the environment, and not get too stressed about the deficita€!.

It wasna€™ t Larry Summers who allegedly told Romer that monetary policy had a€oeshot its wad,a€D 
or tried to explain high unemployment with reference to bank tellers and
ATMs. It was Barack Obamaa€!. We are attuned to a model where advisors influence and shape the 
thinking of their a€ceprincipal,a€D but it seems just as likely that the principal
shapes the advisors, or essentially farms out different a€oemodulesa€n of thinking to different 
people (a deficit hawk here, a stimulus advocate there, a health care reformer over
there) and then shifts the degree to which she takes their input in accordance with what she 
already wants to do. Inasmuch as the advisors differ, they differ within a fairly narrow
band set by the principals!. [Summers] is as on board for more spending as anyone in Greater 
Bidenberga€”but will remain at least somewhat estranged, even if the winds of
change blow from the same direction both within and without ita€!

Antonio Gramsci: Prison Notebooks IIP. a€™That facet of todaya€™ s crisis which is lamented as a 
a€oewave of materialisms□ is related to the so-called Soecrisis of
authoritySD. The ruling class has lost its coordinations”is not leading but merely dominant solely 
by force. The overwhelming majority no longer believe what they used to
believe,    and so have become unmoored from the ideologies of tradition. This, precisely, is the 
crisis: The old order is dying. The new order cannot be born. There is an interregnum.
It   is a time of monstersS!.

Can a gap between the popular majority and the ideologies of the rulers as serious as that since 
World War I ended be bridged by simple force, which attempts to stop the ideologies
of the future from coming to organize society. Will the current interregnum end not in the 
normal-history process, which naked force blocks, but rather in a restoration? The shape
of the ideologies is such that that can be ruled out in any practical if not absolute sense, he 
character of the ideologies, that can be ruled out-yet not in an absolute sense. In the
meantime depression will lead eventually to wide scepticism, and a new accommodation^’’Catholicism 
will even more become simply Jesuitism, and so forth.

These are highly favorable conditions for an unprecedented expansion of Marxisma€™ s influence. 
Marxisma€™ s oversimplicity and inadequacy when it takes its popular form
will help it spread. Dead old ideologies turn into skepticism with respect to all theories and 
frameworks, to a focus on economic fact and money, and to politics that is either
fantastical or cynicala€!. But this reduction to economic money and to political power means 
exactly the disappearance of established frameworks of ideas as anything other than
rationalizations. That opens up the possibilitya€”and creates the necessitya€”of creating the new 
culturea€!
