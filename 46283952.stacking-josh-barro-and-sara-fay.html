Yet my normie position—an apparently “contrarian” one if you looked on Twitter in January 2020—was weirdly absent from the commentariat…. I am contrarian in relation to that subculture, but not to our overall politics or society, within which I sit closer to the median than most other people you will hear from in the press…. My intention with this newsletter is to offer… coverage that punctures conventional wisdom on politics, business, the economy, and mayonnaise…. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you’ll get my Very Serious takes on politics, business and the economy. On Wednesdays… the Mayonnaise Clinic, a weekly dialogue with readers…. On Fridays we’ll release the Very Serious with Josh Barro podcast….

First… I want Democrats to win, and I think a lot of the things they are doing are interfering with that goal. Some Democratic officeholders—and many of the liberal activists those officeholders have failed to gain enough distance from—have taken wacky positions…. They also haven’t done enough to show voters they’re taking inflation seriously, though President Biden and his team have gotten better on that lately, which I appreciate. I think public dissatisfaction with Democrats on these issues is going to be a way bigger determinant of who controls the government in coming years than the number of ballot drop boxes in Fulton County or whatever procedural issue liberals are obsessing about this week. While “Republicans are worse” is a good enough reason for me to vote Democratic in the midterms, I don’t think it’s going to be a good enough reason for enough voters to get Democrats over the top by itself. And that’s why I’ll be pushing for my party not to screw up….

And I at least expect to learn a lot from them. Why? Because I already did, before they started this “Very Serious” venture. And because I know where they are coming from and understand it: they do not want Democrats to do stupid s—- that pointlessly alienates median voters, and they do not want Democrats to do stupid s—- that is counterproductive policy that leaves the country worse-off. I am not always going to agree with them as to what is stupid and not-stupid, but I do not have to worry that there is some editor who wants “the appearance of balance” or some source that needs to be beat-sweetened in the background pulling the strings.</p><p>That they are joining is good news about the ‘Stack as a… we might as well call it a “Web3 public sphere”.

There’s a petulant, “f— it, taking my ball and go home,” attitude with this, rather than, “it’s my responsibility to deal with this imperfect mess even if the people aren’t all doing exactly what I tell them to do”: </p><blockquote><p>A senior administration official argued an effort to send N95 or KN95 masks to Americans would make little difference because ‘half the country won’t wear any mask.’ ‘It may be popular in certain corners of Twitter, but for masking to work as a public health tool, people need to actually wear them…’” Plenty of people wear masks, plenty of people are willing to wear masks, all of those people would happily wear <em>better masks.</em> Polls show lots of support for wearing masks, and even if there are corners of the country where this is not the majority view, it’s still a substantial minority view and every little bit helps. Another reason to do it, like many other things, is to signal that it’s important, to model behavior by putting resources behind it…</p></blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.eschatonblog.com/2022/01/what-fuck-is-wrong-with-these-people.html">https://www.eschatonblog.com/2022/01/what-fuck-is-wrong-with-these-people.html</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Toni Morriso</strong>: <em>Ten Steps Towards Fascism</em>: ‘1.

They are active constructions in which the brain’s top-down, inside-out predictions about what’s going on are continuously calibrated by sensory signals flowing in the opposite (outside-in) direction. By treating sensory signals as prediction errors, and trying to minimize them everywhere and all the time, the brain settles and re-settles on a continuously evolving best-guess of the causes of these sensory signals, and this best guess is what we consciously perceive. The distinctive thing about experiences of emotion and mood is that the relevant causes are to be found within the body, rather than out there in the world…. The brain has no direct access to physiological states of the body, and so these states have to be inferred through best guessing…. All of our perceptions and experiences, whether of the self or of the world, are inside-out controlled and controlling hallucinations that are rooted in the flesh-and-blood predictive machinery that evolved, develops, and operates from moment-to-moment, always in light of a fundamental biological drive to stay alive…</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://nautil.us/issue/111/spotlight/we-are-beast-machines">https://nautil.us/issue/111/spotlight/we-are-beast-machines</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Matthew Yglesias</strong>: <em>Jamaica &amp; the Case for Energy Abundance</em>: ‘Noah Smith did an interesting post just before Christmas on what’s worked and what hasn’t for Jamaica…. The tl;dr is that Jamaica hasn’t really managed to get on the manufacturing train to supplement and complement their tourism sector (which is a notorious development dead end) and natural resource exports…. This saga does seem to me to intersect with an obsession of mine: energy abundance…. What’s Jamaica’s problem here? Well, a majority of their exports are made up of bauxite, a material that’s used to make aluminum. This is lucrative enough to keep the value of Jamaica’s currency high and make it a bad place from which to do very low-end globally competitive manufacturing. But the blessing of even the lowest-end manufacturing is that it gets you on the path of export discipline where you can move up the value chain from apparel to light goods to more advanced products.
