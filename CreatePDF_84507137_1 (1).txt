FOCUS: Quantum Financial Suicide, SBF, & FTX:


a€oeBahamas and Quantum Financial Suicidea€D by Stable Diffusion via NightCafe

Matt Levinea€™ s Money Stuff Newsletter is 7450 words this morning, most on SBF but some on Twitter 
and other topicsa€!
And Byrne Hobart writes what I was going to write, and writes it better:

Byrne Hobart: Money, Credit, Trust, and FTX: a€~The north star for intelligent risk management is 
the Kelly Criteriona€! maximize log(wealth); in other words, identifying the bet size that will 
produce the highest compounding returns without any risk of either a) losing everything, or b) 
equivalently, losing so much that there's no way to recovera€!. But for a utilitarian who plans to 
give away all of their money, the utility of wealth is
roughly linear for all plausible sumsa€!. Was the utilitarianism stuff just bluster to defend a 
sociopathic moneymaking scheme? Probably not. SBF was writing about utilitarianism for years before 
he started Alameda, and before he was even working in financea€!.

Continuously betting big, with nonzero odds of failure, will eventually lead to some kind of 
drawdown. Doing a full Kelly bet can lead to extreme drawdowns, even with perfect play; maximizing 
log(wealth) also means having a level of volatility that few people can reasonably toleratea€!. SBF 
argued that you shouldn't bet based on expected(log(wealth)), but based on expected(wealth)a€!. 
Going past Kelly doesn't mean trading more
risk for more return, it means taking on so much risk that there's no possibility of a good 
long-term return!

There are three plausible ways this overbetting strategy can be rescued from the curse of blowup 
risk. The first is that there's an overlap between the Effective Altruist community and belief in 
the Many-Worlds interpretation of, which can be interpreted to mean that when probabilities don't 
work out, there's a world in which they do, and you can't privilege this world over that one just 
because you happen to be stuck in the unlucky
version of reality. It's quantum suicide but for financea€!.

A second option is that this kind of utilitarian risk-on behavior is happening in parallela€!. When 
SBF looks at a bet with a 1% chance of paying off, he shouldna€™ t think of this as a one-time 
proposition, because other EAs will find similar bets, and take them. If other peoplea€™ s utility 
matches your own and enough other people are running the same moral source code you are, then the 
Law of Large Numbers appliesa€!. Full Kelly
underbets because the bankroll is much bigger than it looks.

And a third possibility is that SBF was maximizing arithmetic returns rather than geometric returns 
because he saw the crypto boom as a one-time, and temporary, opportunitya€!. You don't care about 
compounding, because your bet won't compounda€!.

Regardless of the exact justification, FTX/Alameda persistently bet big. And, at some point, they 
tapped the invisible line of credit ($), moved assets to where they shouldn't be, and eventually 
got caughta€!. Expected(Log(wealth)) is hard to escape, because linear extrapolation to arbitrary 
values will always produce absurdities. Nature abhors an oversimplified model, though the way 
nature deals with it is only obvious in retrospecta€!

MUST-READ: Charles Dickens: Little Dorrit: Ch 21: Mr. Merdlea€™s Complaint:

Harley Street, Cavendish Square, was more than aware of Mr and Mrs Merdle. Intruders there were in 
Harley Street, of whom it was not aware; but Mr and Mrs Merdle it delighted to honour. Society was 
aware of Mr and Mrs Merdle. Society had said a€~Let us license them; let us know them.a€™

Mr Merdle was immensely rich; a man of prodigious enterprise; a Midas without the ears, who turned 
all he touched to gold. He was in everything good, from banking to building. He was in Parliament, 
of course. He was in the City, necessarily. He was Chairman of this, Trustee of that, President of 
the other. The weightiest of men had said to projectors, a€~Now, what name have you got? Have you 
got Merdle?a€™ And, the reply being in the negative, had
said, a€~Then I wona€™ t look at you.a€™ a€!

There was a dinner giving in the Harley Street establishment, while Little Dorrit was stitching at 
her fathera€™ s new shirts by his side that night; and there were magnates from the Court and 
magnates from the City, magnates from the Commons and magnates from the Lords, magnates from the 
bench and magnates from the bar, Bishop magnates, Treasury magnates, Horse Guard magnates, 
Admiralty magnates ,a€’’all the magnates that keep us going, and
sometimes trip us up.

a€~I am told,a€™ said Bishop magnate to Horse Guards, a€~that Mr Merdle has made another enormous 
hit. They say a hundred thousand pounds .a€™
Horse Guards had heard two.

Treasury had heard three.

Bar, handling his persuasive double eye-glass, was by no means clear but that it might be four. It 
was one of those happy strokes of calculation and combination, the result of which it was difficult 
to estimate. It was one of those instances of a comprehensive grasp, associated with habitual luck 
and characteristic boldness, of which an age presented us but few. But here was Brother Bellows, 
who had been in the great Bank case, and who could probably tell us
more. What did Brother Bellows put this new success at?

Brother Bellows was on his way to make his bow to the bosom, and could only tell them in passing 
that he had heard it stated, with great appearance of truth, as being worth, from first to last, 
half-a-million of money.

Admiralty said Mr Merdle was a wonderful man, Treasury said he was a new power in the country, and 
would be able to buy up the whole House of Commons. Bishop said he was glad to think that this 
wealth flowed into the coffers of a gentleman who was always disposed to maintain the best 
interests of Society.
Mr Merdle himself was usually late on these occasions, as a man still detained in the clutch of 
giant enterprises when other men had shaken off their dwarfs for the daya€!.

Bar fell into discussion with Horse Guards concerning courts-martial. Brothers Bellows and Bench 
struck in. Other magnates paired off. Mr Merdle sat silent, and looked at the table-cloth. 
Sometimes a magnate addressed him, to turn the stream of his own particular discussion towards him; 
but Mr Merdle seldom gave much attention to it, or did more than rouse himself from his 
calculations and pass the wine.
When they rose, so many of the magnates had something to say to Mr Merdleindividually that he held 
little levees by the sideboard, and checked them off as they went out at the door.

Treasury hoped he might venture to congratulate one of Englanda€™ s world-famed capitalists and 
merchant-princes (he had turned that original sentiment in the house a few times, and it came easy 
to him) on a new achievement. To extend the triumphs of such men was to extend the triumphs and 
resources of the nation; and Treasury felta€”he gave Mr Merdle to understands’’patriotic on the 
subject.
a€~Thank you, my lord,a€™ said Mr Merdle; a€~thank you. I accept your congratulations with pride, 
and I am glad you approves™

S~Why, I donS™ t unreservedly approve, my dear Mr Merdle. Because,S™ smiling Treasury turned him by 
the arm towards the sideboard and spoke banteringly, S~it never can be worth your while to come 
among us and help us.S™
Mr Merdle felt honoured by theS”

S~No, no,S™ said Treasury, S~that is not the light in which one so distinguished for practical 
knowledge and great foresight, can be expected to regard it. If we should ever be happily enabled, 
by accidentally possessing the control over circumstances, to propose to one so eminent toS”to come 
among us, and give us the weight of his influence, knowledge, and character, we could only propose 
it to him as a duty. In fact, as a duty that he owed to
Society .a€™

Mr Merdle intimated that Society was the apple of his eye, and that its claims were paramount to 
every other consideration. Treasury moved on, and Bar came up.

Bar, with his little insinuating jury droop, and fingering his persuasive double eye-glass, hoped 
he might be excused if he mentioned to one of the greatest converters of the root of all evil into 
the root of all good, who had for a long time reflected a shining lustre on the annals even of our 
commercial countrya€”if he mentioned, disinterestedly, and as, what we lawyers called in our 
pedantic way, amicus curiae, a fact that had come by accident within his
knowledge. He had been required to look over the title of a very considerable estate in one of the 
eastern countiesa€’’lying, in fact, for Mr Merdle knew we lawyers loved to be particular, on the 
borders of two of the eastern counties. Now, the title was perfectly sound, and the estate was to 
be purchased by one who had the command ofa€”Money (jury droop and persuasive eye-glass), on 
remarkably advantageous terms. This had come to Bara€™ s knowledge
only    that day, and it had occurred to him, a€~I shall have the honour of dining with my esteemed 
friend Mr Merdle this evening, and, strictly between ourselves, I will mention the opportunity.a€™ 
Such a purchase would involve not only a great legitimate political influence, but some half-dozen 
church presentations of considerable annual value. Now, that Mr Merdle was already at no loss to 
discover means of occupying even his capital, and of fully employing
even his active and vigorous intellect, Bar well knew: but he would venture to suggest that the 
question arose in his mind, whether one who had deservedly gained so high a position and so 
European a reputation did not owe ita€”we would not say to himself, but we would say to Society, to 
possess himself of such influences as these; and to exercise thema€”we would not say for his own, 
or for his partya€™ s, but we would say for Societya€™ sa€”benefit.

Mr Merdle again expressed himself as wholly devoted to that object of his constant consideration, 
and Bar took his persuasive eye-glass up the grand staircase. Bishop then came undesignedly sidling 
in the direction of the sideboard.

Surely the goods of this world, it occurred in an accidental way to Bishop to remark, could 
scarcely be directed into happier channels than when they accumulated under the magic touch of the 
wise and sagacious, who, while they knew the just value of riches (Bishop tried here to look as if 
he were rather poor himself), were aware of their importance, judiciously governed and rightly 
distributed, to the welfare of our brethren at large.
Mr Merdle with humility expressed his conviction that Bishop couldna€™ t mean him, and with 
inconsistency expressed his high gratification in Bishopa€™ s good opinion.

Bishop thena€’’jauntily stepping out a little with his well-shaped right leg, as though he said to 
Mr Merdle a€~dona€™ t mind the apron; a mere form!a€™ put this case to his good friend:

Gillian Tett: Cryptoa€™ s future may be divided, not dead: a€~This is the crypto version of the 
2008 Lehman Brothers shocka€l. So does this mean that crypto will now die?a€l Opacity is costlya€l. 
Custodya€! practices have long been a dangerous messa€l. In theory, these problems could be fixed 
if crypto were forced to adopt the same regulatory tenets around custody and transparency as 
fuddy-duddy fiat-based financea€l. [But] there is still a large pool of
players who use digital assets to evade government controlsa€l. [And] central bank digital 
currency, or CBDC, experiments are heating up, not least because, as I was told last month, the 
government of China (and, to a lesser extent, Europe) want CBDCs to displace private digital 
assetsa€l Either way, prepare for more twistsa€l

Brad Stone: FTX Implodes, and a Top VC Backer Falls on Its Face: a€~In late September, the Sequoia 
Capital website published a long, meandering profile of Sam Bankman-Frieda€l an eye-glazing 14,000 
wordsa€! flowery prose that looked especially ridiculous after FTXa€™ s spectacular collapse. 
Sections of the story were turned into memes, labeled as god-tier comedy and generally subjected to 
widespread mockerya€!. Now, this is not to dunk on the
storya€™ s author, Adam Fischer, a longtime Silicon Valley journalist (and friend!). Journalism can 
be a humbling business, and anyone practicing the craft long enough is apt to become the victim of 
unfortunate timinga€l. What happened nexta€l. The article disappeared entirely from the site. 
Visitors who followed old links to the piece were redirected to a note the venture capital firm had 
sent its investors, citing an uncertain future for FTX. At most
mainstream news organizations, this is a journalistic tabooa€l. But Sequoia didna€™ t follow that 
scripta€l. The firm declined to comment on the movea€l

Duncan Black: A Triumphant Victory For The Forces Of Wokeness: a€~I do want to restate that every 
political journalist had a pre-write sitting in the CMS about how, as usual, Democrats Were Out Of 
Touch With Real Americans, what with loving crime and having kids shit in litterboxes and treating 
trans people as human beings. No one really cares about democracy, why won't Joey shut about that? 
And then they just... couldn't run them. Their intended
narrative wasn't based on polls, just vibes. "Dems keeping the Senate" was a perfectly reasonable 
prediction given polling and the House is always a bit of a guess. With redistricting there was 
reason for pessimism, but again that's just guessing. There are never enough good polls.Again, I am 
not claiming a victory for full communism, but all the stuff the Right spent screeching about for 
the last several months, which journalists always echo, didn't work for
them. One thing I don't see remarked upon much is that despite the pretty undemocratic nature of 
the Senate - leaning heavily against the Democrats - they manage to keep it much of the time! Even 
now!

Steven Beschloss: Red Waving, Fox News and Sanity's Survival: a€~They hyped a GOP blow-out, but a 
desire to calm the extremism has largely won the day. Now we'll see if the loss only exacerbates 
the madness that is Trump and Trumpisma€l. Before looking ahead to the expected presidential 
announcement tomorrow by the leading purveyor of violent, sociopathic incitements to get and keep 
power, I thought it useful to look back at how many Republicans
became convinced of their omnipotence and the inevitability of their overwhelming victory in the 
midterms. In short, look no further than the Fox News bubble and its chief propagandists determined 
to spread their narrative, reality be damneda€l. No matter what issue I was addressing online, I 
was getting bombarded by a€oered wave-ists,a€D possessed by certitude and hostilitya€I. Laughably, 
Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy said Sunday on NBC,
a€oeWea€™re not a cult. Wea€™re not like, OK, therea€™ s one person who leads our partya€l. We 
should be a party of ideas and principlesaCDaCI. I remain convinced that it will take indictments 
and prosecutions of Trumpa€”and the hard daily work of a€oedoing democracya€da€”if we are ever 
going to have a chance to put this constant danger behind usa€!

Nicholas Gruen: a€~From Slouching Towards Utopia: Brad DeLong: a€oeln 2003, the era in which the 
United States was the trusted leader of the global-north a€oeWestern alliancea€D came to an end. At 
the end of the 1980s, after the end of the Cold War, George H.W. Bush reassured the world that US 
military supremacy was benign because the US military would be deployed only in support of an 
overwhelming majority vote of a countrya€™ s people, or
according to the will of the UN Security Council. The Clinton administration had changed this to 
a€oeaccording to the will of the NATO alliancea€D; and then the George W. Bush administration had 
changed it to a€oemore or less at random, according to false and misleadingly interpreted 
intelligence, against countries that do not possess nuclear weapons.a€D Countries took notea€l
