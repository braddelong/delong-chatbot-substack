FRED — Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items Less Food and
Energy in U.S. City Average

— 5-Year, 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate


Paragraphs:

Ita€™ s not that a€oethe dynamics of identity politics are stronga€D, Matt. Ita€™ s that right-wing 
populism is concerned not with making peoplea€™ s lives better, but rather with making the Volk 
believe that they have better lives than the non-Vo Ik. The right-wing populist thinks that people 
who want to live in Austin should be prevented from doing so, because they are coded Black, Jewish, 
educated, a€oewokea€D, and the purpose of a right-wing populist
government is to make them unhappy:

Matthew Yglesias: Conservative Populists Should Embrace Housing Deregulation'. a€~While the leftist 
case against zoning reform is mistaken, the rightist case tends to be nonsensicala€!. Zoning reform 
proposal isa€! right-winga€! let people do what they want with their property a€! people should 
decide for themselvesa€!. But the dynamics of identity politics are strong, and Edward Ring in 
American Greatness tries to make a right­
populist take where housing abundance is good but density is also bada€!. Therea€™ s no reason 
Texas shouldna€™ t keep building more homes in the suburbs of Austin. But that said, if some people 
would rather live in Austin proper, why shouldna€™ t that be allowed, too?a€!

On David Brooksa€™ s wishy-washy half-recognition that he has spent his life working for grifters 
and thugs, and that FDR might have been a relatively good guy after all:

Yastreblyansky: Distrust Doom Loop'. a€~Hear me out here, maybe Roosevelt and the Brain Trust 
werena€™ t thinking about the coming war at all. Maybe they were actually thinking about rescuing 
millions of Americans from hunger, homelessness, and despair just because they thought that was 
their job. Maybe the trust in government that largely lasted for the next 40 or 50 years had to do 
with the fact that the government installed
in 1933 actually was trustworthy. And maybe instead of deploying just enough New Deal to get you 
through the specific context of that Distrust Doom Loop you could use moderately massive government 
spending (the kind of thing the Lincoln administration meant by suggesting that the people should 
be governed by the people on behalf of the people and then proceeding to a massive expansion of 
public education and transportation
infrastructure in the middle of a civil war) all the time, even when it seems inconvenient, with 
the idea that if the government was trustworthy all the time those unpredictable Distrust Doom 
Loops would never arise. Just a thoughta€!

Drew Austin: Paid in Full'. a€~As with Web 2.0, third-party applications will mediate most Web3 
activity for ordinary users. These decentralized apps will not necessarily look and feel altogether 
different than traditional web apps but will likely incorporate functionalitya€! like crowdfunding 
to be incorporated directlya€!. Interactions will become transactionsa€!. Web 2.0 has already 
demonstrated that information cana€™t be free; it can only be subsidized,
most likely by entities with deep pockets and nefarious interestsa€!

John Maynard Keynes: The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. a€~The only radical 
cure for the crises of confidence which afflict the economic life of the modern world would be to 
allow the individual no choice between consuming his income and ordering the production of the 
specific capital-asset which, even though it be on precarious evidence, impresses him as the most 
promising investment available to him. It might be that, at times
when he was more than usually assailed by doubts concerning the future, he would turn in his 
perplexity towards more consumption and less new investment. But that would avoid the disastrous, 
cumulative and far-reaching repercussions of its being open to him, when thus assailed by doubts, 
to spend his income neither on the one nor on the other. Those who have emphasised the social 
dangers of the hoarding of money have, of course, had something similar to
the above in mind. But they have overlooked the possibility that the phenomenon can occur without 
any change, or at least any commensurate change, in the hoarding of moneya€!
