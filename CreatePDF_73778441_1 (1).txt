Slouching Towards Utopia

An Economic History of the Twentieth Century

BASIC BOOKS 2020

<https://newbooksnetwork.com/an-economic-history-of-the-twentieth-century>

From one of the world's leading economists, a grand narrative of the century that made us richer 
than ever, yet left us unsatisfied Before 1870, humanity lived in dire poverty, with a
slow crawl of invention offset by a growing population. Then came a great shift: invention sprinted 
forward, doubling our technological capabilities each generation and utterly
transforming the economy again and again. Our ancestors would have presumed we would have used such 
powers to build utopia. But it was not so. When 1870-2010 ended, the
world instead saw global warming; economic depression, uncertainty, and inequality; and broad 
rejection of the status quo.

Brad DeLong's Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History o f the Twentieth Century (Basic Books, 
2022) tells the story of how this unprecedented explosion of material
wealth occurred, how it transformed the globeâ€”and why it failed to deliver us to utopia. Of 
remarkable breadth and ambition, it uncovers the last century to have been less a march
of progress than a slouch in the right direction.
