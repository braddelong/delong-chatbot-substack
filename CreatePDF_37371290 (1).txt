Paragraphs:

Equitable Growth: Data Infrastructure for the 21st Century: A Focus on Racial Equity: a€~Largea€! 
racial divides in income, wealth, employment, and other markers of economic well-beinga€! have a 
tragic human
costa€l. Pay discrimination, barriers to wealth accumulation, and other forms of systemic racism 
prevent people from developing and fully deploying their human capital. The Biden administration 
hasa€! an Equitable Data
Working Group. Across many domains, federal data collection and reporting can be improved to better 
reflect the diversity of our economy. These improvements could then guide policymakers in 
implementing more finely
tuned policies to address the legacy of systemic racism and the differential impacts of recessions 
and other economic shocks on communities of color. This event will convene a panel of academics to 
discuss some actionable
areas of policy where the Biden administration could take steps to increase the quality and utility 
of economic data disaggregation and how these steps will lead to better policy outcomes. Please 
direct questions related to
event content to Computational Social Scientist, Austin Clemensa€!

Brackety Jack: Absent Gods, Absent Catastrophes: The Sharing Knife and The Lord of the Rings: a€~A 
separate people, taller and grimmera€! descended from different stock, they inherit a lifelong, 
unthanked task of battle,
expending greater lifespans in patrolling and defending all against an ancient preternatural evil, 
only to be repaid with dark suspicionsa€! and wilful ignorance of their nobility and sacrifice. 
Nomadic and martial, ruthlessly
disciplined, and deeply attuned to their horses, they have astonishing field-, wood-, and warcraft, 
and the knowledge and capacity to heal in ways that seem mystical to ordinary peoplea€”with whom 
they do not intermarry.
And   they possess weapons that can kill preternatural evil as ordinary weapons cannot. Every word 
applies equally to Lakewalkers and DA°nedain, and this is not imitation but critique, for there are 
also pointed differences,
and the Lakewalkersa€™ struggle is by far the bleakera€!. The DA°nedain, that is, struggle in hope, 
buoyed by received wisdoms promising deliverance and assisted by beings and artefacts of ancient, 
sometimes
preternatural provenance; Lakewalkers, contrariwise, struggle without hope of deliverance, knowing 
a single failure will end the world, and their only artefacts of power are worked from their own 
bones and sacrificesa€!.

Nor do Lakewalkers have any certain knowledge of the past that led to their present, even their 
legends being fragmentarya€!. Bujold has repeatedly confirmed that she was consciously engaging 
with Tolkiena€™ s
masterwork and the subgenre it createda€!. In a discussion on Jo Waltona€™ s Tor blog in 2009, 
someone complained that The Sharing Knife did not have a proper ending, because evil was not 
ultimately defeated, and
Bujold,   rather (I imagine) banging her head on her desk, replied: "Not only was [the Ultimate 
Defeat of All Evil] not the story I was telling, it was the story my entire 1600 page story was 
arguing againsta€!. There is a trick to
deliberately thwarting reader expectationsa€”you have to deliver in the end something as good or 
bettera€!. Which is harder than it soundsa€’’those narrative habits are so ingrained because they 
work, over and over. And
overa€!

Jeet Heer: Contra the Covid Contrarians: a€~58 per cent of Americans now believe the virus 
originated in a Chinese lab (up from 49 per cent last year). More startlingly, 24 per cent of 
Americans (including 39 per cent of
Republicans) believe the virus a€oewas created in a laboratory and released on purpose ,a€C With 
these poll numbers, we can see the seeds of a future war being planted right nowa€! Politically 
motivated rhetorical sleight of
hand is well underway, with the Cottons of the world using supposition to imply not just Chinese 
governmental negligence but vast war crimes. And centrist contrarians will have helped make that 
connection happena€!

Steve M.: Noonan: Everyone Is to Blame for the Rise in Right-Wing Conspiratorialism Except 
Right-Wingers: a€~Peggy Noonan has just published a€oean attempt to get at some of whata€™ s behind 
conspiracisma€na€!
QAnona€l the belief that Donald Trumpa€! will soon be reinatated as president. First she blames 
human nature, as well as the nature of life in Americaa€! a€cewokea€D mainstream-media newsroomsa€! 
those who
implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVIDa€“19 that Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott didna€™t 
likea€! The Transgender Menacea€! corporate progressivism, and activist progressivisma€! a€oethe 
elitesa€Da€!
technologya€!. But she never blames the people who are spreading the conspiracy theories. Trump 
isna€™t at fault. Her employer, Rupert Murdoch, isna€™t at fault. The rest of the right-wing media 
isna€™t at fault.

Conspiratorial Republican politicians arena€™t at fault. The people who write and retransmit QAnon 
posts and election-theft propaganda arena€™t at fault. We made them believe this stuff, with our 
woke atheist
transgender elitism. We made them concoct this nonsense, we made them spread it, we made them 
consume it. They didna€™ t want to. But wea€™re so awful that they had no choice!a€! This is her 
happy placea€’’blaming
us    for everything. Ita€™ s every other establishment right-wingera€™ s happy place, too, which 
might be why so many of them want to dump Trump and the conspiratorialists. The establishment right 
knows it cana€™ t
defend QAnon or Trump, so it wants them to go away, at which point everything bad in the world will 
be our fault againa€!

Adam Gurri: On Those Who Hate Twitter But Cannot Quit It: a€~Twitter is a vipera€™ s nesta€! a 
black hole which draws all intelligence, curiosity, and spontaneity to their oblivion. To speak 
earnestly on Twitter is to
invite mockery and a sudden outpouring of contempt from total strangersaC!. I have made more 
friends through Twitter than any other place, physical or digital. Beyond this close circle of 
friendship are those looser ties with
people who I gain much from, through the simple joy of conversation. And the audience I have built, 
however modest, around myself and around Liberal Currents, I owe to Twitter more than any other 
scenea€!. But
antagonism  is more likely than agreement, for antagonism draws a more energetic response, from the 
one replied to or their followers. And of course, the quote-tweet putting a hostile frame on the 
quoted tweet is one of the
most common paths to that promised land, going viral. Twittera€™ s specific mechanics certainly 
bear a great deal of blame for this state of affairs, and its caretakers have by and large only 
made matters worse with each
updatea€!

Cicero: Booksa€”Loyal, Forgiving Friends: a€~Know that since I got back to the city, I have renewed 
my relationships with my old friendsa€”by which I mean my books. It is not as if I avoided their 
presence because I was
judging them, but because they filled me with shame. For I believe that since I submitted myself to 
events with the most turbulent and faithless companions, I had insufficiently obeyed my booksa€™ 
commands. But they
have pardoned me. They welcome me back into that ancient communion and they tell me that you were 
wiser than I was because you persisted in this practice. But this is how I have achieved an 
understanding with them and
why I think I am right to hope that should I see you again it will be easy for me to manage 
whatever is happening and whatever threatens in the futurea€!

Jeet Heer: Is the GOP War on Democracy Self-Defeating? - The Time of Monsters: a€~The attacks on 
Kemp were usually coded in cultural and moral terms. Speaking about Steve Forbes, a Kemp-like 
optimist, Pat Buchanan
in 1996 said, a€oelta€™ s big rock candy mountain conservatism. They think economics is the answer 
to everything. Youa€™ ve got violence in the cities: Cut taxes and put enterprise zones in there 
and everythinga€™ s
going to be fine, and ita€™ s not. Therea€™ s a much broader dimension to Americaa€™ s crises: 
Ita€™ s moral, ita€™ s social, ita€™ s economic, ita€™ s spiritual.a€D If you believe that the 
purpose of politics is, at core,
to preserve a white American identity that you perceive to be under threat (from moral, social and 
spiritual enemies), then simply electing Republicans with the help of more non-white voters isna€™t 
something youa€™re
interested in. A broader Republican party will, from this point of view, be less loyal to the 
historical America, the white-dominated America, that the political right wants to defend. If that 
is your starting point, then shrinking
the electorate is in fact the only way to go. A multicultural Republican party would be a defeat. 
As Buchanan understood, politics isna€™ t just about policies. Ita€™ s also about mood. Kempa€™ s 
sunny, up-beat
conservatism didna€™ t appeal to people whose worldview has a darker, more pessimistic bent, people 
for whom Americaa€™ s changing demographics represent not opportunity but the end of their way of 
life. Can anyone
deny   that Buchanana€™ s somber outlook is more popular on the right than Kempa€™ s cheerfulness? 
Who, now, even remembers Jack Kemp?a€!
