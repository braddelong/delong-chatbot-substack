On those very rare occasions when he speaks, he says things like "candidate quality”. But what has led Republican primary electorates and Republican moneymen to choose low-quality candidates? The answer is this: when you turn up the partisan heat to 11, you make a political environment uncongenial for dealmakers and very convenient for grifters and for the unhinged. Had McConnell turn down the partisan hea—encouraged the 20 left-most members of his caucus to make deals and legislate where there was legislation to be done—he would, I think, I have spent not six but twelve of the sixteen years covered in the table above as majority leader.</p><p>Moreover, now he has created a Senate in which the right-most members of the Democratic Party are willing to vote for policies far to the left of those they are comfortable with just to stick it to McConnell.</p><p>And the Washington press corps portrays this as a successful stint as Republican leader?</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/mitch-mcconnell-as-republican-leader?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/mitch-mcconnell-as-republican-leader?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>TPM Newsmaker: </strong>Breaking Down the Midterms with Simon Rosenberg and Tom Bonier: Democratic strategists Simon Rosenberg and Tom Bonier were the two most prominent voices telling us for weeks that the 2022 Red Wave was a mirage.
