1. Abigail Smith Adams

1.1. Her Life: In 1764, in Britaina€™ s Massachusetts colony, Abigail Smith was 20. She had had no 
formal education at all: girls werena€™ t worth it. She married a man she had known for five years: 
the up-and-coming 30-year-old lawyer John Adams, future President of the United States.

Children rapidly followed their marriage: Nabby (1765), John Quincy (1767), Suky (1768, died at 2), 
Charles (1770, died at 10), and Thomas (1772). There was then, probably, a miscarriage or two or 
three from 1774-6. 1777 saw Elizabeth, stillborn). There may have been been another pregnancyor two 
afterwardsa€”but I suspect not: I suspect they stopped. Abigail Smith Adams spent five years 
pregnant. She was rich enough that she, perhaps, hireda wet-
nurse for her children, but somebody or somebodies nursed her children for perhaps fourteen more 
years. She or other women were thus eating for two for nearly two decades to raise the next 
generation of Adamses: that was a substantial biological energy load.

Death and disease were, as was the case in the Agrarian Age, omnipresent. People today read her 
letters. But they rarelya€”I would almost say a€~nevera€Da€’’focus on phrases like these: a€oeour 
Neighbour Trota€! striped of two lovely children in one weeka€!a€D, a€oeBetsy Cranch has been very 
bada€!a€D, a€oeBecky Peck they do not expect will live out the daya€!a€d, a€oe[her] affliction I 
mostsensibly feel but cannot discribea€!a€D, a€oeThe
Mumpsa€! Isaac is now confined with ita€!a€D, and a€oeyour Brothers youngest child lies bad with 
convulsion fittsa€!a€D

1.2. Her Most Famous Letter: In 1776 Abigail Smith Adams wrote a famous letter to her husband in 
which she begged him to write laws providing women with legal personality in the new revolutionary 
country, the United States of America, he was trying to create through the Revolutionary War he was 
so strongly committed to:

Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourablea€!. Do not put such unlimited power into 
the hands of the Husbandsa€L Such of you as wish to be happy willingly give up the harsh title of 
Master for the more tender and endearing one of Friend. Why then, not put it out of the power of 
the vicious and the Lawless to use us with cruelty and indignity with impunity?a€! Regard us then 
as Beings placed by providence under
your protection and in immitation of the Supreem Being make use of that power only for our 
happinessa€!


John Adams thought this was a great joke:

I cannot but laughd!. Your letter was the first intimation that another tribe, more numerous and 
powerful than all the rest, were grown discontented. This is rather too coarse a compliment, but 
you are so saucy, I won't blot it out. Depend upon it, we know better than to repeal our masculine 
systemsd!. We have only the name of masters, and rather than give up this, which would completely 
subject us to the despotism of the petticoat, I
hope General Washington and all our brave heroes would fightd!

Read the letter entire, and you learn that Abigail Smith Adams:

1. ran John Adamsd™ s Boston-Braintree household and property operations while he played on the 
political stage;

2. dealt with death and disease of children and neighbors that were omnipresent, with doeour 
Neighbour Trotd! striped of two lovely children in one weekdidd, doeBecky Peck they do not expect 
will live out the daydidd, doeyour Brothers youngest child lies bad with convulsion fittsdidD;

3. was desperate for news of what was going on in the wider world, for doel wish you would ever 
write me a Letter half as long as I write youd!. Where your Fleet are gone? What sort of Defence 
Virginia can make against our common Enemy? Whether it is so situated as to make an able Defence? 
Are not the Gentery Lords and the common people vassals? Are they not like the uncivilized Natives 
Brittain represents us to be?d!dD;

4. warns him to be very, very careful of the Massachusetts rebels alliance with the slaveholders of 
Virginia, for doel have sometimes been ready to think that the passion for Liberty cannot be

of theirsa€!a€D (note how she cannot say dcecannotdD or even "I think... cannotdD, even to her 
ten-years-older husband: she has to say "I have sometimes
been ready to think... cannotdD);

5. begs for at least some fig leaf of legal protection from abuse and brutality for her sisters, 
for the world as it is is very badly constituted, and her husband is one of those who has the 
opportunity to change itd”doeDo not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. 
Remember all Men would be tyrants if they couldd!. That your Sex are Naturally Tyrannical is a 
Truth so thoroughly established as to admit of no disputed!d”and, of

I                                                                          do not think her husband 
reacted well to her concerns.

A very talented, very energetic, very capable woman. Not typical: literate, smart as a whip, 
upwardly mobile, upper-class, married to a husband she couldd”somewhatd”talk to. But not worth 
teaching: she cand™ t spell. And she was confined by all those around here to a much narrower 
sphere of life than she could have occupiedd”and patronized by her husband to boot. Subordinated to 
her husband (and to other male relatives), many of her concerns given
little weight, embedded in a social network in which aiding other mothers as they watched and 
desperately tried to stop their children get sick and die, pregnant (5 years; I dond™ t know 
whether she nursed or not, but somebody or somebodies nursed her children for perhaps fourteen 
years), and, of course, desperate concern for doeour own little flockd! My Heart trembles with 
anxiety for themdidD

Being female in the Agrarian Age, back before the Long 20th Century, was not for sissies.

That was the life of even a powerful and privileged woman before and even well through the middle 
of the Long 20th Century.

2. Women & Market-Economy Work

2.1. Before 1900: Whenever society allowed women out of the narrow motherhood-and-domestic-handmaid 
role, women took advantage. We see this in Massachusetts with the coming of the industrial 
revolution in the first half of the 1800s, and with the manufacturersd™ desire to find a workforce 
that would work reliably without requiring the wages they would have needed to pay to pull strong 
men away from their farms. The merchants and manufacturers
of Lowell settled on unmarried young women.

In 1840, in Lowell Massachusetts, unmarried young women (16-30) made up one quarter of the cityd™ s 
industrial workforce.. They were expected to attend church. The mills would doenot employ anyoned! 
known to be guilty of immoralitydD. But otherwise, in boom times at least, they were desperate for 
young female workers, for whom working in the Lowell mills was a way to get out from under the 
thumbs of their fathers, a way to acquire a larger
dowry, and a way to have some extra freedom to be their own boss before marriage.

They took to it like ducks to water. And when the Lowell mills went into bust in recession, they 
tried to organization themselves to share hour cutbacks and resist wage declines.

Marx and Engels were somewhat right: the market had little tolerance for high patriarchy when 
eroding it could gain them profits, and an enthusiastic but not too expensive labor force. And so 
it became patriarchy d™ s foe to a certain extent.

2.2. Womend ™s Work since 1900: In 1900 in the United States paid male workers outnumbered paid 
female workers by a margin of perhaps four to one (although census procedures undercounted the 
number of women whose work products were in fact sold on the market, and economistsa€™ procedures 
have acted to minimize the economic value of within-the-household production). By the end of the 
twentieth century the paid labor force was nearly half
female.

In 1900, the bulk of female workers in the census-counted, formally-paid segment of the labor force 
were unmarried. Some 43.5 percent of single women greater than fifteen years old were in the 
officially-counted labor forcea€”41.5 percent of white and 60.5 percent of non white women. By 
contrast, only 3.2 percent of married white women (and 26 percent of married non white women, for a 
national average of 5.6 percent) participated in the labor force. In
1920 only 4 percent of married white women around 30 worked: by 1980 nearly 60 percent of married 
white women near 30 worked. Labor force participation by married nonwhite women near 30 rose less, 
but from a higher base and to a greater level: from approximately 33 percent in 1920 to 72 percent 
by 1980.

From at least one perspective, economy-wide averages of labor force participation among women 
understated the magnitude of the social and economic changes in progress. Women born around 1920 
reached adulthood around 1940 and were sixty in 1980. The labor force participation rate of those 
who were married rose from roughly 15 percent when they were 20 to approximately 45 percent when 
they were 50. By contrast their younger sisters born around
1960 already had a 60 percent labor participation rate (among those married) when they were 
20a€”and every sign is that married womena€™ s labor force participation rises with age.

The large increase in female labor force participation in the twentieth century has not been 
accompanied by any rapid closing in the earnings or wage gap between male and female workers. 
Although various sources report substantial rises in female relative to male wages across the 
nineteenth century, and some rise in relative wages up to as late as 1930, since 1930 female wages 
have remained roughly sixty percent of male wages.

23. Sources of the Earnings Gap: One source of the failure of female relative earnings to rise 
throughout the middle years of the twentieth century is the rapid expansion in female labor force 
participation. Rapid expansion in labor force participation means that at any moment a relatively 
low share of the female labor force has high experience. Because firms pay more for experienced 
workersa€”both because experienced workers are more productive and
because the promise of regular pay increases along a well-established career track can serve as a 
powerful way to motivate employeesa€’’the relative lack of experience of female workers lowers 
their relative wage.

A second source was the relatively constant degree of occupational segregation by sex. In years 
between 1900 and 1960, roughly two-thirds of female labor force would have had to change 
occupations in order to produce the same distribution across occupations as for the male labor 
force. Occupational segregation has fallen somewhat since the end of the 1960s, but it is still the 
case that women are concentrated in a set of occupations that are relatively low-
paid.

A third source is womena€™ s failure to possess, when they go to the labor market, characteristics 
that employers value, or valued. Women back at the start of the twentieth century had little 
opportunity for formal education. And they had little opportunity to gain economically-valuable 
skills through informal education and on-the-job training as well. Women at the start of this 
century by and large were employed only in tasks that were relatively easily and
quickly learned, and in which the benefits of experience on productivity were slim. But conditional 
on these factors, Claudia Goldin estimates that the gap between what a group of women were paid at 
the start of this century and what a group of men with similar experience and education would have 
been paid is relatively small.

The path of within-the-household technological advance also worked to the benefit of the typical 
woman over 1870-2016: dishwashers, dryers, vacuum cleaners, improved chemical cleansing products, 
other electrical and natural gas appliances, and so on, especially clothes-washing machinesa€”all 
these made the tasks of keeping the household clean, ordered, and functioning much easier. 
Maintaininga nineteenth century, high-fertility household wasa much
more than fulltime job. Maintaining a late twentieth century household could become more like a 
part-time job. And so much female female labor that had been tied to full-time work within the 
household because of the backward state of household technology became a reserve that could now be 
used for other purposes.

My great-great grandmother Florence Wyman Richardson was born in 1855 in St. Louis, MO, a 
privileged scion of what then qualified as St. Louisa€™ s upper class. Unlike Abigail Smith Adams, 
she received an educationa€”but not a college degree. Unlike Abigail Smith Adams, she was not 
limited to writing private letters to her husband asking him to please a€oeRemember the 
Ladiesa€D.1882 finds her lobbying for raisingthe age of consent in Missouri,
then 12. 1908 finds her on the executive board of the St. Louis Woman's Trade Union League. 1910 
finds her, with her daughter and my great-grandmother Florence (a€ceFonniea€U) Richardson Usher, 
organizing the St. Louis Womena€™ s Suffrage League. And the systema€! responded: the 19th Womena€™ 
s Suffrage Amendment, which had first been introduced back in 1878, was ratified on August 20,1920.

In response to the declining time demands of within household work and the expanding set of outside 
opportunities, female participation in the paid labor force surged. In the United States female 
levels of formal education are now poised to soon surpass male levels.

The move of women from largely within-the-household, unpaid to largely outside-the-household, paid 
work catalyzed an increase in womena€™ s material welfare and social status. As Betty Friedan wrote 
in the early 1960s, women who sought something like equal status could find it only if they found 
a€oeidentitya€lin worka€! for which, usually, our society pays.a€D As long as women were confined 
to separate, domestic, occupations which the market did
not reward with cash, it was easy for men to denigrate and minimize their competence and 
accomplishments. As the labor requirements of running a household fell, the wide separation of 
mena€™ s from womena€™ s roles became harder to maintaina€”and with it the belief that biology 
imposed a different, lower status on the female half of the human race.

2.4. Disparate Impact: By contrast, todaya€”and for most of the past half-centurya€”the gap between 
what women are paid and what men are paid are typically due less to differences in womena€™ s and 
mena€™ s experience, education, and other job-relevant characteristics than to what is apparently 
wage discrimination: simply paying women less than men. Goldin traces the emergence of such wage 
discrimination to the development of the large modern
firm with its personnel department. Before the development of the large, bureaucratic firm the 
market provided substantial insulation against discrimination to women. Before there were personnel 
policies, the labor market was relatively close to a spot market in which one could change jobs at 
will suffering little penalty: thus should any one firm begin to discriminated”to pay women less 
for the same work than mena€”women would have the opportunity to
vote with their feet for some other, less- or non-discriminatory employer.

By contrast, as Goldin writes, once firms had established personnel departments with centralized 
human resource policies:

Wages, hours, benefits, and the other components of the earnings package were no longer just part 
of the market-clearing mechanism of the labor market. They were the means by which workers were 
bonded to firms, and were used to sort workers by ability or quit propensity, and to elicit 
appropriate effort by different types of workersa€!. Firms found ti profitable to have occupational 
laddersa€L [F]irms often used sex as a sign of
shorter expected job tenured!. By segregating workers by sex into two jobs ladders (and some 
dead-end positions) firms may have been better able to use the effort-inducing and 
ability-revealing mechanisms of the wage structured!

In other words, if you do not expect the typical woman to remain on the job for long enough to 
value the regular wage increases that come with good efficiency reports and loyalty to the firm, it 
is a waste of money to reward the atypical woman who does remain on the job with such increases in 
pay.

This is not to say that all discrimination against women in wagesd”past or presentd”has a rationale 
in terms of the policies of a profit-maximizing firm. Groups of male workers fearing competition 
from an expanded supply of workers had an incentive to try to bar women from their occupation. And 
there is prejudice: on the part of male workers, employers, and customers.

3. The Long Road to Modern Feminism

3.1. Modern Feminismd™s Late Arrival: From todayd™ s perspective, the most surprising thing about 
the economic transformation of womend™ s role was how very long it took. The birth rate had fallen 
to its post-World War II average level by the 1920s. A large clerical and retail sector in which 
physical strength was completely irrelevant had emerged by the early years of this century. And 
female education had taken hold in the United States even
before the twenteith century began. Yet barriers to womend™ s employment proved pervasive and 
powerful up until the last years of the twentieth century: hours of work that assumed that workers 
worked full-time posedd”and still posed’’difficulties; discrimination that was pervasive until the 
last few decades of the century; sociological pressures that held that certain occupations were 
inappropriate for women; firm personnel policies that not just restricted
but prohibited the employment of married women.

3.2. Was There a Logic to Male Supremacy?: Why male supremacy so firmly established itself back in 
the Agrarian Age is something that is not obvious to me. Yes, it was very important to have 
surviving descendants. The pressure at all levels of society was immense: Queen Anne I Stuart 
(1665a€“1714), the last British monarch of the Stuart dynasty, was pregnant eighteen times: eight 
miscarriages, five stillbirths, George (who lived only minutes), Mary
(premature: lived only two hours), Anne Sophia (who lived only nine months), Mary (died of smallpox 
before she would have turned two), and William (died at 11 of strep throat). Anne survived all 
eighteen pregnancies. Many of her fellow-queens were not so lucky. Of the 45 queens and female 
heirs-apparent of England from the Norman Conquest through Victoria, seven died in childbed: 15.5%, 
more than one in seven, among the most cosseted and best-
nourished women in England. In the horrible run from Isabelle de Valois in 1409 through Anne Hyde 
in 1671, six of twenty died in childbed. The last to die in childbed was Crown Princess Charlotte 
Augusta of Wales in 1817.

Yes, attaining a reasonable chance of having surviving descendants to take care of one in onea€™ s 
old age meant that the typical woman spent 20 years eating for two: pregnant and breastfeeding. 
Yes, eating for two is an enormous energy drain, especially in populations near subsistence. Yes, 
Agrarian Age populations were near subsistence^”my great-grandmother Eleanor Lawton Cartera€™ s 
maxim was a€cehave a baby, lose a tootha€D as the child-to-be
leached calcium out of the mother to build her or his own bones. And she was an upper-class 
Bostonian, born in the mid-1870s. Yes, breastfeeding kept women very close to their children, and 
impelled a concentration of female labor on activities that made that easy: gardening and other 
forms of within-and-near-the-dwelling labor, especially textiles. Yes, there were benefits to men 
as a group from oppressing womenaC’’especially if women could be convinced
that they deserved it:

Unto the woman he said, a€~I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou 
shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband; and he shall rule over theea€™ 
a€!

But surely even in the Agrarian Age a shift to a society with less male supremacy would have been a 
positive-sum change? Women as equal participants in society, rather than just chattels, classified 
as a little bit above slaves and cattle, can do a lot. Wea€”optimistica€’’economists have a strong 
bias toward believing that people in groups will find ways to become, collectively, more productive 
and then to distribute the fruits of higher productivity in a way that
makes such a more productive social order sustainable.

But apparently not.

33. High Polygyny: Gross gender inequality in the age human societies that flourished between -5000 
and -2000 is literally inscribed in our genes.

It is an elementary fact of our genetics that there is a small proportion of our genomea€”the 
mitochondrial DNA genomea€”that we inherit only from our mothers. Thus we can trace descent back 
through the exclusively female line, and by looking at the amount of mutations and genetic 
divergence in a human population today in that portion of the genome, determine the effective 
female population size of the human race back in the past all the way back to
mitochondrial Eve: the woman who is the mother's mother's mother's... mother's mother's mother of 
us all.

And it is an elementary fact of our genetics that there is a small proportion of every male's 
genomea€”the y-chromosome genomea€”that we inherit only from our fathers. Thus we can trace descent 
of males back through the exclusively male line, and by looking at the amount of mutations and 
genetic divergence in a human population today in that portion of the genome, determine the 
effective male population size of the human race back in the past all the way
back to y-chromosome Adam: the father who is our father's father's father's... father's father's 
father of us all.

When we do this, we find something going on between the years -5000 and -2000 according to our 
calendar.

Those who study the evolution of the genome see rough balance in the survival of mitochondrial and 
Y chromosomal lineages up to -5000. They see rough balance in the survival of mitochondrial and Y 
chromosomal lineages since -2000. But from -5000 to -2000, however, they see 15 female 
mitochondrial lineages survive for every single male Y chromosomal lineage that survives.

The effective female population size becomes much much much much larger than the effective male 
population size, and then they resume the rough equality that they had had before the year -5000 
and since the year -2000. But in between, well, the overwhelming bulk of women are having daughters 
who have daughters... whose daughters' daughters' daughters are among us. A smaller percentage of 
men are. Only a small proportion of men breed, and then their
sons breed and their sons breed, so that the chain is such that their sons'... son's sons are us.

This would seem to mean that -5000 to -2000 saw substantial polygyny for a few men, and 
non-reproduction for others. It also means the inheritance of male reproductive advantage: that if 
your great-grandfather had the resources to have more than one wife, the odds were higher that you 
were at the top of the inequality pyramid and had the resources to have more than one wife as well. 
Patriarchal reproductive inequality was in that age both substantial and
inherited.

This is high polygyny: one man, many wivesa€”and lots of men with no wives and little sexual access 
to women. This is the Biblical Patriarch Jacob: 13 children with two wives and two concubines. 
Jacob and Leah's children were Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah Issachar, Zebulun, and Dina; Jacob and 
Rachel's children were Joseph and Benjamin; Jacob and Zilpah's children were Gad and Asher, and 
Jacob and Bilhah's children were Dan and Naphtali. And
somewhere in the neighborhood there were three mena€”unnameda€”who were without wives, and without 
children. Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah's mitochondrial DNA lineages were passed down. The three 
nameless men's y-chromosome lineages were not: only Jacob's was.

Maintaining polygyny for a number of generations requires great social pressure and great societal 
inequality among men. It also requires a great deal of subservience among women. Back in the age 
-5000 to -2000, women were, to a substantial degree, property: the property of their fathers, and 
then of those in the patriarchal polygynous network who gained control over them. And back in the 
age -5000 to -2000, a great many men were without resourcesa€s for
the overwhelming majority of men would, if they had resources to deploy to attain any form of 
social power, would have chosen to use those resources to marry. And yet many of them could not do 
so.

This age of super-patriarchy stands out in our genetic record. The social structures and 
institutions to support it are not there before -5000 and do not persist since -2000.
What was human life and human inequality like back in this patriarchal age? What brought it on? 
What made it come to an end?

What was life like for women in those 3000 years?

3.4. Gender Inequality in the Agrarian Age: Even after the end of the age of high polygyny, gender 
inequality was fierce and vicious.

A good deal of it was the result of the fact that humanity in the agrarian age found itself under 
the Malthusian hammer: because our technology was good enough for us to dominate nature, only 
disease and near-starvation kept our numbers in check.
The disease burdena€”and the fact about human biology that we are very close to the edge, trading 
off in evolutionary terms bigger brain sizes against difficulties in childbirtha€”meant that being 
female before modern medicine was not for sissies.

Consider the queens of England in the generations from Henry IV to Victoria. There were 32 queen in 
those years. Five of thema€’’Catherine Parr, Jane Seymour, Elizabeth of York, Mary de Bohun, and 
leta€™ s throw in Victoriaa€™ s cousin and more senior in the succession, Crown Princess 
Charlottea€”died in childbed. This is a 16% childbed mortality rate for the most cosseted women in 
England. There was, back in the agrarian age, a 2% chance that each
baby you had would kill youa€”and an extra 1% chance that you would be carried off while caring for 
that child when he or she suffered from the diseases that made infant mortality so high.

This Malthusian era biological load greatly constrained typical womena€™ s lives. And men took 
great advantage.

Moreover, there was an energy burden. Growing a baby is hard, energy intensive work. Nursing a baby 
is hard, energy intensive work as well. The typical agrarian age woman spent perhaps 20 years 
eating for two. And that was a substantial energy drain.
Moreover, the fact that we are mammals meant that whatever other activities a mother with young 
children undertook, they could not take her too far from the still-nursing for too long.

Hence womena€™ s work became textiles, gardening, cooking, in home production where the task has 
stable state, so you can lay it down at any time and pick it up again half an hour later without 
degradation of the job.

Even today our societies have not figured out how to balance the mammalian special role of women 
with gender equality in careers. Even in a place like Denmark, women who have been mothers have a 
7% lower employment probability, conditional on being employed they work 7% fewer hours for pay, 
and conditional on being employed and on their hours they receive 7% less per hour of work.

4. Demography as the Trigger

4.1. From Nine to Two Typical Pregnancies: The bio-demographic underpinnings of the cultural 
pattern of high male supremacy had begun to erode even before 1870. But it was over 1870-2016 that 
these underpinnings dissolved utterly. Reductions in infant mortality, the advancing average age of 
marriage, and the increasing costs of child raising together drove a decrease in fertility.

Before, limitations in artificial birth-control technology and the human drive to make love had 
biased female humans toward high fertility. Moreover, biological pressures were reinforced by 
sociological ones. Ancestor-respecting cultures gave disrespect to the dead who did not have living 
descendants to honor them. Nearly all cultures predicated any degree of social power 
whena€”ifa€”one was aged to the existence of onea€™ s living descendants. Those with
no living descendants could, usually without any sociological penalty, be left to fend for 
themselves and eventually starve. Or elderly women could be burned as witches.

In a world under the Malthusian hammer, only AM of even late-stage pregnancies will deliver a live 
birth, and only A16 or so of infants will survive to age 5. Thereafter mortality drops severely: 
a..of those alive at age five will survive to adulthood, and (including the effects of early death) 
they will then average AM of a fully extended reproductive cycle. That means that if you want to 
have an average of two of your children survive to reproduce fully, you
need to start nine visible pregnancies. Moreover, the number of children who survive to adulthood 
nearly follows a Poisson distribution: even with nine visible pregnancies, there is a fifteen 
percent chance that you will fail to have grandchildren survive to adulthood.

There were countervailing sociological pressures. Institutions that enforce a latea€”mid- or 
late-twentiesa€”start to full sexual activity lead to better Malthusian equilibria with higher 
standards of living, better nutrition, less horrific infant and early childhood mortality, and less 
of a biological childbearing load on the typical woman. The drop in mortality came first. There 
came a human population explosion.
But with the coming of well-nourished industrial society, of public health with is very sharp 
decline in infant mortality, and of effective artificial means of birth control that childbearing 
truly became a free choice rather than a biologically or sociologically imposed near-necessity.

The consequences were major. After exploding in the Industrial Age, rate of population growth in 
the industrial core slowed drastically. The population explosion turned out to be a relatively 
short run thing. And so human population growth went from an approximate doubling each generation 
to a rate approximately consistent with zero long-run population growth in the advanced industrial 
economies, with the rest of the world now following along behind. I
world that had had perhaps 750 million people in 1800,1.1 billion in 1870, and 7.4 billion in 2016 
now appears headed for a stable population of about 9.5 billion come 2050.

The number of years the typical woman spent eating for two fell from twentya€”if she survived her 
childbeda€”down to four, as better sanitation, much better nutrition, and more knowledge about 
disease made many pregnancies less necessary for leaving surviving descendants, and as birth 
control technology made it easier to plan families. And, after exploding in the Industrial Age, 
rate of population growth in the industrial core slowed drastically. The
population explosion turned out to be a relatively short run thing. Human population growth rapidly 
headed for zero long-run population growth.

The demographic transition drops typical pregnancies from eight to two. Birth control allows for 
planning when to have children. Literacy gives women knowledge. The underlying ideology of equality 
makes demands for womena€™ s suffrage, and expanded womena€™ s roles, hard to resist: the tree of 
Jefferson yields unsuspected fruit.

That feminism came late to the initially-poorer regions of the world has been a major cause of the 
Long 20th Centurya€™ s global divergence in living standards and productivity levels. It was not 
the most important cause: the most important cause was communist central planninga€’’Vladimir 
Lenina€™ s belief that one should run an entire economy by generalizing what he saw and guessed 
about German mobilization for World War I was not the brightest
light on the tree of humanitya€™ s good ideas. It was not the second most important cause: that was 
the slowness with which modern industrial technologies were diffused around the world. But that 
feminism came late, and so the demographic transition came late, to the poorer regions of the world 
was the third most important cause: the demographic burdens placed on poor countries by the 
continued population explosion were heavya€”but they are now
ebbing, as we now see the demographic transition to not just extended lifespan but to low fertility 
finish its spread around the globe.

4.2. Where Are We Going?: You can perhaps wonder about where all this is going: in todaya€™ s 
America, it appears that women are expected to do well more than half the childcare, all of the 
childbearing, all of the nursing, most of the housework, and still have equal careers in paid 
employment outside the home. Are these expectations simply another twist on patriarchy? To what 
extent are they consistent with womena€™ s being at the door of the realm of
freedom?


This would seem to mean that -5000 to -2000 saw substantial polygyny for a few men, and 
non-reproduction for others. It also means the inheritance of male reproductive advantage: that if 
your great-grandfather had the resources to have more than one wife, the odds were higher that you 
were at the top of the inequality pyramid and had the resources to have more than one wife as well. 
Patriarchal reproductive inequality was in that age both substantial and
inherited.

This is high polygyny: one man, many wivesa€”and lots of men with no wives and little sexual access 
to women. This is the Biblical Patriarch Jacob: 13 children with two wives and two concubines. 
Jacob and Leah's children were Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah Issachar, Zebulun, and Dina; Jacob and 
Rachel's children were Joseph and Benjamin; Jacob and Zilpah's children were Gad and Asher, and 
Jacob and Bilhah's children were Dan and Naphtali. And
somewhere in the neighborhood there were three mena€”unnameda€”who were without wives, and without 
children. Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah's mitochondrial DNA lineages were passed down. The three 
nameless men's y-chromosome lineages were not: only Jacob's was.

Maintaining polygyny for a number of generations requires great social pressure and great societal 
inequality among men. It also requires a great deal of subservience among women. Back in the age 
-5000 to -2000, women were, to a substantial degree, property: the property of their fathers, and 
then of those in the patriarchal polygynous network who gained control over them. And back in the 
age -5000 to -2000, a great many men were without resourcesa€s for
the overwhelming majority of men would, if they had resources to deploy to attain any form of 
social power, would have chosen to use those resources to marry. And yet many of them could not do 
so.

This age of super-patriarchy stands out in our genetic record. The social structures and 
institutions to support it are not there before -5000 and do not persist since -2000.
What was human life and human inequality like back in this patriarchal age? What brought it on? 
What made it come to an end?

What was life like for women in those 3000 years?

3.4. Gender Inequality in the Agrarian Age: Even after the end of the age of high polygyny, gender 
inequality was fierce and vicious.

A good deal of it was the result of the fact that humanity in the agrarian age found itself under 
the Malthusian hammer: because our technology was good enough for us to dominate nature, only 
disease and near-starvation kept our numbers in check.
The disease burdena€”and the fact about human biology that we are very close to the edge, trading 
off in evolutionary terms bigger brain sizes against difficulties in childbirtha€”meant that being 
female before modern medicine was not for sissies.

Consider the queens of England in the generations from Henry IV to Victoria. There were 32 queen in 
those years. Five of thema€’’Catherine Parr, Jane Seymour, Elizabeth of York, Mary de Bohun, and 
leta€™ s throw in Victoriaa€™ s cousin and more senior in the succession, Crown Princess 
Charlottea€”died in childbed. This is a 16% childbed mortality rate for the most cosseted women in 
England. There was, back in the agrarian age, a 2% chance that each
baby you had would kill youa€”and an extra 1% chance that you would be carried off while caring for 
that child when he or she suffered from the diseases that made infant mortality so high.

This Malthusian era biological load greatly constrained typical womena€™ s lives. And men took 
great advantage.

Moreover, there was an energy burden. Growing a baby is hard, energy intensive work. Nursing a baby 
is hard, energy intensive work as well. The typical agrarian age woman spent perhaps 20 years 
eating for two. And that was a substantial energy drain.
Moreover, the fact that we are mammals meant that whatever other activities a mother with young 
children undertook, they could not take her too far from the still-nursing for too long.

Hence womena€™ s work became textiles, gardening, cooking, in home production where the task has 
stable state, so you can lay it down at any time and pick it up again half an hour later without 
degradation of the job.

Even today our societies have not figured out how to balance the mammalian special role of women 
with gender equality in careers. Even in a place like Denmark, women who have been mothers have a 
7% lower employment probability, conditional on being employed they work 7% fewer hours for pay, 
and conditional on being employed and on their hours they receive 7% less per hour of work.

4. Demography as the Trigger

4.1. From Nine to Two Typical Pregnancies: The bio-demographic underpinnings of the cultural 
pattern of high male supremacy had begun to erode even before 1870. But it was over 1870-2016 that 
these underpinnings dissolved utterly. Reductions in infant mortality, the advancing average age of 
marriage, and the increasing costs of child raising together drove a decrease in fertility.

Before, limitations in artificial birth-control technology and the human drive to make love had 
biased female humans toward high fertility. Moreover, biological pressures were reinforced by 
sociological ones. Ancestor-respecting cultures gave disrespect to the dead who did not have living 
descendants to honor them. Nearly all cultures predicated any degree of social power 
whena€”ifa€”one was aged to the existence of onea€™ s living descendants. Those with
no living descendants could, usually without any sociological penalty, be left to fend for 
themselves and eventually starve. Or elderly women could be burned as witches.

In a world under the Malthusian hammer, only AM of even late-stage pregnancies will deliver a live 
birth, and only AM or so of infants will survive to age 5. Thereafter mortality drops severely: 
a..of those alive at age five will survive to adulthood, and (including the effects of early death) 
they will then average AM of a fully extended reproductive cycle. That means that if you want to 
have an average of two of your children survive to reproduce fully, you
need to start nine visible pregnancies. Moreover, the number of children who survive to adulthood 
nearly follows a Poisson distribution: even with nine visible pregnancies, there is a fifteen 
percent chance that you will fail to have grandchildren survive to adulthood.

There were countervailing sociological pressures. Institutions that enforce a latea€”mid- or 
late-twentiesa€”start to full sexual activity lead to better Malthusian equilibria with higher 
standards of living, better nutrition, less horrific infant and early childhood mortality, and less 
of a biological childbearing load on the typical woman. The drop in mortality came first. There 
came a human population explosion.
But with the coming of well-nourished industrial society, of public health with is very sharp 
decline in infant mortality, and of effective artificial means of birth control that childbearing 
truly became a free choice rather than a biologically or sociologically imposed near-necessity.

The consequences were major. After exploding in the Industrial Age, rate of population growth in 
the industrial core slowed drastically. The population explosion turned out to be a relatively 
short run thing. And so human population growth went from an approximate doubling each generation 
to a rate approximately consistent with zero long-run population growth in the advanced industrial 
economies, with the rest of the world now following along behind. I
world that had had perhaps 750 million people in 1800,1.1 billion in 1870, and 7.4 billion in 2016 
now appears headed for a stable population of about 9.5 billion come 2050.

The number of years the typical woman spent eating for two fell from twentya€”if she survived her 
childbeda€”down to four, as better sanitation, much better nutrition, and more knowledge about 
disease made many pregnancies less necessary for leaving surviving descendants, and as birth 
control technology made it easier to plan families. And, after exploding in the Industrial Age, 
rate of population growth in the industrial core slowed drastically. The
population explosion turned out to be a relatively short run thing. Human population growth rapidly 
headed for zero long-run population growth.

The demographic transition drops typical pregnancies from eight to two. Birth control allows for 
planning when to have children. Literacy gives women knowledge. The underlying ideology of equality 
makes demands for womenaC™ s suffrage, and expanded womena€™ s roles, hard to resist: the tree of

employment outside the home. Are these expectations simply another twist on patriarchy? To what 
extent are they consistent with womena€™ s being at the door of the realm of
freedom?

Institutions and practices derived under the assumption that the overwhelming bulk of the labor 
force is male, attached to employment full-time over the long term, and has minimal child care and 
household-maintenance responsibilities held back progress toward something like full economic 
equality between men and women. Nothing like full equality has yet been established. Male wages and 
earnings still appeared higher than female wages and earnings by
more than could be easily accounted for by differences in education, training, and degree of labor 
force attachment. There is still substantial discrimination visible, especially in the form of a 
a€oebreak in labor force participationa€D penalty. Today in Denmarka€”one of the most gender-equal 
countries in the world, mothers have a 7%-point lower chance of being employed, work an average of 
7% fewer hours conditional on being employed, and receive an
average of 7% less in compensation conditional on being employed and on working their hours.

In my intellectual discipline, economics, and in my labor market status group, tenured professors, 
we are now grappling with one of these institutions and practices: that, in the word of my friend 
and teacher ex-Harvard President Larry Summers, people deciding whether you are going to receive 
tenure expect that candidate professors in their 20s and 30s have a€oenear total commitments to 
their worka€! a large number of hours in the officea€! a flexibility of
schedules to respond to contingencya€! a continuity of effort through the life cycle, anda€! the 
mind is always working on the problems that are in the joba€D. This is, Larry said, not a problem 
that can be solved by talking about how we are all people of goodwill here, singing "Kumbayah", and 
offering free childcare. Requiring such a near-total commitment work spurt up through onea€™ s 30s 
does not fit easily or well with female parenthood. The response
of universities was to give mothers extra timea€”extra years to prepare their portfolios for the 
tenure review. And then gender equality seemed to demand that universities give 
fathersa€”especially those who would certify that they had been primary caregiversa€’’extra years 
on their tenure clocks as well. First-world problem, I know. But a powerful indicator that gender 
inequality shadows the life of every single woman and girl on this planet.

The effect of this facially-neutral pro-parent policy? It appears to have been that men whose wives 
gave birth and so got extra time on their tenure clocks saw their chances of getting academic 
tenure increase by 20% . Women who gave birth and so got extra time on their tenure clocks saw 
their chances of getting academic tenure decrease by 20%. The men had spent the extra time writing 
more articles. The women had spent the extra time eating for two under
the heavy biological load of mammalian motherhood.

In America, the wage gap between full-time women and men has gone from 67% in 1979 to 25% today. 
The share of women seeking paying outside-the-home jobs has gone from 30% to 60%. The gap between 
mena€™ s and womena€™ s labor force participation rates has gone from 55%-points to 10%-points.
Moreover, the current female wage gap is primarily a paid-work-interruption childbearing gap. Women 
without interruptions in their employment career earn almost as much as men. American women are now 
receiving educational credentials at a greater rate than men.

We would not say, as far as gender and its roles are concerned, that inclusion has progressed to 
the point where things are fair. We are not even sure what a€oefaira€n would mean here, exactly.
But there has been enormous progress in treating people as beings of equal significance.

I see the centrality of the economic and the extraordinary upward leap in prosperity as the 
principal news that the future will remember from the history of the Long 20th Century, and the 
coming of feminism as one ofa€”a very important one ofa€”its ramifications. But I am male. If I 
were female, would I see the demographic transitiona€”the shift of the typical womana€™ s 
experience from one of eating for two for twenty years (and of having one chance in
seven of dying in childbed) to eating for two for four yearsa€”and the rise of feminism as the 
biggest news?

Quite possibly.
