You probably didn't know that when you said "it is probably bad that lying about the 2020 election 
being stolen is a prerequisite to be in the Republican congressional leadership" you were actually 
proposing marriage to Liz
Cheney but I don't make the rules

@HistorysMost @HistoryofPersia In what sense was it a "mistake"? It definitely accomplished what 
Pinochet and company wanted accomplished, no? And there were no significant costs to the regime, 
right?

Yes!! I've been thinking this too. Highly recommend reading @BaldwinRE's Globotics Upheaval for a 
view of how revolutionary this could be for white-collar work (—> amazing possibilities for 
emerging economies,
possibly huge disruption for industrialized economies) https://t.co/ITAX8iRwZU

@RadioFreeTom @JayPako What form will war take over the next three decades? I understand rural 
guerrilla war. I understand limited war (Korea). I understand total industrial war (WWII). I 
understand the levee en masse
(Civil War). I understand bayonet & scimitar, musket & pike. But what is war now?

Paragraphs:

Minxin Pei: China: TotalitarianismdC™ s Long Shadow. a€~Rapid economic growth in China over the 
last four decades has failed to bring about democratization. Instead of undergoing evolutionary 
liberalization, the
Leninist party-state has in recent years reverted to a form of neo-Stalinist rule. Chinaa€™ s 
experience may appear to contradict modernization theory, which links economic development with 
democracy. A closer look at this
experience, however, shows that democratizing a post-totalitarian regime is far more difficult than 
democratizing an authoritarian regime because post-totalitarian regimes, such as the one dominated 
by the Chinese
Communist   Party, possess far greater capacity and resources to resist and neutralize the 
liberalizing effects of modernization. However, the medium-term success of these regimes may only 
ensure their eventual demise
through revolution. The socioeconomic transformation of societies under post-totalitarian rule 
empowers social forces and greatly increase the odds of revolutionary change when these regimes 
undergo liberalization, as
shown   in the former Soviet bloca€!

Scott Lemieux: Retweets Are Not Endorsements, but Positive Comments About the Isolated Actions of 
Otherwise Bad Conservative Politicians Are Proposals of Marriage: a€~Prticularly ridiculousa€! Jack 
Shafer has a
column entitled a€oeHow Democrats Learned to Love the Cheneysa€Da€!. a€oeJust listen to the 
ridiculous lionizing. a€~Liz CheneyaC™ s Profile in Couragea€™ said the headline of an April 28 
Charlie Sykes piece in the
Bulwark. a€~She Kind of Reminds You of Margaret Thatcher,a€™ one Republican member of Congress told 
POLITICOa€™ s Alex Thompson late last year. a€~How Liz Cheney Became the Conscience of

Republicans ,a€™ CNNa€™ s Chris Cillizza wrote in mid-January. a€~Did Liz Cheney Risk Everything to 
Impeach Trump?a€™ Cillizza asked later that month. a€~Liz Cheney Praised for Impeachment 
a€~Couragea€™
but Risks Pro-Trump Ire,a€™ the Financial Times, late January. a€™ Liz Cheney Speaks Out After 
Failed GOP Effort to Oust Her from Leadership for Impeachment Vote,a€™ People, February. a€~Liz 
Cheney is a hero for
standing up for the truth,a€™ insisted Representative Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), during impeachment 
proceedings. And so on.a€D So, to summarize: Conservativea€! Charlie Sykes. A Republican member of 
Congressa€!.

Walking punchline and man who wrote several dozen stories about Hillary Clintona€™ s EMAILS! before 
the first Democratic primary debate in 2015 Chris Cillizza. Trotskyist newsletter The Financial

Times. Peoplemagazine. Anda€! finally one actual Democratic congressman, praising her specific 
actions during an impeachment hearing. This is truly pathetic stuffa€’’transparently dumb 
guilt-by-association arguments that
can only identify one actual example of even association^! a master class in how to be a hacka€!

MichA"le A. Flournoy: How to Transform the Pentagon for a Competitive Era: a€~For almost a decade, 
U.S. defense officials have deemed the return of great-power competition to be the most 
consequential challenge to

U.S. national securitya€!. The Pentagona€™ s own war games reportedly show that current force plans 
would leave the military unable to deter and defeat Chinese aggression in the future. The Defense 
Departmental™ s
leadership, accordingly, must take much bigger and bolder steps to maintain the United Statesa€™ 
military and technological edge over great-power competitors. Otherwise, the U.S. military risks 
losing that edge within a
decade, with profound and unsettling implications for the United States, for its allies and 
partners, and for the world .a€!
