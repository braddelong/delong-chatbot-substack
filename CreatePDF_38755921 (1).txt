• Hexapodia!

• Drop the embargo now!

•  There is nothing that enables an authoritarian rA©gimea€”or, indeed, pretty much any type of

• For the Cuban military-bureaucratic junta-oligarchy, that implacable external enemy consists of 
the Cuban exiles in Miami and their descendants

2008 July - In an effort to boost Cuba's lagging food production and reduce dependence on food 
imports, the government relaxes restrictions on the amount of land available to private farmers.

2008 September - Hurricanes Gustav and Ike inflict worst storm damage in Cuba's recorded history, 
with 200,000 left homeless and their crops destroyed.
2008 October - State oil company says estimated 20bn barrels in offshore fields, being double 
previous estimates.

2008 November - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev visits. Two countries conclude new trade and 
economic accords in sign of strengthening relations. Raul Castro pays reciprocal visit to Russia in 
January 2009. Chinese President Hu Jintao visits to sign trade and investment accords, including 
agreements to continue buying Cuban nickel and sugar.
2008 December - Russian warships visit Havana for first time since end of Cold War. Government says 
2008 most difficult year for economy since collapse of Soviet Union. Growth nearly halved to 4.3%.

2009 March - Two leading figures from Fidel era, Cabinet Secretary Carlos Lage and Foreign Minister 
Felipe Perez Roque, resign after admitting "errors". First government reshuffle since resignation 
of Fidel Castro. US Congress votes to lift Bush Administration restrictions on Cuban-Americans 
visiting Havana and sending back money.

2010 July - President Castro agrees to free 52 dissidents under a deal brokered by the Church and 
Spain. Several go into exile.

2010 September - Radical plans for massive government job cuts to revive the economy. Analysts see

he had received death threats. The government abolishes the requirement for citizens to buy

Alexa van Sickle (2014): Viva la RevoluciA3n: Cuban Farmers Re-Gain Control Over Land: a€~As the 
state loosens its grip on food production, Cuban farmers and independent co-operatives will need 
support to help solve the countrya€™ s agriculture crisis: Last year, Cuba spent over $1.6bn 
(A£lbn) on food importsa€! 60% of its domestic food requirement^!. Since 2007, President Raul 
Castro, noting its connection with national security, has made food
security a priority. State farms hold over 70% of Cubaa€™ s agricultural land; about 6.7m hectares. 
In 2007,45% of this land was sitting idle. In 2008 Castro allowed private farmers and co-operatives 
to lease unused land with decentralised decision-making, and loosened regulations on farmers 
selling directly to consumers. Since 2010, Cubans with small garden plots, and small farmers, have 
been allowed to sell produce directly to consumers. However,
agriculture in Cuba remains in crisis. A government report issued in July 2013 showed that 
productivity had not increaseda€!

Marianne Ward and John Devereux (2010): The Road Not Taken: Pre-Revolutionary Cuban Living 
Standards in Comparative Perspective: a€~All indications are that Cuba was once a prosperous 
middle-income economy. On the eve of the revolution, we find that incomes were fifty to sixty 
percent of European levels. They were among the highest in Latin America at about thirty percent of 
the US. In relative terms, however, Cuba was richer earlier on. The
crude income comparisons that are possible suggest that income per capita during the 1920a€™ s was 
in striking distance of Western Europe and the Southern States of the US. After the revolution, 
Cuba has slipped down the world income distribution. As best we can tell, current levels of income 
per capita are below their pre-revolutionary peaksa€!

Carlos Eire: RaA°l Castro Leaving Power Wona€™ t Bring Change to Cuba Anytime Soon: a€~RaA°l Castro 
is relinquishing all power on the eve of his 90th birthday. It would be a mistake to think that 
this piece of kabuki theater will bring change to Cuba any time soona€!. The Communist Party in 
Cuba, which has had total control of the island for over 60 years, is not about to relax its grip. 
And since this party is controlled by the Revolutionary Armed
Forces, Cuba is really governed by an old-fashioned Latin American military junta. It is an unusual 
junta, full of former rebels, but it is a juntaa€!.

RaA°l Castro is stepping down from the throne, so to speak, but he will keep casting a long shadow 
as long as he can. Moreover, plenty of generals and colonels remain, ranging in age from their 50s 
to 80s. A top member of that exclusive circle is RaA°la€™ s son, Col. Alejandro Castro EspAn, who 
is only 55 and runs the countrya€™ s dreaded secret police. Official posts outside of the armed 
forces have a cosmetic sheen to them. The prime example is
President Miguel DAaz-Canela€!. Raw power resides in men such as Alejandro Castro EspAn and 
60-year-old Gen. Luis Alberto RodrAguez LA3pez-Callejas, ex-husband of Raula€™ s daughter Deborah. 
A member of the Castro dynasty by marriage, he is one of the most powerful men in Cuba, totally in 
charge of the branch of the Revolutionary Armed Forces that runs most of Cubaa€™ s tourist 
industry. Since tourism is the countrya€™ s main source of
income, his clout is considerable. The two brothers-in-law are purported to be engaged in a fierce 
struggle behind the scenes for the throne vacated by RaA°la€!..

Anew constitution in 2019a€!. Many articles outlaw dissent, such as No. 4: a€oeThe socialist system 
that this Constitution supports is irrevocable. Citizens have the right to combat through any 
means, including armed combata€! against any that intends to topple the political, social, and 
economic order established by this Constitution .a€Da€! Article 229 seeks to drive a nail in the 
coffin of hope: a€oeln no case will the pronouncements be reformed regarding
the irrevocability of the socialism system established in Article 4.a€da€!

What will happen next? Is it possible that among the younger Cuban communists a Gorbachev lurks?a€! 
Is it possible that the junta could be overthrown, somehow, in traditional Latin fashion?

Carmelo Mesa-Lago (2019): Therea€™ s Only One Way Out for Cubad€™ s Dismal Economy: a€~The 
islanda€™ s economy is neither efficient nor competitive. To move forward it must deepen and 
accelerate reforms. The market socialism model could provide a waya€!.. For the past 60 years, Cuba 
has been unable to finance its imports with its own exports and generate appropriate, sustainable 
growth without substantial aid and subsidies from a foreign
nation. This is the longstanding legacy of Cubaa€™ s socialist economya€!. Between 1960 and 1990, 
the Soviet Union gave Cuba $65 billion (triple the total amount of aid that President John 
Kennedya€™ s Alliance for Progress gave Latin America). At its peak in 2012, Venezuelan aid, 
subsidies and investment amounted to $14 billion, or close to 12 percent of the gross domestic 
product. And yet, despite the staggering foreign aid subsidies it has received, the
economya€™ s performance has been dismala€!. Industrial, mining and sugar production are well below 
1989 levels, and the production of 11 out of 13 key agricultural and fishing products has declined. 
Cuba is now facing its worst economic crisis since the 1990s.

Tourism has been a bright spot for Cuba. From 2007 to 2017, visitors to the island doubled, largely 
thanks to the arrival of more Americans, whose numbers grew considerably after President Barack 
Obama eased diplomatic relations in 2015. But Hurricane Irma and the tightening of travel 
restrictions by President Trump (like barring American tourists from using hotels and restaurants 
run by Cubaa€™ s military) and the alert declared by the administration after
the sonic attacks on United States diplomats in Havana led to a drop in tourism during the end of 
2017 and the first half of 2018. Tourism rebounded in September, driven by a cruise industry that 
offers customers lodging, meals and tours. Those visitors spend about 14 percent of what those 
arriving by air spenda€!.

Cubaa€™ s woes are a result of the inefficient economic model of centralized planning, state 
enterprises and agricultural collectivization its leaders have pursued despite the failure of these 
models worldwide. In his decade in power, President RaA°l Castro tried to face his brother Fidela€™ 
s legacy of economic disaster head on by enacting a series of market-oriented economic structural 
reforms. He also opened the door to foreign investment, but so far, the
amount materialized has been one-fifth of the goal set by the leadership for sustainable 
developmental. The pace of reforms has been slow and subject to many restrictions, disincentives 
and taxes that have impeded the advance of the private economy and desperately needed growth. It is 
time to abandon this failed model and shift to a more successful one as in China and Vietnama€!.

Poor agricultural production, the result of collectivized agriculture, causes the island to spend 
$1.5 billion a year on food imports. As part of his agrarian reform, Mr. Castro began leasing 
fallow state-owned land to farmers through 10-year contractsa€”now increased to 20 yearsa€”that may 
be canceled or renewed depending on the farms performance. Farmers must sell most of their crops to 
the government at prices set by the state, which are below market
pricesa€!. If reform is carried out and foreign investors are allowed to hire and pay a full salary 
directly to their employees, there will be a significant improvement in the economy and the 
government can undertake the desperately needed monetary unification that will attract more 
investment and eliminate the economic distortions that plague the economy.
