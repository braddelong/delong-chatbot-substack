I say: Jonathan Sperbera€™s The Age of Interconnection : A Global History of the Second Half of the 
Twentieth Century is a truly brilliant, gripping, and readable history of the
1945-2001 world, making a very persuasive case that globalization is the main thread for economics, 
politics, and sociology in moving toward not utopia but at least a world in
which a smaller proportion of us are in dire want and desperate fear.

Other blurbs as well:

"Jonathan Sperber has provided the first genuinely global history of the late twentieth century. It 
is a work of massive intelligence and erudition, beautifully
rendered in eloquent and moving prose. Sperber really shows how interconnections work, and how 
apparently unrelated trends or events fit in with each
other.  A must-read for anyone interested in global order, and in the precarious legacy the 
twentieth century left for the new millennium." - Harold James,
author The War of Words: A Glossary of Globalization

"A preeminent historian of the nineteenth century has turned his attention to the second half of 
the twentieth, with spectacular results. Jonathan Sperber
tackles the largest and most important themes head-on, with intellectual energy and a remarkable 
command of telling detail. The Age of Interconnection is
bold, original, imaginatively organized, and exceptionally well written. This is a deeply serious 
book that is also exciting to read, a true tour deforce." -
