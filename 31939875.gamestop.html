<p></p><p></p><p><strong>Matt Levine</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Will WallStreetBets Face SEC Scrutiny After GameStop Rally?</em>: ‘Of course the&nbsp;chart of GameStop Corp.’s stock price from yesterday is nuts. It closed on Friday at $65.01, opened yesterday at $96.73, got as high as $159.18 and as low as $61.13, and closed at $76.79. Almost 178 million shares traded, worth almost $17 billion. GameStop’s 10-day realized volatility is 308%. I am typing these words before the market opens on Tuesday, but&nbsp;by the time I send them the stock will have been trading for hours, and I am sure that it will have touched $4 and $4,000 and every number in between. It seems meaningless to talk about the price of GameStop stock, as though a single number could represent such an elusive concept. GameStop stock has all the prices at once. Maybe the craziest thing in the chart is not the wild spikes up and down, but the flat lulls when no one was trading because the stock exchange wouldn’t let them. “The stock surged as much as 145% to $159.18 on Monday,” reports Bloomberg News,&nbsp;“triggering at least nine trading halts”… LINK:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-26/will-wallstreetbets-face-sec-scrutiny-after-gamestop-rally">https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-26/will-wallstreetbets-face-sec-scrutiny-after-gamestop-rally</a></p><p></p><p><strong>Ciara Linnane &amp; Tomi Kilgore</strong>:&nbsp;<em>It isn’t just GameStop: Here are some of the other heavily shorted stocks shooting higher</em>: ‘Suffering theater chain, fallen cellphone giant and another damaged retailer are among shorted stocks finding big gains on Wall Street… LINK:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-some-of-the-other-stocks-seeing-gamestop-like-short-squeezes-11611687693">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-some-of-the-other-stocks-seeing-gamestop-like-short-squeezes-11611687693</a></p><p></p><p><strong>Michael Hiltzik</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Trade the GameStop short squeeze if you wish, but it’s very stupid</em>: ‘The online traders have decided to stage a massive assault on short sellers by driving up the share price of a money-losing retailer of video games and consoles named GameStop…. GameStop shares were trading in the $2-to-$4 range as recently as April. As I write, they’re at $132 and change, up more than 60% on the day. They’re up about 505% this year already. This action has produced massive losses among short sellers, who thought GameStop was an OK stock to short a year ago. Among the biggest losers is the hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which is headed by a very well-known Wall Street star. Melvin’s reported losses on GameStop and other misplayed short bets forced it to seek a nearly $3-billion bailout from two other hedge funds this week. On the Reddit forum WallStreetBets and among other small investors posting online, the glee is palpable… LINK:&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-trade-gamestop-short-squeeze-204857842.html">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-trade-gamestop-short-squeeze-204857842.html</a></p><p><strong>Katherine Burton &amp; Hema Parmar</strong>: _How Reddit r/wallstreetbets Traders Squeezed Gamestop (GME) Short Melvin Capital: ’An online crowd targets a hedge fund star and inflicts losses. But Steve Cohen and Ken Griffin are betting he will prevail. The first sign of trouble for hedge fund wunderkind Gabe Plotkin came in late October: A poster on Reddit’s popular wallstreetbets forum was taking aim at his wildly successful investment firm. “GME Squeeze and the demise of Melvin Capital,” wrote the user, Stonksflyingup, referring to stock ticker of GameStop Corp. and Plotkin’s $12.5 billion firm. Before long, veryforestgreen weighed in: “Melvin Capital New Short Attack.” Then, greekgod1990: “Melvin vs WSB! And GME to the moon.” So it was that… a hedge fund star suddenly found himself at the mercy of the day-trading Reddit bros who have become one of the most powerful, if improbable, forces in the stock market today. The attack on Plotkin’s six-year-old Melvin Capital shifted the balance of power in ways that would have seemed unimaginable only months ago. By Wednesday, the firm had capitulated to the amateurs and covered the GameStop short. The explosive growth in retail day-trading, powered by platforms like the Robinhood trading app and forums like wallstreetbets, has turned the old order on its head. Melvin Capital’s mistake, if it can be called that, was leaving footprints behind in the marketplace. Reddit users were able to identify stocks that Melvin was wagering against and then buy those en masse, unleashing a violent run-up in prices that turned Melvin’s winning bet into a loser…. A classic $50 short can lose multiples that amount if the stock soars. And while using options may limit losses, investors can get wiped out quickly if the stock rises. The shorts that were listed in Melvin’s regulatory filing from the third quarter all rocketed in recent weeks. Names include Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc., iRobot Corp. and GSX Techedu Inc. GameStop, the stock that seemed to set off the short squeeze, soared 634% in the month through Tuesday and an additional 31% in post-market trading after Elon Musk tweeted a link to the Reddit thread with the caption “Gamestonk!!”… Until this year, Plotkin, 42, had one of the best track records among hedge fund stock pickers. He’d worked for Cohen for eight years and had been one of his biggest money makers before leaving to form Melvin—named after his grandfather—in December 2014…. Why they singled out Melvin remains a mystery. As far as hedge fund managers go, Plotkin is considered low key…. Investors have been expressing faith that Plotkin will climb out of this hole. Griffin said Monday that he and his partners “have great confidence in Gabe and his team.” Cohen called him “an exceptional investor and leader.” A person familiar with the thinking inside Plotkin’s firm said one lesson is clear: Don’t leave a trace and only buy put options over the counter. “This phenomenon of retail investors jumping on a bandwagon to dominate trading activity is a new kind of portfolio risk,” said Jay Raffaldini, global head of sales and distribution at UBS O’Connor…</p>
