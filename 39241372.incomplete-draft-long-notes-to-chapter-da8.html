Manoilescu was correct. The twentieth century is the century of corporatism. But he was wrong to think that the weak and fraudulent steps taken by fascism in the 1920s and 1930s were significant. It is only now, outside the old capitalist centers, that societies which proudly proclaim themselves marxist are building genuine corporatism…</p></blockquote><p>Chirot’s thesis is that really-existing socialism—after the age of revolutionary mobilization and then of terror-driven industrialization is finished—converges on a form that interwar fascists would have recognized as close to its ideal, a form that he calls “corporatism”.</p><div><hr></div><p>12) Vladimir Lenin, <em>Testament</em>, November 1922 &lt;http://www.historyguide.org/europe/testament.html&gt;. </p><p>The consequences of Lenin’s failure to either move Stalin out of the leadership or set forward a succession plan can be glimpsed in the poetry of <strong>Anna Akhmatova</strong>, in the introduction to her “Requiem”:</p><blockquote><p><strong>No, not under the vault of another sky, not under the shelter of other wings.
