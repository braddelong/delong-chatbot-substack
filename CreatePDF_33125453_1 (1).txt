The global container fleet today has a capacity of 32.9 million TEU (Twenty foot-Equivalent Units). 
The container ship OOCL Hong Kong has 21,000 TEUs of capacity. Back in
1582 we had perhaps 1/12 of our current population on the globe. Back in 1582, back in the days 
when the English merchant fleet was 1/20 of the worldwide total, the entire
English merchant fleet could carry only 1/3 as much cargo as the OOCL Hong Kong can.

Thus, for the globe as a whole, today 30 million TEUs; 1582 140 thousand TEUsa€”l/200 as much. That 
is one dimension of economic growth and globalization since the start of
the Imperial-Commercial Revolution Age back in the 1500s:

Yuval Noah Harari: Lessons from a Year of Covid: a€~A largely automated present-day container ship 
can carry more tons than the merchant fleet of an
entire early modern kingdom. In 1582, the English merchant fleet had a total carrying capacity of 
68,000 tons and required about 16,000 sailors. The
container ship OOCL Hong Kong, christened in 2017, can carry some 200,000 tons while requiring a 
crew of only 22a€! LINK:

Robert J. Shiller: The Godleya€ “Tobin Memorial Lecture: a€~John Maynard Keynesa€™ s (1936) concept 
of a€~animal spiritsa€™ or a€~spontaneous optimisma€™ as a
major driving force in business fluctuations was motivated in part by his and his contemporariesa€™ 
observations of human reactions to ambiguous situations where probabilities
couldna€™t be quantified. We can add that in such ambiguous situations there is evidence that 
people let contagious popular narratives and the emotions they generate influence
their economic decisions. These popular narratives are typically remote from factual bases, just 
contagious. Macroeconomic dynamic models must have a theory that is related to
models of the transmission of disease in epidemiology. We need to take the contagion of narratives 
seriously in economic modeling if we are to improve our understanding of
animal spirits and their impact on the economya€!

Brian Morrissey: Why Is This Interesting?: a€~Quartz was right about one big thing: Most articles 
are too long. Quartz co-founder Kevin Delaney put it this way to me over five
years ago: a€oeA lot of the 800-word stories have been padded out with the B matter. Ita€™ s called 
B matter because ita€™ s B grade, not A matter, which is the focal point of the
story.a€D Brevity is more important than ever. There is simply too much content let loose on the 
world these daysa€!

Wikipedia: Hedonic Treadmill: a€~Hedonic adaptation may be a more common phenomenon when dealing 
with positive events as opposed to negative onesa€!. Negative emotions
often require more attention and are generally remembered bettera€!. Adopting a€oenon-zero suma€D 
goals, those which enrich onea€™ s relationships with others and with

society as a whole (i.e. family-oriented and altruistic goals), increase the level of subjective 
well-being. Conversely, attaching importance to zero-sum life goals (career success,
wealth, and social status) will have a small but nevertheless statistically significant negative 
impact on peoplea€™ s overall subjective well-beinga€!. Contradicting set point theory,
