Six Paragraphs:

Of all the things I understand least well, it is that we dare not aim to have production hit 
potential output and thus hit the inflation target because we cannot handle even a small
overshoot becausea€! of what, exactly? This kind of thinking perhaps avoids some risk of a bumpy 
future by creating an eternal very bumpy present:

Benjamin Wallace-Wells: Larry Summers Versus the Biden Administrationa€™ s Coronavirus-Stimulus 
Plan: a€~The Biden rescue package will pour out
enough sand to fill a hole, and then keep pouring. In Summersa€™ s view, this is economically 
risky, because it means that the Federal Reserve will
probably eventually need to manage inflation, a recipe for a bumpy future. a€oeMy reading is that 
there are roughly zero historical examples where we got
inflation to the point where the Fed got nervous and had to tighten and the whole thing happened 
smoothly ,a€D Summers told me last week. He also sees
the stimulus as politically risky, in that there are only so many times the Biden Administration 
can ask Congress to spend huge amounts of money without
raising taxes to offset it, and fewer still if they spend this round inefficientlya€!

The Malthusian picture, the 1870-1914 escape, and fears that World War I had permanently deranged 
the economic growth process in such a way as to raise the specter of the return
of the Devil of Malthus:

John Maynard Keynes (1919): The Economic Consequences of the Peace: a€~ [Their] view of the 
worlda€! filled with deep-seated melancholy the
founders of our Political Economy. Before the eighteenth century mankind entertained no false 
hopes. To lay the illusions which grew popular at that
agea€™ s latter end, Malthus disclosed a Devil. For half a century all serious economical writings 
held that Devil in clear prospect. For the next half
century he was chained up and out of sight. Now perhaps [with World War I] we have loosed him 
againa€!

Ummma€l You target asset bubbles by reducing leverage, not by raising interest rates. I have a bad 
feeling about this:

Ruchir Sharma: By Targeting House Prices, New Zealand Shows the Way: a€~While consumer prices have 
been held in check by globalisation and
automation, easy money pouring out of central banks has been driving up the price of assets from 
stocks to bonds and housinga€!. A global political
celebrity,   the liberal Ardern was elected on a promise of affordable housing. Fed up, her 
government has ordered the central bank to add stabilising home
prices  to its remit, starting March 1. It is novel and healthy for a politician to recognise the 
unintended consequences of easy money. If this idea catches on,
it could lead to greater financial and social stability worldwidea€!. Arderna€™ s move may not slow 
the housing boom soon, because supply-and-demand
dynamics are too strong. But ordering the central bank to make housing price stability a higher 
priority is a start, and could inspire others to rethink the role
easy money has played in driving financial instabilitya€!

I confess hope that Facebook dies rapidly. Silicon Valley needs a very obvious and pointed lesson 
that treating your users like cattle to be exploited and misled leads to your
bankruptcy and to your permanent exclusion from all polite society. Feeding your users to the likes 
of Alex Jones for the Luz & the advertising dollars is despicable.

This applies to you to, Google, for the current state of Youtube:

Justin Bariso: Tim Cook May Have Just Ended Facebook: a€~Cook aptly points out, a€oeadvertising 
existed and thrived for decadesa€D without using
data that was collected in less than transparent ways. And as customers are offered more choice 
when it comes to how apps and websites track their data,
experts predict that more and more people will opt out of said tracking. If youa€™re an advertiser, 
youa€™ 11 need to adapt. Or die.But therea€™ s also a
bigger lesson at stake. Now is the time to ask yourself: Which philosophy do I want to pursue? Do I 
want a business that serves my customers? Or one that
takes advantage of customers to serve my business? Because in the end, only one of these 
philosophies is sustainable for the long-term. The other will lead
you to crash and burn. And while the long-term solution may initially prove more challenging, 
remember: a€oeThe path of least resistance is rarely the
path                                                                      of wisdoma€Da€!

But, Scott, the ARP is not a€oea bloated, stealth, and wholly partisan vehiclea€D. If it were, 
Republicans would be running against it rather than trumpeting its accomplishments
and hoping to make voters think they voted for rather than against it, capisce?:

Scott Lincicome: While You Were Seussing: a€~While Republicans fight the culture war on TV, 
Democrats enact progressive priorities into lawa€!.
Republicans are only now scrambling to define the ARP and are left to hope that it doesna€™ t work, 
while Democrats are on the attack. A big reason for
that    is that instead of mounting an effective messaging campaign to highlight these 
provisionsa€’’ones almost entirely unrelated to the pandemica€”and
others (such as that ridiculous union pension bailout or the $60 billion in tax hikes), and to 
define the ARP as a bloated, stealth, and wholly partisan vehicle
to achieve progressive social change under the cover of Covid, Republicans were on TV yelling about 
childrena€™ s books and cancel culturea€!

The huge gap between the performance of the biomedical establishment and the performance of the 
Trump administration is truly remarkable:


Jason Kottke: How Were the Covidd€“19 Vaccines Developed So Quickly?: a€~l. The need was urgenta€!. 
2. Funding & focus. Companies and
governments threw billions and billions of dollars at thisa€! 3. Availability of volunteers & high 
incidence of diseasea€!. 4. International & corporate
collaboration. Countries and companies shared research, data, and resourcesa€!. 5. We knew a lot 
about coronaviruses from previous worka€L 6. Scientific
and technological capabilitya€!. Humanitya€™ s general scientific and technological abilities have 
never been stronger or more powerfula€!. Bloomberg:
a€oeRemember also that technology has evolved rapidlya€”for example, wea€™ re now about able to 
sequence the genomes of every mutant version of
the     virus in less than a day. That helps in speeding up vaccine development.a€D Dr. Mark 
Toshner sums up the effort: a€oeHowever we have collectively
now shown that with money no object, some clever and highly motivated people, an unlimited pool of 
altruistic volunteers, and sensible regulators that we
can do amazing thingsa€Da€!

Why is it, anyhow, that a a€cemeasurementa€D is a self-adjoint operator? A measurement is 
entangling the quantum wave function of the experiment with that of a measuring
device that has a macro-visible pointer. What does that have to do with a self-adjoint operator?

Sydney Coleman: Quantum Mechanics in Your Face: a€~The state of a physical system at a fixed time 
is a vector in Hilbert spacea€! A±a€l. It evolves in
time according to the SchrAJdinger equation ia',N±/dt = HN±, where the Hamiltonian H is some 
self-adjoint linear operatora€!. Some, maybe all, self-
adjoint operators are a€ceobservablesa€D. If the state is an eigenstate of an observable A, with 
eigenvalue a, then we say the value of A is a, is certain to
be observed to be a.  Therea€™ s an implicit promise in here that, when you put the whole theory 
together and start calculating things, that the words

a€ceobservesa€D and a€ceobservablea€O will correspond to entities that act in the same way as those 
entities do in the language of everyday speech
under the circumstances in which the language of everyday speech is applicable. Now to show that is 
a long story. Ita€™ s not something Ia€™ m going to
focus on here, involving things like the WKB approximation and von Neumanna€™ s analysis of an 
ideal measuring device8, but I just wanted to point out
that thata€™ s therea€!
