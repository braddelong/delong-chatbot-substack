culture-war content of the document, and they may underestimate the strength of the political ground that Republicans stand on with many of those issues. But the big opportunity for Democrats… lies in a short statement about taxes: “All Americans should pay income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount”… a promise to raise taxes on well over one hundred million people…</p></blockquote><p>So why was it important to whoever wrote Rick Scott’s piece to include the word “income”, rather than simply: “No Americans should be freeloaders—all should pay taxes”?</p><p>As best as I can figure out, this meme entrenched itself as part of a process of doubling-down on Mitt Romney’s “47%” comments. For example, back in 2012, Glenn Harlan Reynolds:</p><blockquote><p>A pretty concise summary of the Obama administration's political approach: Vote for us because we'll take other people's money from them and use it to buy you stuff. Whether it's Sandra Fluke's contraceptives, Obama's "spread the wealth" response to Joe The Plumber, his 1998 plan to make welfare recipients a majority coalition or the free phone in the viral "Obamaphone" video, that's the gist of it. And it obviously works. This was the essence of Mitt Romney's worries about the 47% of Americans receiving government benefits…</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2012/10/01/taxes-romney-47-iredistribution/1604089/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2012/10/01/taxes-romney-47-iredistribution/1604089/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>But why does it remain? After all, Mitt Romney is now an Enemy of the Republican People, and no longer the standard-bearer who said something stupid who needs to be defended.</p><p>My guess as to what is going on: A huge part of the Republican Party base right now <em><strong>desperately needs to believe that they are a permanent minority in the nation</strong></em> because the Democrats have succeeded in turning the majority of people into freeloaders. Why? Because if that is not true, the flirting and more-than-flirting with authoritarianism and fascism would look to them as stupid as it is in reality.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Susan Athey</strong>: <em>Machine Learning &amp;

Confronted with the fact that all of our title to everything has dirty hands somewhere in the past, those its response was not that this poses a big problem for the view that "what we have, we hold Dash and no one can legitimately take it away from us by, for example, taxing or regulating us”, but instead took his philosophical argument as in some way a justification for taking the current distribution of property as in some sense legitimate, and thus sacred going forward.</p><p>This more than half-convinced me that the book was a joke gone wrong. This conviction that was somewhat reinforced when Nozick then used the Cambridge Rent Control Board to extort $30,000 from his landlord, Erich Segal &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030404174732/http://www.daft.com/~rab/liberty/Miscellaneous/Nozick-article">https://web.archive.org/web/20030404174732/http://www.daft.com/~rab/liberty/Miscellaneous/Nozick-article</a>&gt;. After all, if even Nozick takes his “philosophy” not as a guide as to how to walk-the-walk, but just as a game, why should any of us pay attention to him?</p><p>But Matt this morning focused on one interesting but undeveloped idea of Nozick’s—an idea that he certainly did not think was interesting enough to develop, and may have adopted simply as another way to troll left-wing academics, but that I nevertheless find interesting:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Matt Yglesias</strong>: <em>The Case for the Austro-Hungarian Empire</em>: ‘Robert Nozick… taught the seminar …“Philosophy of History: The Russian Revolution”… an effort to develop a philosophical account of historical contingency that he teases a little in his 2003 book <em>Invariances</em> but doesn’t explore at great length…. Some moments in history are causally thin.… If Alexander the Great decides to settle down earlier rather than push his armies east, hundreds of years of Indo-Greek and Greco-Bactrian culture don’t exist. Nozick, to own Marxism-influenced professors, wanted to say that the Russian Revolution was, in fact, highly contingent…. But then he wants to argue that contingent on Lenin’s victory in the Russian Civil War, the lapse into Stalinist totalitarianism is essentially inevitable…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:48557327,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-case-for-the-austro-hungarian&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:159185,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Slow Boring &quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec696af9-c7e4-4f1d-a582-6c0e5beffe69_768x768.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The case for the Austro-Hungarian Empire&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;This is a post about the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a weird subject, I know.

The second of these is “history”, or “path dependence”. The fourth of these is “expectations”. All three of these are within the purview of the economist. The third of these is “chaos”, or perhaps “narrative”. But here economists have nothing and historians have little to say other than to tell the story and analyze the conditions that made Alexander the Great matter.</p><p>I don’t think that this was what Nozick was getting it with his “thin” and “thick”.

I am not so sure. Somebody, somewhere, was going to see how large corporations and total-industrial-war militaries worked, and take that and discontent with the market to try to run a central-planning economy. That it was Lenin in Russia definitely (3). That it happened somewhere? That I think is much more likely to be (2). And <em><strong>a</strong></em> Stalin if not <em><strong>the</strong></em> Stalin? I think a Stalin is, rather, a (1), and that a Stalin in Russia is a (2).</p><p>Muscovy, after all, had a Czar in the late 1500s. It has a Czar today.</p><p></p>
