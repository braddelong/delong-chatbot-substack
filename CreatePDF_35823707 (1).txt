Zeynep Tufekci: Sunday Open Thread for Subscribers: a€~The one big part of the tragedy here is that 
we had most of the science we needed really early ona€L There was more to
learn, for sure, but the basics were there. There have been very few scientific surprisesa€! 
outside of how vaccinable this (luckily!) turned out to be (we didna€™t know partly
because we didna€™ t really try for the others exactly because we didna€™ t care). But 
sociologically, I am shaken. I knew about all of this, because I teach and study it. The

group-think, the institutional resistance and inertia, the cognitive biases, the social dynamicsa€! 
I know about them all! But Ia€™ ve been truly surprised most is how much stronger
than I thought these dynamics were, even in a crisis. Perhaps because of the crisis. Ia€™ ve 
learned a lot about viruses last year, but I did not really need that much beyond an
introductory textbook to write the policy oriented pieces Ia€™ ve published. I think we need to 
update our social science textbooks and assumptions, though. The dynamics that
have dominated our world arena€™ t novel in the sense that we were new to them, but they are 
clearly so much stronger than we usually acknowledged!

Paragraphs:

Jeet Heer: The Reactionary International: d~Sixty years agod! the Algiers putsch, a failed coup dd™ 
A©tatd! [to overthrow] President Charles de Gaulled!. On April 21,
2021, a date obviously picked to echo the events of 1961d! an open letter warning that France was 
on the verge of civil war and that military should prepare to seize powerd!
Christian Piquemal, former head of the French Foreign Legion, along with 20 retired generals, 80 
officersd!. In National Review in 1985d!. General Raoul Salan, one of the
leaders                                                                             of the 1961 
putsch. Molnar wroted! "to this day half of the French regard Saland™ s rebellion as legitimate, 
but would question de Gaulled™ s. It was de Gaulle who
tore up the unwritten law of army solidarityd!. De Gaulle himself revolted against Petaind™ s 
lawful governmentdD In other words, fascist collaboration was legitimate and

the 1961 coup plotters were more justified than de Gaulled™ s decision to join the Western allies 
in the war against Nazism. The Reactionary International, as should be clear, is a
proto-fascist movement. For the sake of democracy, itd™ s urgent that people of this orientation be 
rooted out of the military in France, the United States, and wherever else they
may be found. In late 2020 and early 2021,1 took comfort in the fact that Trump seemed to have 
limited support in the officer class of the American military. This led me to think
that for all Trumpd™ s bluster about a coup, he wouldnd™ t have the crucial military support he 
needed. I was right to the extent that the January 6 insurrection was, as The
American MindT writes, a dceshambolicdD farce. But it looks like the Trumpists are thinking about 
how a future coup might succeed. The are starting to realize that they need to
cultivate a mutinous cadre in the officer class. Thatd™ s a development pregnant with dangersd!

Ed Luce: The Rise & Rise Of Tucker Carlson Conservatism: d~His reaction to Wednesdayd™ s verdict on 
Derek Chauvin for killing George Floyd crossed even his own thinly
drawn lines. The juryd™ s triple guilty verdict, reached after 10 hours of deliberation, amounted 
to doean attack on civilisationdU, said Carlsond!. The true cause of
Floydd™   s death, Carlson has repeatedly said, was a drug overdosed’’not the nine-minute 
asphyxiation that jurors saw over and over. Carlsond™ s outburst is notable for two
reasons. First, he is the most popular conservative TV anchor in the country, with a nightly 
audience of 3m. Since Donald Trump lost his Twitter account, Carlson has become the

most influential voice of aggrieved white conservatismd!. Second, Carlsond™ s outburst illustrated 
that US racial injustice is not close to having turned the corner. Shortly before
the jurors announced their verdict, police in Columbus, Ohio, shot dead a 16-year-old black girl 
who was allegedly wielding a knife. During the trial, police shot and killed an
average of three Americans a day, the majority non-white, including a 13-year-old unarmed black 
boy. Unlike Floydd™ s death, these were not recorded on the mobile phones of
passers-by. That footage meant Chauvind™ s case was almost unique. Even then, Carlson wants viewers 
to believe that Chauvin was the real victim. As Groucho Marx might
have   asked: who should Americans believe, Tucker Carlson or their own lying eyes? For some people 
believing is seeing, rather than the other way rounda€! LINK:
