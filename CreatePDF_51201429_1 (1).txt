FIRST: Time for Another Victory Lap by the Fed (& the Biden Administration!)

A very nice, nice employment report this AM:

Colby Smith & Peter Wells: US Economy Gained 431,000jobs in March as Tight Labour Market Persists'. 
a€~Unemployment rate falls to 3.6%a€!. For every unemployed person in the US there are roughly 1.7 
openingsa€!. January and February payrolls were revised higher by a combined 95,000a€!. Average 
hourly earnings registered a 0.4 per cent monthly gain, translating to a 5.6 per cent increase from 
the same period last yeara€!.
The share of Americans either employed or looking for work has crept higher, but remains shy of 
pre-pandemic levelsa€! the labour force participation ratea€! 62.4 per cent. In February 2020, it 
stood at 63.4 per centa€!

We are leaving rubber on the road as we rejoin the highway traffic at speeda€”but that is expected, 
and, indeed, inevitable: complain about our current inflation and wish we did not have it, and you 
are wishing we were repeating the catastrophic and disastrous anemic recovery of the early 2010s:

FRED —  Consumer  Price  Index  for  All  Urban  Consumers:  All  Items  Less  Food  and
Energy in U.S. City Average

Jan 2022

And inflation expectations in the bond market remain very well anchored. And I do not see a path to 
a wage-price inflationary spiral that would be difficult and painful to resolve without, first, a 
loss of the expectational inflation anchor in the bond market:

FRED — 5-Year, 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate

0.8

2019-07           2020-01           2020-07            2021-01           2021-07            2022-01


Things that are completely missing from the discussion from the "Oh woe! Inflation is above 2%! Oh 
woe!a€Q-ers. How do they expect us to make the wheel to our goods-&-deliverator-heavier economy 
that we need to make without inflation as prices and wages rise in sectors that need to expand? How 
do they expect us to regain full employment rapidly without inflation? A short burst of inflation 
is what a rebalancing and wheeling economy does. We did it in

1948 and 1951, and the inflation passed. What is it that is going to make this time different from 
those times?

PARAGRAPHS:

To say the least, you do not see benefit-cost ratios this large very often at all. It is, I think, 
a sign of how hugely our income and wealth distribution is greatly warped away from the 
distribution that would support an economy that successfully addresses the vulnerabilities that we 
claim at least are of concern to us:

Irwin Garfinkel, Laurel Sariscsany, Elizabeth Ananat, Sophie M. Collyer, Robert Paul Hartley, Buyi 
Wang, & Christopher Wimer: The Benefits and Costs of a U.S. Child Allowance: a€~We produce core 
estimates of the benefits and costs per child and per adult of increasing household income by 
$1,000 in one year; these can be applied to value any cash or near-cash program that increases 
household income. Using
microsimulation, we then apply these estimates to determine net aggregate benefits of three child 
allowance policiesa€!. Our estimates indicate that making that expansion permanent would cost $97 
billion per year and generate social benefits with net present value of $982 billion per yeara€!

The fact that Putin has not declared victory and called for a cease-fire in an attempt to cut 
losses scares me very greatly. Launching the war was not rational, yes. But continuing the war when 
it is clear that his generals were all lying to him about their forcesa€™ capabilities is simply 
bonkers:

Zvi Mowshowitz: More Data & Peace Terms'. a€~Russia is increasingly framing this war internally as 
existential. Which is an odd thing to do while continuing to deny it is a war, forcing a kind of 
doublethink. It also has to be considered in light of Russian nuclear policy, which was affirmed as 
only to be used when the existence of the state is threatened. So then it becomes vital to 
represent that you see a threat to the existence of the
state. Russia also claiming that Hunter Biden personally financed the Pentagona€™ s Ukrainian 
biological weapons labs. Bingo, sir. Why not throw it all together? Once your claim is obviously 
false, why stop? Better to max out benefits of asserting the obviously falsea€!

But maybe in this social media flood-the-zone-with-propaganda age, Putin can maintain enough 
control over what Russian people think that there is no pressure and no reason for him to declare 
victory and bug out:

David Epstein: Why Propaganda Works (The a€oelllusory Truth Effecta€V^: a€~This coda to a New York 
Times piece about the war in Ukraine caught my eye: "Mr. Kucher, the former independent TV host, 
said he was taken aback at how often the Kremlin talking points about fighting Nazis in Ukraine 
were echoed back to him in telephone conversations with former classmates. a€~I was so stunneda€™, 
Mr. Kucher said. a€~I never
would have thought that propaganda would have such an effect on people.a€™ Your Twitter timeline 
may be filled with profile pics featuring azure and yellow flags, showing support for Ukraine, but 
(to borrow a Washington Post headline) Putin is probably still a€™ winning the information war that 
countsa€™ a€”the one at home and in China. Some of the Russian propaganda seems so transparent that 
ita€™ s hard to believe ita€™ s
effective. But propaganda works. To learn a bit about why it works, and how to combat 
misinformation in general, I called Lisa Fazio, a Vanderbilt psychologist who studies 
misinformation^!

I do not think Michael and Jennifer have got this right. That is because I do not think I know what 
"getting this right" would be. I do think they are thinking hard about the right issues. A 
university is a place to advance and test and evaluate thoughts and issues. A university is also a 
community to educate and help people growa€”a safe space, to coin a phrase:

claim to be speaking and writing on the basis of their scholarly expertise? When Gilley compares

rights protect him. But thata€™ s not the same thing as saying that his claims have the protection 
of academic freedom. He is not, after all,
platforming as an ordinary citizen; hea€™ s doing it, as he says in a tweet on June 16,2020, 
a€cebased on my knowledge of Maoa€™ s politics.a€D This is critical. For here he is saying that his

history and politics of various regimes. Hea€™ s not staking his rights to this speech on the First

SUBJECT: Detouring into What Is Now History of Economic Thought: a€ceRational Expectationsa€D 
Business-Cycle Theory

David Glasner has a question about the a€oerational expectationsa€D business-cycle theories 
developed in the 1970s:

David Glasner: Three Propagation Mechanisms in Lucas & Sargent: a€~Ia€™ma€! hop[ing for]a€! some 
guidancea€! abouta€! propagation mechanismsa€! [in] Robert Lucas and Thomas Sargent[a€~s]a€! 
a€oeAfter Keynesian Macroeconomics.a€Da€!

The critics typically conclude that the theory only attributes a very minor role to aggregate 
demand fluctuations and necessarily depends on disturbances to aggregate supplya€!. [But] even 
though the new classical theory implies that the forecast errors which are the aggregate demand 
impulses are serially uncorrelated, it is certainly logically possible that propagation mechanisms 
are at work that convert these
impulses into serially correlated movements in real variables like output and employmenta€! the 
presence of costs to firms of adjusting their stocks of capital and labor rapidlya€!. accumulation 
plans for claims on physical capital and other assets convert serially uncorrelated impulses into 
serially correlated demands for the accumulation of real assetsa€! workers who for some reason are 
without jobs find it
rational   not necessarily to take the first job offer that comes along but instead to remain 
unemployed for awhile until a better offer materializesa€!. In principle the serially uncorrelated 
process of forecasting errors can account for any proportion between zero and one of the [serially 
correlated] steady state variance of real output or employment. The argument that such models must 
necessarily attribute most of the
variance in real output and employment to variations in aggregate supply is simply wrong 
logicallya€!

My problem with the Lucas-Sargent argument is that even if the deviations from a long-run 
equilibrium path are serially correlated, shouldna€™ t those deviations be diminishing over time 
after the initial disturbance? Can these propagation mechanisms account for amplification of the

In some ways this is of only history-of-thought interest. For Lucas and Prescott, at least, had 
within five years of the writing of a€oeAfter Keynesian Macroeconomicsa€n decided that the critics 
were right: that their models of how mistaken decisions driven by serially-uncorrelated forecast 
errors could not account for the bulk of the serially correlated business-cycle variance of real 
output and employment, and they needed to shift to studying real business cycle
theory instead of price-misperceptions theory. The first problem was that time-series methods 
generated shocks that came at the wrong times to explain recessions. The second problem was that 
the propagation mechanisms did not amplify but rather damped the shock: at best they produced some 
kind of partial-adjustment process that extended the impact of a shock on real variables to N 
periods and diminished its impact in any single period to 1/N. There was
noa€! what is the word?a€!. multiplier in the system.

It was stunning to watch in real time in the early 1980s. As Paul Volcker hit the economy on the 
head with the monetary-stringency brick, repeatedly, quarter after quarter; as his serially 
correlated and hence easily anticipated policy moves had large and highly serially correlated 
effects on output; Robert Lucas and company simplya€! pretended it was not happening: that monetary 
policy was not having major effects on output and employment in the first half of
the 1980s, and that it was not the case thjat the monetary policies that were having such profound 
real impacts had no plausible interpretation as a€oesurprisesa€n leading to a€oemisperceptionsa€n. 
Meanwhile, over in the other corner, Robert Barro was claiming that he saw no break in the standard 
pattern of federal deficits from the Reagan administration^™ s combination of tax cuts plus defense 
buildup.

Those of us who were graduate students at the time watched this, and drew conclusions about the 
likelihood that Lucas, Prescott, and company had good enough judgment and close enough contact with 
reality that their proposed a€oereal business cyclea€D research program would be a productive 
onea€’’conclusions that, I think, time has proved fully correct.

Behind all this, of course, was this issue: the a€cemicrofoundationsa€D of the Lucas a€oeisland 
economya€D model were totally stupid: people are supposed to a€cemisperceivea€D relative prices 
because they know the nominal prices at which they sell but do not know the nominal prices at which 
they buy, hence people confuse a monetary shock-generated rise in the nominal price level with an 
increase in the real price of what they produce, and hence work
harder and longer and produce more? (I forget who it was who said at the time that the model seemed 
to require a family in which the husband worked and the wife went to the grocery store and the 
husband never listened to anything the wife said.) These so-called a€oemicrofoundationsa€n could 
only be rationally understood as some kind of metaphor. But what kind of metaphor? And why should 
it have any special status, and claim on our attention?

Paul Krugmana€™ s judgment on the consequences of this intellectual turn is even harsher than mine:

What made the Dark Ages dark was the fact that so much knowledge had been lost, that so much known 
to the Greeks and Romans had been forgotten by the barbarian kingdoms that followed. And thata€™ s 
what seems to have happened to macroeconomics in much of the economics profession. The knowledge 
that S=I doesna€™ t imply the Treasury viewa€”the general understanding that macroeconomics is more 
than supply and
demand plus the quantity equation a€” somehow got lost in much of the profession. Ia€™ m tempted to 
go on and say something about being overrun by barbarians in the grip of an obscurantist faitha€!

I would merely say that it has left us, over what is now two generations, with a turn to DSGE 
modelsa€’’Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium^’’that must satisfy a set of formal rhetorical 
requirements that really do not help us fit the data, and that it gave many, many people an excuse 
not to read and hence a license to remain ignorant of James Tobin.


David Glasner: Three Propagation Mechanisms in Lucas & Sargent: a€~Ia€™ma€! hop[ing for]a€! some 
guidancea€! abouta€! propagation mechanismsa€! [in] Robert Lucas and Thomas Sargent[a€~s]a€! 
a€oeAfter Keynesian Macroeconomics.a€Da€!

The critics typically conclude that the theory only attributes a very minor role to aggregate 
demand fluctuations and necessarily depends on disturbances to aggregate supplya€!. [But] even 
though the new classical theory implies that the forecast errors which are the aggregate demand 
impulses are serially uncorrelated, it is certainly logically possible that propagation mechanisms 
are at work that convert these
impulses into serially correlated movements in real variables like output and employmenta€! the 
presence of costs to firms of adjusting their stocks of capital and labor rapidlya€!. accumulation 
plans for claims on physical capital and other assets convert serially uncorrelated impulses into 
serially correlated demands for the accumulation of real assetsa€! workers who for some reason are 
without jobs find it
rational   not necessarily to take the first job offer that comes along but instead to remain 
unemployed for awhile until a better offer materializesa€!. In principle the serially uncorrelated 
process of forecasting errors can account for any proportion between zero and one of the [serially 
correlated] steady state variance of real output or employment. The argument that such models must 
necessarily attribute most of the
variance in real output and employment to variations in aggregate supply is simply wrong 
logicallya€!

My problem with the Lucas-Sargent argument is that even if the deviations from a long-run 
equilibrium path are serially correlated, shouldna€™ t those deviations be diminishing over time 
after the initial disturbance? Can these propagation mechanisms account for amplification of the 
initial disturbance before the adjustment toward the equilibrium path begins? I would gratefully 
welcome any responsesa€!
