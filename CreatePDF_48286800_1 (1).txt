I haven't had a chance to see the famous video from
Straumli Realm, except as an evocation. (My only
gateway onto the Net is very expensive.) Is it true
that humans have six legs? I wasn't sure from the

Key Insights:

1. The Federal Reserve Act directly speaks of the importance of representation^ "that Governors 
come from different economic communities with different economic interests, and not be limited to 
monetary economists, financiers and bankers, and rich asset-heavy worthies. The African-American 
communitya€”and, indeed, the gloal warming-worrying community a€’’are fine communities to be 
represented by a Governor.

2. A former senior advisor to the Secretary of the T reasury for development and finance, a former 
senior economist at the Council of Economic Advisors who served as the point person on the European 
side of the Great Recessiona€™ s financial crisis, a tenured economics professor from a major state 
university in the Midwest and a former National Fellow at the Hoover Institutional" there would be 
no Republican senatorial opposition to her from
other than the ten wingnuttiest wingnuts were Lisa Cook not Black.

3. Wea€”at least Brada€”is thus more scared than he was about the Republican-conservative white 
racial panic that this backlash reveals: 400 years of guilt from the enforcement of white supremacy 
have led at least the people who speak for the Republican Party to fear a former Hoover Institution 
National Fellow as a mortal threat by reason of what they presume is her hyper-wokeness.

4. If Lisa Cook does not satisfy that Republican community, I cannot think of a single 
African-American who could.

5. We are in an era of unrest, in which people are stupid and very stupid things happen. This white 
backlash against Lisa Cook is just one of the many very, very stupid things happening at the 
moment.

6. This moment will pass: 10 years ago Lisa Cooka€™ s nomination would not have generated a 
backlash; 10 years from now it would not generate a backlash.

7. At this moment in America our competence as a nation to do even the very simple things is 
heavily compromised by the racialized hyper-politicization of nearly every single thing.

8. Hexapodia!

Olivier Blanchard @ojblanchardl

To avoid that silence may be misinterpreted: I like Lisa Cook and believe she will be a very useful 
addition to the Board. Monetary policy has important implications for inequality. Having an 
inequality expert as part of the Board is highly desirable.
