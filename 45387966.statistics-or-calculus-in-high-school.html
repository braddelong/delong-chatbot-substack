If you sort kids into different math tracks based on their test scores, that might reveal that Black and Latino kids are doing worse than white and Asian ones. If you refuse to sort, you can pretend you’ve achieved equality. But will you provide useful education?… Lizzy Hull Barnes, who is in charge of San Francisco math education, saying it’s invalid to look at test outcomes to see whether kids are doing better or worse: “In high school they take the test one time in 11th grade…. It’s difficult to use that as a measurement for success in all of mathematics.” I 100% understand that lots of perfectly normal parents and students got test fatigue in the heyday of No Child Left Behind and that there is such a thing as too much assessment. But the authors of the proposed framework are trying to push the state’s schools in a strange new direction with almost no valid research they can cite to indicate that it’s likely to work. It’s particularly egregious because while California schools do exhibit a racial achievement gap, their results are sub-par across the board. They should be trying to imitate other, better-performing states, not inventing a whole new way of doing high school math…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:45221732,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.slowboring.com/p/californias-math-detracking-initiative&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:159185,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Slow Boring &quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec696af9-c7e4-4f1d-a582-6c0e5beffe69_768x768.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;California’s math detracking initiative seems pretty misguided&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;California is considering adopting a new Mathematics Framework for its K-12 public schools.

I am told that Carl Friedrich Gauss strongly believed that it <em><strong>must</strong></em> hold because otherwise taking-averages and least-squares would not be the right things to do, and no God could be so cruel as to inflict such non-rightness on his mathematicians.</p><p>We, today, however, do not rest our confidence in taking-averages and least-squares procedures on a Benevolent Providence. We rest it on the Central Limit Theorem and the convergence-in-distribution of a sum of independent random variables to a Gaussian distribution if Jari Waldemar Lindeberg’s Condition &lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindeberg%27s_condition">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindeberg%27s_condition</a>&gt; is satisfied. What is Lindeberg’s condition? That each individual random variable in the sum be sufficiently small compared to the total.</p><p>In all this, knowing calculus—in the sense of having it in your intellectual panoply—is very useful for getting from Lindeberg’s Condition to the Central Limit Theorem. Knowing calculus is very useful in getting from the Gaussian distribution to the optimality of taking-averages and least-squares. If calculus is part of your intellectual panoply, you have in your mind a mental structure that makes sense and provides a rationale for standard statistical procedures. If you took calculus once, long ago, you have in your mind… a vague memory… that tells you that the formulas did not come out of nowhere, or, rather, did not come out of nowhere if you jiggered the problem and chose your assumptions carefully so that the formulas do come out of them.</p><p>And here’s the crux: in the real world of using statistics, where your sample is finite, where one or a few of the disturbances are large relative to the total, where your sample is non-random, where your observations are not independent, the Central Limit and Gauss-Markov theorems are of little use. Yes, taking averages and least-squares fits are the first things you should do. But then you should not down tools, because calculus! Then you should do other things and see if they agree with taking-averages and least-squares. And if they do not you should think hard about the problem.</p><p>Statistics is, IMHO, better taught as if you are teaching engineers rather than mathematicians. And I think that California is probably right in wanting to put engineering-focused statistics before calculus in the sequence.</p><p>But somebody should try it. And then we should assess how well it works, through tests and follow-up studies, and see.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/statistics-or-calculus-in-high-school?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/statistics-or-calculus-in-high-school?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Ancient Athens 3D</strong>: <em>A Tour of Classical Athens (5th Century BC)</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulAxMLJ7O7M&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulAxMLJ7O7M&amp;t=1s</a>&gt; &lt;</p><div id="youtube2-ulAxMLJ7O7M" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;ulAxMLJ7O7M&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;1s&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ulAxMLJ7O7M?start=1s&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Ben Thompson</strong>: <em>Intel vs. TSMC, How Samsung and TSMC Won, MAD Chips</em>: ‘Globalization generally, and chips specifically, are a sort of weapon of mutually assured economic destruction… more comforting than you might expect when considered systematically… &lt;<a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/intel-vs-tsmc-how-samsung-and-tsmc-won-mad-chips/">https://stratechery.com/2021/intel-vs-tsmc-how-samsung-and-tsmc-won-mad-chips/</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Barry Ritholtz</strong>: <em>Business Not As Usual: Foundations of ESG</em>: ‘Robert Schwartz and Robert Zevin were Wall Street curiosities.

It opens in 1860 with the landing in Sicily of forces intent on unifying Italy and ends in 1910, when a priest comes to assess the reliquaries of the prince’s now aged spinster daughters. In between, it recounts the fortunes of the prince’s favorite nephew, Tancredi, who supports the unification efforts of Giuseppe Garibaldi more out of opportunism than idealism and eventually becomes a diplomat. Tancredi’s career is made possible only by his marrying money—which inevitably means marrying down. To the horror of his aunt, the devastation of a cousin who loves him and the wry comprehension of his uncle, Tancredi falls in love with Angelica, the beautiful daughter of an upwardly mobile landed peasant father and an illiterate mother….

The theological convictions of Christian conservatism were put to a profound stress test, and the convictions failed. Partisanship prevailed. Populism prevailed. In some ways, the South prevailed…. I’m old enough to remember the words and expressed beliefs of even some of the most enthusiastic Trumpist Evangelicals before they supported Trump, and this much I know: If I’d told them in December 2014 that white Evangelicals would shortly vote in overwhelming numbers for a thrice-married man who bragged about grabbing women by their genitals, appeared in a Playboy movie, paid hush money to cover up an affair with a porn star, and was facing multiple corroborated claims of sexual harassment and sexual assault, they’d say that only Democrats were that hypocritical. Then, if I followed that up by saying that a disproportionate number of that same Evangelical community would shun pre-vaccine mask-wearing and social distancing in the midst of a deadly pandemic that would claim hundreds of thousands of American lives and then disproportionately reject life-saving vaccines, they’d think I was an anti-Christian bigot. If I capped off my prophecy by noting that white Evangelicals would be far more likely than virtually any other American community to embrace wild election conspiracy theories and then a subset of that community would literally storm the Capitol with prayers on their lips, then their assessment of me would be clinched. They’d think I’d simply lost my mind.&nbsp;But that’s where we are.
