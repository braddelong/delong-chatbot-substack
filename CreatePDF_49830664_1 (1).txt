First: Monetary & Fiscal Policy in a Low-Interest Rate Economy

Paul Krugman has some interesting musings on these issues: Paul Krugman: Credible Irresponsibility 
Revisited <https://stonecenter.gc.cuny.edu/credible-irresponsibilitv-revisited/>. And Olivier 
Blanchard: Fiscal Policy Under Low Interest Rates 
<https://fiscal-policv-under-low-interest-rates.pubpub.org/>a€!
Leta€™ s rewind the tape:

Ever since the late 1820s, When John Stuart Mill was writing Essays on Some Unsettled Questions in 
Political Economy, it has been at least moderately clear that the task of a central bank in normal 
times is to adjust the money supply to money demand, so as to make Saya€™ s Law true in the 
practice even though
it is false in theorya€”to avoid either the general glut that is the flipside of an excess demand 
for or the inflationary inability to purchase at expected prices that is the flipside of an excess 
supply of money.

In the neo-Wicksellian language that was re-introduced to economic-policy debates in the mid-1990s 
by Alan Greenspan, this requires the central bank to match the market real interest rate r to the 
a€oeneutrala€oe real interest rate r*. But what if the market nominal rate is at the zero lower 
bound, yet the real rate is
still above the neutral rate? As Paul Krugman wrote last week:

An economy that remains depressed even at zero interest rates a€~wantsa€™ expected inflation. With 
flexible prices it will get there by deflating now so that it can inflate later. But why put [a 
sticky-price economy] through that wringer? Far bettera€! to givea€! the inflation without the
deflation, by promising that the central bank will do whatever it takes to assurea€! inflationa€! 
high enough to get r down to r*.a€D

That is what a central bank will do if it is following the rule of trying to make Saya€™ s Law true 
in practice. That is how it can get prices and incentives as close as possible to those in a 
flex-price well-functioning macroeconomy, given the stickinesses of wages, prices, and debt 
contracts that we have. And so that
inflation is not a disturbance of the optimal macroeconomic market allocation, but rather an 
instantiation of it.

Yet, Krugman notes, nobody has listened to him. Instead of talking about how when the central bank 
hits the zero lower bound it should then generate the inflation that an optimal flex-price economy 
would deliver, a€oeinsteada€! the discussion is abouta€! deficit spendinga€!. Why? One reason is 
a€oethe dead
hand of conventional wisdom.a€D But, Paul Krugman says, there are a€oereal arguments for keeping 
the inflation target low if you can still achieve full employment.a€D (I would stress that if.)

What are those real arguments? I see two: (1) a stable unit-of-account yardstick is genuinely 
useful for contracting purposes, and (2) conserving on cognitive resources is helpful for 
behavioral reasons.

But does this mean one should definitely resort to fiscal policy instead? It is not obvious. The 
way the argument usually goes, using expansionary fiscal policy instead of expected inflation to 
unwedge an economy with high unemployment stuck at the zero lower bound has huge dangers and 
drawbacks on its own. It
leads to excessive debt accumulation which requires high entrepreneurship-destroying taxes to 
amortize. It crowds out productive private investment as well. It is thus a two-fold drag on 
long-run economic growth. Plus there is the risk of cracking the governments™ s status as a 
provider of safe assets, with
resulting risks of financial crisis and national bankruptcy.

But, Larry Summers and I argued back in 2012, this argument via appeal to excessive fear of public 
debt is simply incoherent when the economy is at its zero lower bound, for in a low interest-rate 
economy the difficulties of financing the national debta€”and thus whatever drag on growth is 
generated by debt
accumulationa€”are not increased but rather decreased by successful expansionary debt-financed 
fiscal policy. And how about the drag from the crowding-out of private investment? As Paul wrote:

When interest ratesa€! are below the economya€™ s growth ratea€! the economy shouldna€™ t 
accumulate [more] capitals!. [With] a distinction between the interest rate onS! a safe asset, 
andS! higher rates of return on private investments! the appropriate r in the r-g comparison is
somewhere between [safe and risky]S!. What matters isS! the rate of return on those forms of 
investment that would be stimulated by negative real interest ratesS!. Cho[osing] to pursue higher 
public spending at the expense of lower private investments! mainlyS! substituting
government expenditure for residential investments!

And, I would add, substituting government expenditure for dissipative griftsS”for low interest 
rates induce organizations that are not well-setup to judge risks to take risks in reaching for 
yield, and one of the oldest tricks in the financial book is to make money by inducing your 
counterparty to take on risks that
they do not understand.

As I see it, the question of which ra€”a risk-free safe asset or a risky one, and, if risky, how 
riskya€’’should be compared to the economya€™ s growth rate g is a subtle one, and it hinges on 
where in the economy the risk premium comes from. In our economies, the financial-asset risk 
premium does not come from
risk aversion induced by a declining marginal utility of wealth: it is simply ludicrous to pretend 
that it is so or, if it is so, it is because of an astonishing failure to mobilize societya€™ s 
true risk-bearing capacity that must be due to other, major financial market failures. What are 
they?

It has always seemed to me that the presumption is that risk-bearing and investment-judging 
capacity does not combine with capital in fixed proportions, and that a world with less investment 
is one in which investment projects use more of risk-bearing and investment-judging resources. Thus 
my belief is that the
right r to use in the g>r comparison has to be very very close to the risk-free rate.

What about when things change, and when you exit the g>r rA©gime? It has always seemed to me that 
the costs and risks of such are lowa€’’governments, after all, have enormous powers of financial 
regulation to ultimately boost demand for their debt, if they wish, providing that the government 
can tax enough to
keep the debt position fundamentally sound in the long run.

But these are a€oeactive research issuesa€D.

Paragraphs:

Thomas Piketty: A Brief History of Equality. a€~A short but sweeping and surprisingly optimistic 
history of human progress toward equality despite crises, disasters, and backsliding. A perfect 
introduction to the ideas developed in his monumental earlier booksa€!. Piketty guides us with 
elegance and concision
through the great movements that have made the modern world for better and worse: the growth of 
capitalism, revolutions, imperialism, slavery, wars, and the building of the welfare state. Ita€™ s 
a history of violence and social struggle, punctuated by regression and disaster. But through it 
all, Piketty shows,
human societies have moved fitfully toward a more just distribution of income and assets, a 
reduction of racial and gender inequalities, and greater access to health care, education, and the 
rights of citizenship. Our rough march forward is political and ideological, an endless fight 
against injustice. To keep moving,
Piketty argues, we need to learn and commit to what works, to institutional, legal, social, fiscal, 
and educational systems that can make equality a lasting reality a€!

Martin Wolf: Rishi Sunak Owes Britain More than Warmed-Over Thatcherism'. a€~Politicians with 
Thatcherite leanings need to dig deeper to understand why performance has been so mediocre. Many of 
them emphasise the need for a a€oelower tax economya€D, Sunak among them. But the evidence suggests
this is quite unimportant, however much the self-interested wealthy insist upon the opposite. 
According to the IMF, among these 15 countries, the UKa€™ s tax burden is third from the lowest. If 
high taxes crippled prosperity, the UK should be among the richest. It is not. Finland, Belgium, 
Austria, Sweden,
Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway all have substantially higher tax burdens and higher 
GDP per head. So, when Sunak states that a€oel firmly believe in lower taxesa€D, he is just 
uttering ideology. That ideology has costs. The UKa€™ s distribution of household disposable income 
is much the most
unequal of these 15 countries, according to the OECD. Moreover, this was also the result of the 
shifts in the 1980s, which have never been reversed. In assessing the record, one also cannot 
ignore the financial crisis and subsequent austerity, both of which were outcomes of the 
Thatcherite ideologya€!

corrupt grain .a€Ua€! A household-level field experimental in Lagosa€! to test whether exposure to 
five different messages about (anti)corruption influence the outcome of a a€oebribery game.a€D We 
find that
exposure to anticorruption messages largely fails to discourage the decision to bribea€!. The 
effect of anticorruption messaging is conditioned by an individuals™ s preexisting perceptions 
regarding the prevalence of corruption.a€D I like this abstract: It argues for the relevance of the 
work without making
implausible claims. Maybe part of this is that their message is essentially negatives!
