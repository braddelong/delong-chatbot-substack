Ezra Klein & Larry Summers: I Keep Hoping Larry Summers Is Wrong. What ifHea€™ s Not?’. a€™ For the 
last year or so, Larry Summers, the economist and former Treasury Secretary, has been this 
relentless, loud, frustrating economic Cassandraa€!.

Larry Summers: The situation continues to resemble the 1970s, Ezraa€! mistakes of excessive demand 
expansion that created an inflationary environment. And then we caught really terrible luck with 
bad supply shocks from OPEC, bad supply shocks from elsewhere. And it all added up to a 
macroeconomic mess. And in
many ways, thata€™ s the right analogy for now. Just as L.B.J.a€~s guns and butter created 
excessive and dangerous inflationary pressure, the macroeconomic over-expansion of 2021 created 
those problems, and then layered on with something entirely separate, in terms of the further 
supply shocks wea€™ ve seen in oil and in
food. And so now I think wea€™ ve got a real problem of high underlying inflation that I dona€™t 
think will come down to anything like acceptable levels of its own accord. And so very difficult 
dilemmasa€!. I dona€™t envy the tasks that the Fed has before ita€!. The job of the demand 
managers, principally the Fed, is to
judge what supply is and calibrate appropriately. Ita€™ s not an excuse for inflation to blame it 
on supply. Ita€™ s a realitya€! that you have to deal with.

Larry Summers: The first academic papers that I wrote as a late graduate student in the 1970s were 
about the benefits of high pressure labor marketsa€!. At that time a 1 percent increase in the 
employment ratio for white males went with a 6 percent increase in the employment ratio for 
African-American teenagers. And I
highlighted that much of unemployment was not just frictional unemployment but was long-term 
structural unemployment that destroyed families. And so it was terribly, terribly important to 
avoid recessionsa€!

Larry Summers: What we care about is not just the level of employment this year, but the level of 
employment averaged over the next 10 yearsa€! not just about wages and opportunities this year, but 
we care about wages and opportunities over the long-terma€!. The doctor who prescribes you 
painkillers that make you feel
good to which you become addicted is generous and compassionate, but ultimately is very damaginga€!

Larry Summers: The excessively inflationary policies of the 1970s were, in a political sense, what 
brought Ronald Reagan and brought Margaret Thatcher to powera€!

Larry Summers: I [do] not care about inflation for its own sake. But what I [do] care about [is] 
real wage growth over time, average levels of employment and opportunity over time, and a sense of 
social trust that would permit progressive policies. And I thought those vital endswere being 
compromised by those withgood
intentions but a reluctance to do calculations. And I have to say that the early evidence at this 
pointa€! it gives me no pleasure to say thisa€! suggests that those fears may, to an important 
extent, have been justifieda€!

Larry Summers: The near-term impact is $25 or $30 a barrel higher oil prices, and the equivalent 
with respect to grainsa€! a meaningful contributor to the inflation process, perhaps a 1 and a half 
percentage pointsa€!. Things take longer than you think they will and thenthey happen faster than  
you thought theycould.And so
I suspect that relief is going to be slower in terms of supply chains than people expect. But I do 
think that at some point, it will come in the future. And then all of this is going to make the 
task of containing inflation that much more difficulta€!

Larry Summers: If you look at five-year expected inflation right now, it is about 3 and a half 
percent, detached from the 2 percent target. And if you look at 10-year expected inflation, it is 
at close to 3 percent. So we actually are a bit detached from our target levels of inflationa€!. 
The Fed has done more signaling of
tightening in the last two months than any time in the last 40 years. So the only reason why we 
have kept inflation expectations under control is that belatedly the Fed has done the things that 
those of us who are anxious about inflation were recommending for the past nine monthsa€!. But 
leta€™ s not confuse massive Fed
signalinga€!. Leta€™ s not say that expectations have become anchored and thata€™ s some kind of 
triumph for team transitory. Thata€™ s evidence on the efficacy of the recommendations of those of 
us who felt that the Fed should have begun the tightening much soonera€!

Larry Summers: To restrain the economy, you have to raise the level of real interest ratesa€!. I 
dona€™ t think wea€™re going toa€!bring down the rate of inflation until we get to positive real 
interest ratesa€! [nominal] ratesa€! 4 percent to 5 percenta€! over the next couple of yearsa€!. I 
think the likelihood is that we will
not return to 2 percent inflation without having at least a mild recessiona€!

Larry Summers: I endorsed Build Back Better. I re-endorsed Build Back Better. I was a strong 
supporter of Build Back Better for exactly the reason you say that I think there are a set of 
fundamental investments that we need to make in our economy that start from infrastructure and 
include a range of human investments.
There are ways in which I think the design could be better. Ia€™ d like to see emphasis on 
efficiency and building infrastructure as well as more money into infrastructure^!. We should pay 
for fundamental public investments that are worth it, that there are a lot of fundamental public 
investments that are worth it, that have
very high returns. That many of the ways of raising revenue probably would be good ideas even if we 
didna€™ t need the money, such as improving tax compliance^ I

Larry Summers: If we could find a way to admit substantially more, particularly, but not only, 
high-skilled immigrants into the countrya€! the benefits in terms of growth would really be very 
substantiala€!. Finding a better synthesis on immigration policy that allowed more immigration and 
probably involved more insistence
on the Americanization of immigrants woulda€! bea€! very desirablea€!

Larry Summers: We as a country have under-invested substantially in place-based policies. I think 
that we have red hot markets in some placesa€I. And we have rather stone cold markets in a variety 
of other places. And I dona€™ t think wea€™ ve applied enough imagination about how we could shift 
demand from the red
hot places to the stone cold placesa€!

Larry Summers: We are under-investing in technologya€! way under-spending on fundamental 
researcha€! shortchanging one of our most fundamental strengths as a countrya€!

Larry Summers: I was very influenced by Zachary Cartera€™ s recent biography of Keynes, which I 
think demonstrates that ideas and even economic models ultimately, and over time, have larger 
impacts than maneuvers and machinations in small roomsa€!

Larry Summers: A book that will come out in the next several months, Brad DeLonga€™ s Slouching 
Towards Utopia 
<https://www.amazon.com/Slouching-Towards-Utopia-Economic-Twentieth-ebook/dp/B09PL63Ll V>a€! is, I 
think, a really remarkable and powerful placing of all of economic history in perspective, that
gives a sense that at some level I had known but never appreciated of how profoundly different the 
20th century was than all other centuries and points towards the combined power of science and 
markets to change the world profoundly, and sometimes, in some ways, for good, and sometimes, in 
some ways, for ill. I think
anybody who wants to propound about economic policy should read that booka€!

Ezra Klein: I feel like Ia€™ ve been waiting for Brada€™ s big economic history opus for a long 
time now. So I will agree that Ia€™ m very excited for that one to hit my deska€!
