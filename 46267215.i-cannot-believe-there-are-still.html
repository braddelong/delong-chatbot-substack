There was worse wrong with economists who stayed on the Trump train once it became clear what he was—“the only thing the Republican Party accomplished in two years with control of Congress was a big tax cut," as Oren Cass, who had hoped for much more put it. And Cass then got off the train.</p><p>Parenthetically, it was a very badly designed tax cut. It is hard to produce a tax cut for capital that contains such feeble incentives for investment in new capital that it has no effect increasing investment in America.

Back in the 2010s this was all viewed as pretty noteworthy stuff, and it was huge news when Theranos’s technology turned out to be fake…. Now of course it is 2022 and we are all a bit more jaded. There was the SoftBank boom, we’ve had a couple of years of SPACs, there is so much crypto. Raising hundreds of millions of dollars from gullible investors who don’t do much due diligence is not particularly impressive anymore. If you want to do it by pretending to have a technology, you can (try electric vehicles!), but these days even that is optional…. You can raise lots of money from investors by letting them pretend to own digital pictures of apes, or by just saying “hey here’s a Ponzi”….

In the long run, rich countries produce some of everything, but they aren’t heavily weighted toward labor-intensive industries. That’s just the nature of the beast…. Which means that if we want to have American companies be at the center of those supply chains, we should do two things: Nearshoring and ally-shoring. Nearshoring means moving production from Asia to Mexico and other close-by places (especially Mexico)…. Ally-shoring… means relocating suppliers from China to countries allied or de facto allied with the U.S…. Remember, in the age of automation, manufacturing isn’t going to be our source of mass employment…. Instead, it’s most like software, a high-value industry that brings in lots of money that then gets spent locally on things like health care and restaurants and insurance and other things that create the real mass employment.

There’s going to be an increase in the number of people who want to live within a day-tripping range of where their industry is located, but not necessarily commute to the office every day. That means probably a flattening of the gradient so there’s not as much differentiation between inner-ring suburbs and further-flung ones…. What we really need to do is to improve the transit connections throughout the region…. The goal is to serve what TransitCenter calls “all-purpose” transit ridership, not just 9–5 commuters. In other words, people who live in the suburbs should find the train to be an appealing option for an occasional trip to a museum or cultural attraction in central D.C. or Baltimore…. The Savage MARC station between D.C. and Baltimore has an awesome name, but it’s surrounded by a park-and-ride lot and some generic strip mall stuff. You should be able to build tall apartments and townhouse clusters near these stations—not with the expectation that people will be living car-free but thinking that it might work for a lot of one-car households who do many day-to-day errands on foot in the manner of the 15-minute city and can also ride trains to lots of regional destinations….

It is not intuitive to me. So let me try to anchor it in a way to make it more familiar:</p><ul><li><p>If the bottom three quarters of the population were to get one quarter of the income, the top quarter to get the rest, and were income to be evenly distributed within the top quarter and the bottom three quarters, then the Gini coefficient would be 0.5.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>If the bottom two-thirds of the population were to get one-third of the income and the top third the rest, once again evenly distributed within the top third and the rest, then the Gini coefficient would be 0.33.</p></li></ul><p>Suppose that we decide to be bad philosophers: suppose that we decide to think like early 19th century British utilitarian Jeremy Bentham. Bentham believed that the obvious point of society was to maximize utility: to attain the greatest good of the greatest number. And he saw no reason why utility, or happiness, or well-being, should not with sufficient progress of a society be susceptible to objective quantitative measurement just as natural philosophers had figured out how to quantitatively measure something as subjective as heat and cold. Bentham further thought the people were pretty good judges of their own utility and were highly motivated to make choices that increased it. End it seemed much more than reasonable to Bentham to believe in diminishing marginal utility: that each doubling of the resources you could command to devote to increasing your utility would add the same amount to your well-being.</p><p>If all that were to be the case, then a move of society from a Gini of 0.5 to 0.33 would have the same effect on total societal well-being—provide the same increment to the social welfare function—as a 30% boost to everyone’s income. By such a yardstick, a reduction in the Gini from 0.5 to 0.33 would be an advance in societal well-being, and an increase from 0.33 to 0.5 a retardation, equivalent to what we get in an average 15 years of economic growth, at the pace economic growth has proceeded since 1870.</p><p>That means that shifts in inequality of the type we have seen recently are substantial. They are big deals in this particular assessment of how well our society is doing. Shifts in inequality are, however, a much smaller deal than the extraordinary rising tide of economic growth over the past 150 years which has given us 10 successive such increments. But they are not something that you want to ignore—even if you put to one side the consequences of the distribution of wealth for politics and sociology.</p><p>A few cautions: The Gini is income, not status or power: the 4 million slaves in the United States in 1860 would have objected most strongly to claims that the United States was then no more unequal than Britain. Yet that is what the Gini coefficient calculated from the income distribution shows.</p>
