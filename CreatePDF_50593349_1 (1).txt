First: Six Episodes of U.S. Inflation Above 5%/Year in the 1900s

The top graph is the CPI inflation rate; the bottom graphs are overlapping graphs of the Federal 
Reservea€™ s discount ratea€”the rate at which it lends to banks on reasonable collateral.

Counting 1974 and 1979 as two episodes, there were six times in the twentieth century during which 
the annual inflation rate got above 5%. One was the World War II inflationa€”cut off by price 
controls. Then came the post-WWII structural-rebalancing-and-pent up demand inflation, and then the 
Korean War structural-rebalancing inflation as the U.S. government wheeled its economy to fight the 
Cold War. During both the Fed sat bya€”it was then still
focused on keeping the prices of Treasury bonds high. The inflations soon passed away.

Before those came the World War I episode. That episode of inflation was cut off by an increase in 
the discount rate from 3.75%/year to 7%/year, which not only ended the inflation but enforced 
deflation: a 20% decline in the price level from its peak. (This decline, I should ask, made the 
task of restoring the gold standard at anything like pre-World War I nominal parities much more 
difficult, hence much more pointless.) Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz
judged that the rise was a€oenot only too late but also too mucha€D 
chttps://archive.org/details/monetarvhistorvo0000frie/page/230/>: the Fed should have moved earlier 
to prevent excessive bank discounts from inappropriately boosting high-powered money, and at the 
moment the Fed did move the structure of credit was sufficiently based on a continuation of Fed 
policy that the Feda€™ s move generated a€oeone of the most rapid declines [in economic
activity]                                                                                           
                                                                                                    
                  on recorda€D.

If the Federal Reserve had not moved to raise discount rates after World War I, what would have 
happened? Friedman and Schwartza€™ s judgment is that an earlier increase of, say, 125 basis points 
to remove the incentive for banks to engage in excessive discounts would have brought the excessive 
growth of the high-powered money stock to an end, and stopped the inflation.

Then came the 1970s: The Fed raised interest rates after the Yom Kippur War oil shock to control 
inflation; then, after inflation peaked, it lowered them to try to restore full employment; then 
came the year when, as the late Charlie Schultze said, a€oeour forecasts of nominal income growth 
were dead on, but inflation came in 2%-points high and real growth 2%-points lowa€D; and then came 
the Volcker disinflation, reversed in September 1982 when they
realized that they had bankrupted Mexico, and not resumed as the Fed decided to declare a fall in 
inflation to the 4-5%/year range as complete victory. That 4-5% target lasted for a decade, 
followed by the opportunistic disinflation down to and Alan Greenspana€™ s declaration of the 
2%/year inflation targeta€”a declaration that it is very hard today to argue was appropriate, given 
the extraordinary amount of time global north economies have spent with interest
rates at their zero lower bound since.

What does macroeconomic theory tell us that the Federal Reserve should do now, in the spring of 
2022?
Olivier Blanchard writes:

In early 1975, core inflation was running at 12 percent and the real policy rate was equal to about 
a"’6 percent, a gap of about 17 percent. Today, core inflation is running at 6 percent and the real 
policy rate is equal to a"’6 percent, a gap of 12 percenta€”smaller than in 1975, but still 
strikingly largea€!. It then took 8 years, from 1975 to 1983, to reduce inflation to 4 percent, 
with an increase in the real rate from bottom to peak of close to
1,300 basis points, and a peak increase in the unemployment rate of 600 basis points from the early 
1970s. Today is obviously different in many waysa€!. [But even so,] it reasonable to think that a 
200-basis-point increase in the policy rate, so only 1/6 of the rate increase from 1975 to 1981, 
will do the job this time when the gap between core inflation and the policy rate is 2/3 of what it 
was in 1975? And that unemployment will barely
budge? I wish I could believe ita€! 
<https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/whv-i-worrv-about-inflation-interest-rate
s-and-unemplovment>

The suggestion seems to be that we have today 2/3 of the problem we had in 1975, and so the 
solution would be to do 2/3 as mucha€”to raise interest rates by 800 basis points, 8% pointsa€”but 
then to apply some haircut to that 800 basis-point interest-rate rise because a€oetoday is 
obviously different in many waysa€D.
But why does he pick 1975-1983, rather than 1951 or 1948 or 1920? Does economic theory tell him to 
do so?

Truth be told, there is no economic theory. There is only history, and its events, and analogies we 
make based on judgments concerning complicated emergent processes we do not understand very well 
that come out of the millions of interactions that are the economy. Sometimes, it is true, we 
distill and crystallize the history into something we call theory where little squiggles that look 
like E£, T, I2, If, and so on; we then mainline the crystallized product. After
mainlining it we can think we know something. But after mainlining crystal meth we experience 
increased energy, elevated mood, extraordinary confidence, racing thoughts, muscle twitches, and 
rapid breathing, among other things.

Move cautiously. Be data-dependent. Wait for it to become clearer which, if any, historical 
analogies are relevant to our situation. And always, always, always remember that in an economy 
that is near and that we have a good reason to fear will long remain in danger of hitting the zero 
lower bound on nominal interest rates, premature and excessively aggressive moves that raise 
interest rates cannot easily be corrected.

It has been hard to understand the attitude of many Republicans towards Donald Trump and company 
without the idea that, at some level, they are for some reason personally frightened. It has, I 
think, been a major failure of the British government that it has allowed Putina€™ s FSB to extend 
its tentacles the way it looks as though it has:

Subject: My a€oeBehind the Iron Curtaina€D Lecture for a€oeHistory of Economic Growtha€D

It now looks as though, given all the slides I have and everything I have written down in the 
lecture notes, it would be six hours long. It can only be 1 l/2a€”I have too many other things I 
need to cover.
Here is a chunk from it:

6.13. The Marxist Faith

6.13.1. Lenina€™s Faith: The relatively small group of socialist agitators that had gathered under 
Lenina€™ s banner before the revolution and cut their teeth during the years of civil war began 
their task with a faith-based expectation of help. Because the Marxist-Engelsian sciences of 
dialectical and historical materialism had told them so, Lenin and his comrades confidently 
expected their revolution in Russia to be followed by other, similar communist
revolutions in the more advanced, industrial countries of Western Europe. Once they were communist, 
they believed, these countries would provide aid to poor, agrarian Russia, and so make it possible 
for Lenin to stay in power as he guided his country to a stage of industrial development where 
socialism might function the way Marx had promised it would. Lenin pinned his hopes on the most 
industrialized country in Europe, with the largest and most active
socialist political party: Germany. A communist republic briefly held power in Hungary. Another one 
briefly held power in Bavaria, in southern Germany. But, in the end, the Russian Revolution was the 
only one that stuck.

Thus the story of building an alternative to market-capitalist society a€’’building really-existing 
socialisma€”in one and only one very poor and non-industrialized country began.

6.13.2. The a€oeDictatorship of the Proletariate□: Really-existing socialisma€’’distantly descended 
from the idea of Marx, Engels, and companya€”was the interpretation of a dream, implemented via 
something called the a€oedictatorship of the proletariat.a€D That first word, a€ redictatorship 
,a€D meant, for the phrasea€™ s coiner, Joseph Wedemeyera€”as it meant for Marx and Engelsa€”the 
temporary suspension of checks and balances, procedural
impediments, and established powers, so the government could make the needed changes and actually 
governa€’’violently, when necessary, to overcome reactionary opposition. Originally it meant the 
same non-permanent thing for Lenin.

But in whose interest would it govern?

In Lenina€™ s mind, that concentrated power would be administered for the proletariat. Why not just 
have a dictatorship of the peoplea€”a democracy? Because, Lenin believed, all societya€™ s 
non-proletariat classes had selfish interests. To allow them any political power during the initial 
post-revolutionary dictatorship would only retard the inevitable progress of history. Which was 
towardutopia. Which was true socialism.

6.133. Fixing the 20th Century Meaning of a€oeSocialisma€D: I trust I give little away when I tell 
you, really-existing socialism was, in the hands of its disciples, to become the most murderous of 
the totalitarian ideologies of the twentieth century. Admitting this now can, and should, help 
focus our attention.

Until it really existed, a€oesocialisma€n could mean many thingsa€”things other than the system 
Lenin created and Stalin solidified. In Western Europe and North America during the World War I 
era, most who called themselves any flavor of a€oesocialista€n held that in a good society there 
ought to be enormous scope for individual initiative, for  diversity, for the decentralizationof 
decision-making, forliberal values, and even for non-commanding-heights
private property. True freedom was, after all, the point. Eliminating the unequal distribution of 
income under capitalism that kept the bulk of the formerly free imprisoned in the same life of 
drudgery and imprisonment was the goal.

In price regulation and in public ownership, the question was an empirical one: private where 
private belongs, public where it was needed. And most people trusted representative democracy and 
rational argument to settle things case by case. But others took a more radical view, pushing for 
something beyond even a reformed, well-managed, and gentler market economy. It wasna€™ t until 
Lenin began to exercise power that people began to discover the
tradeoffs that would be involved in a really-existing socialism focused on destroying the power of 
the market.

6.133. Marxa€™s Optimism About History: Lenin, his followers, and his successors began with a 
general article of faith: Karl Marx was right. In everything. If properly interpreted.

Marx had mocked the sober businessmen of his time. They claimed to view revolution with horror. 
Yet, Marx asserted, they were themselves, in a sense, the most ruthless revolutionaries the world 
had ever seen. The business classa€”what Marx called the bourgeoisiea€.”yNas responsible for the 
(up to then) greatest of all revolutions, and that revolution had changed the human condition. For 
the better. After all, it was the business class of entrepreneurs and
investors, together with the market economy that pitted them against one another, that was 
responsible for bringing an end to the scarcity, want, and oppression that had been human destiny 
heretofore.

6.13.4. Marxa€™s Pessimism About Capitalism: But Marx also saw an inescapable danger: the economic 
system that the bourgeoisie had created would inevitably become the main obstacle to human 
happiness. It could, Marx thought, create wealth, but it could not distribute wealth evenly. 
Alongside prosperity would inevitably come increasing disparities of wealth. The rich would become 
richer. The poor would become poorer, and they would be kept in a
poverty made all the more unbearable for being needless. The only solution was to utterly destroy 
the power of the market system to boss people around.

My use of a€reinescapablea€D and a€oeinevitablea€n is not for dramatic effect. Inevitability was 
for Marx and the inheritors of his ideas the fix to a fatal flaw. Marx spent his entire life trying 
to make his argument simple, comprehensible, and watertight. He  failed. He failed because he was 
wrong. It is simply not the case that market economies necessarily produce ever-risinginequalityand 
ever-increasing immiseration in the company of ever-increasing
wealth. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they do not. And whether they do or do not is within the 
control of the government, which has sufficiently powerful tools to narrow and widen the income and 
wealth distribution to fit its purposes.

Marx, however, decided to prove that the existing system guaranteed dystopia:

The more productive capital grows, the more the division of labor and the application of machinery 
expands. The more the division of labor and the application of machinery expands, the more 
competition among the workers expands and the more their wages contract. The forest of uplifted 
arms demanding work becomes thicker and thicker, while the arms themselves become thinnerand 
thinnera€!

Marx was also certain that his dystopian vision of late capitalism would not be the end state of 
human history. For this bleak capitalist system was to be overthrown by one that nationalized and 
socialized the means of production. The rule of the business class, after creating a truly 
prosperous society, would a€reproduce ... above all... its own gravediggers.a€D

6.13.5. Marxa€™s Vagueness About Utopia: What would society be like after the revolution? Instead 
of private property, there would be a€oeindividual property based on ... cooperation and the 
possession in common of the land and of the means of production.a€D And this would happen easily,

6.I.4.I. The Causal Thinness of the Bolshevik Revolution: Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Joseph 
Stalin, and a few othersa€’’rounding out the Soviet Uniona€™ s first Politburo were Lev Kamenev and 
Nikolai Krestinskya€”were a small enough group that it is plausible to wonder what would have 
happened if different people with differing characters and different views had shaken out on top. 
They didna€™t, and perhaps it was because these men were not
just scholars and journalists, not just the inept and hopeful, but also sufficiently capable, 
timely, and ruthless.

6.I.4.2. What Lenin & Company Made: Lenin and his successors, all the way down to 1990, took the 
doctrines of Marx the prophet seriously. And they tried to make them real. But they were not gods. 
While they said, a€reLet there be true socialism,a€D what they made was, instead, really-existing 
socialism. It was socialism in that it claimed to have gotten as close to the hopes of Marx and 
other socialists as could be realizeda€”but it was also enacted in
reality, on the ground, in regimes that at their peak ruled perhaps one-third of the worlda€™ s 
population. It was not an intellectual utopian fantasy, but a necessary compromise with the 
messiness of this world. Really-existing socialism was, its propagandists and apparatchiks claimed, 
as close to utopia as it was possible to get.

6.1.43. Marxa€™s Probable Attitude to RES: Throughout most of really-existing socialisma€™ s 
career, Marx would probably have regarded it with dismay and perhaps disdaina€”a frequent fate of 
prophets. To really exist, socialism had to depart in significant ways from the predictions (and 
the instructions) of the prophet. For, it turns out, not only do you have to break eggs to make an 
omelet, but the omelet you end up makinga€’’indeed, whether what
you make can be called an omelet at alla€’’depends a good bit on the eggs you have at hand. This 
matters, because Russia in the early twentieth century was not where any of the early theorists of 
what became really-existing socialism ever thought socialism would first really exist. And for good 
reason.

6.1.4.4. RA©gime Imperative: Survival: The i-Orst imperative Lenina€™ s regime faced was survival. 
But the first imperative the regime thought it faced was the elimination of capitalism by way of 
nationalizing private property and removing business owners from management. How, though, do you 
run industry and economic life in the absence of business ownersa€”in the absence of people whose 
incomes and social standing depend directly on the
prosperity of individual enterprises, and who have the incentives and the power to try to make and 
keep individual pieces of the economy productive and functioning? Lenina€™ s answer was that you 
organize the economy like an army: top down, planned, hierarchical, with under managers promoted, 
fired, or shot depending on how well they attained the missions that the high economic command 
assigned them.

6.1.4.5. The New Economic Policy of the 1920s: Initially, however, the building of really-existing 
socialism required stepping back from war communism and into the a€oeNew Economic Policya€D of the 
1920, which required letting prices rise and fall, letting people buy and sell and get richer, 
letting managers of government factories make profits (or be sacked), and letting a class of 
merchants and middlemen grow, as what Keynes called a€retolerated
outlaws.a€D It was an expediency. Capitalism, but subject to state control; socialized state 
enterprises, but run on a profit basis. And while the leash was rarely tugged, it remained.

6.1.5. Really-Existing Socialist Economies

6.13.1. How a a€oeCommand Economya€D Has to Work: Part of the expedience was due to the fact that 
the centralized Soviet government had limited grasp. Even by the mid-1930s, the planners could only 
track material balances for about one hundred commodities. The movements of these were indeed 
centrally planned. Nationwide, producers of these commodities who did not fulfill their goals 
according to the plan were sanctioned. Otherwise,
commodities were exchanged between businesses and shipped out to users either through standard 
market cash-on-the-barrelhead transactions or via blaf. connections. Who you knew mattered.

When blat, market exchange, or central planning failed to obtain the raw materials an enterprise 
needed, there was another option: the tolkachi, or barter agents. Tolkachi would find out who had 
the goods you needed, what they were valued, and what goods you might be able to acquire given what 
you had to barter with.

6.1.5.2. Command vs. Market?: If this sounds degrees familiar, it should.

One hidden secret of capitalist business is that most companiesa€™ internal organizations are a lot 
like the crude material balance calculations of the Soviet planners. Inside the firm, commodities 
and time are not allocated through any kind of market access process. Individuals want to 
accomplish the mission of the organization, please their bosses so they get promoted, or at least 
so they dona€™t get fired, and assist others. They swap favors, formally or
informally. They note that particular goals and benchmarks are high priorities, and that the top 
bosses will be displeased if they are not accomplished. They use social engineering and 
arm-twisting skills. They ask for permission to outsource, or dig into their own pockets for 
incidentals. Market, barter, blat, and plan, this last understood as the organization^™ s primary 
purposes and peoplea€™ s allegiance to it, always rule, albeit in different proportions.


revolutions in the more advanced, industrial countries of Western Europe. Once they were communist, 
they believed, these countries would provide aid to poor, agrarian Russia, and so make it possible 
for Lenin to stay in power as he guided his country to a stage of industrial development where 
socialism might function the way Marx had promised it would. Lenin pinned his hopes on the most 
industrialized country in Europe, with the largest and most active
socialist political party: Germany. A communist republic briefly held power in Hungary. Another one 
briefly held power in Bavaria, in southern Germany. But, in the end, the Russian Revolution was the 
only one that stuck.

Thus the story of building an alternative to market-capitalist society a€’’building really-existing 
socialisms ”in one and only one very poor and non-industrialized country began.

6.13.2. The SceDictatorship of the Proletariats □: Really-existing socialisms’’distantly descended 
from the idea of Marx, Engels, and companyS”was the interpretation of a dream, implemented via 
something called the Soedictatorship of the proletariat.a€D That first word, See dictator ship ,SD 
meant, for the phraseS™ s coiner, Joseph WedemeyerS”as it meant for Marx and EngelsS”the temporary 
suspension of checks and balances, procedural
impediments, and established powers, so the government could make the needed changes and actually 
governs’’violently, when necessary, to overcome reactionary opposition. Originally it meant the 
same non-permanent thing for Lenin.

But in whose interest would it govern?

In LeninS™ s mind, that concentrated power would be administered for the proletariat. Why not just 
have a dictatorship of the peopleS”a democracy? Because, Lenin believed, all societyS™ s 
non-proletariat classes had selfish interests. To allow them any political power during the initial 
post-revolutionary dictatorship would only retard the inevitable progress of history. Which was 
toward utopia. Which was true socialism.

6.133. Fixing the 20th Century Meaning of SceSocialismSD: I trust I give little away when I tell 
you, really-existing socialism was, in the hands of its disciples, to become the most murderous of 
the totalitarian ideologies of the twentieth century. Admitting this now can, and should, help 
focus our attention.

Until it really existed, ScesocialismSD could mean many thingsS”things other than the system Lenin 
created and Stalin solidified. In Western Europe and North America during the World War I era, most 
who called themselves any flavor of a€resocialista€D held that in a good society there ought to be 
enormous scope for individual initiative, for diversity, for the decentralization of 
decision-making, for liberal values, and even for non-commanding-heights
private property. True freedom was, after all, the point. Eliminating the unequal distribution of 
income under capitalism that kept the bulk of the formerly free imprisoned in the same life of 
drudgery and imprisonment was the goal.

In price regulation and in public ownership, the question was an empirical one: private where 
private belongs, public where it was needed. And most people trusted representative democracy and 
rational argument to settle things case by case. But others took a more radical view, pushing for 
something beyond even a reformed, well-managed, and gentler market economy. It wasnS™ t until Lenin 
began to exercise power that people began to discover the
tradeoffs that would be involved in a really-existing socialism focused on destroying the power of 
the market.

6.133. MarxS™s Optimism About History: Lenin, his followers, and his successors began with a 
general article of faith: Karl Marx was right. In everything. If properly interpreted.

Marx had mocked the sober businessmen of his time. They claimed to view revolution with horror. 
Yet, Marx asserted, they were themselves, in a sense, the most ruthless revolutionaries the world 
had ever seen. The business classS”what Marx called the bourgeoisiea^yNas responsible for the (up 
to then) greatest of all revolutions, and that revolution had changed the human condition. For the 
better. After all, it was the business class of entrepreneurs and
investors, together with the market economy that pitted them against one another, that was 
responsible for bringing an end to the scarcity, want, and oppression that had been human destiny 
heretofore.

6.13.4. MarxS™s Pessimism About Capitalism: But Marx also saw an inescapable danger: the economic 
system that the bourgeoisie had created would inevitably become the main obstacle to human 
happiness. It could, Marx thought, create wealth, but it could not distribute wealth evenly. 
Alongside prosperity would inevitably come increasing disparities of wealth. The rich would become 
richer. The poor would become poorer, and they would be kept in a
poverty made all the more unbearable for being needless. The only solution was to utterly destroy 
the power of the market system to boss people around.

My use of a€reinescapablea€D and SoeinevitableSD is not for dramatic effect. Inevitability was for 
Marx and the inheritors of his ideas the fix to a fatal flaw. Marx spent his entire life trying to 
make his argument simple, comprehensible, and watertight. He failed. He failed because he was 
wrong. It is simply not the case that market economies necessarily produce ever-rising 
inequalityand ever-increasing  immiseration in the company of ever-increasing
wealth. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they do not. And whether they do or do not is within the 
control of the government, which has sufficiently powerful tools to narrow and widen the income and 
wealth distribution to fit its purposes.

Marx, however, decided to prove that the existing system guaranteed dystopia:

The more productive capital grows, the more the division of labor and the application of machinery 
expands. The more the division of labor and the application of machinery expands, the more 
competition among the workers expands and the more their wages contract. The forest of uplifted 
arms demanding work becomes thicker and thicker, while the arms themselvesbecome thinnerand 
thinnerS!

Marx was also certain that his dystopian vision of late capitalism would not be the end state of 
human history. For this bleak capitalist system was to be overthrown by one that nationalized and 
socialized the means of production. The rule of the business class, after creating a truly 
prosperous society, would a€ reproduce ... above all... its own gravediggers.a€D

6.13.5. MarxS™s Vagueness About Utopia: What would society be like after the revolution? Instead of 
private property, there would be Soeindividual property based on ... cooperation and the possession 
in common of the land and of the means of production.a€D And this would happen easily, for 
socialist revolution would simply require Seethe expropriation of a few usurpers by the mass of the 
people,SD who would then democratically decide upon
a common plan for Soeextension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the 
bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally.a€D VoilA , 
utopia.

the centralized Soviet government had limited grasp. Even by the mid-1930s, the planners could only 
track material balances for about one hundred commodities. The movements of these were indeed 
centrally planned. Nationwide, producers of these commodities who did not fulfill their goals 
according to the plan were sanctioned. Otherwise,
commodities were exchanged between businesses and shipped out to users either through standard 
market cash-on-the-barrelhead transactions or via blaf. connections. Who you knew mattered.

When blat, market exchange, or central planning failed to obtain the raw materials an enterprise 
needed, there was another option: the tolkachi, or barter agents. Tolkachi would find out who had 
the goods you needed, what they were valued, and what goods you might be able to acquire given what 
you had to barter with.

6.1.5.2. Command vs. Market?: If this sounds degrees familiar, it should.

One hidden secret of capitalist business is that most companiesa€™ internal organizations are a lot 
like the crude material balance calculations of the Soviet planners. Inside the firm, commodities 
and time are not allocated through any kind of market access process. Individuals want to 
accomplish the mission of the organization, please their bosses so they get promoted, or at least 
so they dona€™t get fired, and assist others. They swap favors, formally or
informally. They note that particular goals and benchmarks are high priorities, and that the top 
bosses will be displeased if they are not accomplished. They use social engineering and 
arm-twisting skills. They ask for permission to outsource, or dig into their own pockets for 
incidentals. Market, barter, blat, and plan, this last understood as the organization^™ s primary 
purposes and peoplea€™ s allegiance to it, always rule, albeit in different proportions.

The key difference, perhaps, is that a standard business firm is embedded in a much larger market 
economy, and so is always facing the make-or-buy decision: Can this resource be acquired most 
efficiently from elsewhere within the firm, via social engineering or arm-twisting or blat, or is 
it better to seek budgetary authority to purchase it from outside? That make-or-buy decision is a 
powerful factor keeping businesses in capitalist market economies on their
toes, and more efficient. And in capitalist market economies, factory-owning firms are surrounded 
by clouds of middlemen. In the Soviet Union, the broad market interfaces of individual factories 
and the clouds of middlemen were absent. As a consequence, its economy was grossly wasteful.

Though wasteful, material balance control is an expedient that pretty much all societies adopt 
during wartime. Then hitting a small number of specific targets for production becomes thexf 
highest priority. In times of total mobilization, command-and-control seems the best we can do. But 
do we wish a society in which all times are times of total mobilization?

6.1.53. The State of the USSR in the Late 1920s: Leta€™ s pause briefly to consider the state of 
the Soviet Union in the late 1920s. By 1927, the Soviet Union had recovered to where it had been in 
1914a€”in terms of life expectancy, population, industrial production, and standards of living. The 
imperative of survival had been met. And there was no longer the deadweight of the czarist 
aristocracy consuming resources and thinking and behaving feudally. As
long as Lenina€™ s successors could avoid destroying the country through their own mistakes, and as 
long as they could keep encouraging people to judge their management of things against a baseline 
of war and chaos, it would be hard for them to fall out of favor.

The recovered Soviet Union remained subject to existential threats, to be sure. Those in the upper 
echelons of Soviet government greatly feared that the capitalist powers of the industrial core 
would decide to overthrow their regime. Someday soon, their thinking went, the really-existing 
socialist regime might have to fight yet another war to survive. They remembered that they had 
already fought two: a civil war, in which Britain and Japan had at least thought
about making a serious effort to support their enemies; and a war against Poland to the west. They 
were desperately aware of the Soviet Uniona€™ s economic and political weaknesses. To meet external 
threats, the Soviet leaders had ideology, a small cadre of ruthless adherents, and a bureaucracy 
that sort of ran an economy recovered to its 1914 level. What they didna€™ t have was time.

They were not wrong.

On June 22,1941, Adolf Hitlera€™ s Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union. Its aims were twofold: 
first, to exterminate Jewish Bolshevism as an idea, a political movement, and a regime; and second, 
to herd onto reservations, enslave, or exterminate the bulk of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union. 
The land they occupied was needed to provide larger farms for German farmers and more a€reliving 
spacea€na€”Lebensrauma€.”for the German nation.

6.1.5.4. a€oePrimitive Accumulation^□ in the USSR: The Bolsheviks thought they were viewed by the 
non-socialist powers as an existential threat. And all the Bolsheviks agreed that to survive, 
Russia needed to industrialize rapidly. But how were they to persuade the peasants to boost 
agricultural production if they had no factory-made consumer goods to trade for their grain?

Marx had interpreted the economic history of Britain as one of a€reprimitive accumulation.a€D 
Landlords had used the political system to steal land from the peasantry and squeeze their standard 
of living. This forced some of the peasantry to migrate to the cities, where they became a 
penniless urban working class. There, manufacturers and owners of means of production used the 
political system to force them to build and work in factories.

For Marx, this awful outcome was one of the things that made capitalism an obstacle to human 
development and flourishing. The Bolsheviks took Marxa€™ s critique of British modernization and 
made it their business model. Not just Stalin, but Trotsky, Yevgeni Preobrazhensky, and others 
among the elite had concluded that rapid industrialization was possible only if the ruling 
communists first waged economic war against Russiaa€™ s peasants. They would
squeeze their standard of living as much as possible in order to feed and populate the growing 
industrial cities. They would keep urban wages high enough to provide a steady stream of migrants 
to city jobs, but no higher.

6.I.5.5. The a€oeScissors Crisisa€D: This strategy was the first of what would ultimately become a 
series of Five-Year Plans.

The a€oegoods faminea€D this policy generated shifted urban production from consumer goods to 
capital goods, and from light industry to heavy industrya€’’ultimately bringing about a a€oegrain 
famine.a€D The result was a a€oescissors crisisa€D: As the price of industrial goods manufactured 
in cities continued to rise to meet the governments™ s investment targets, the price of farm goods 
fell, and on the graph, the widening gap looked like a pair of
scissors. Peasants unable to buy manufactures (and increasingly uninterested in doing so) were also 
unable to sell farm goods. The cities struggled to be fed, threatening the Five-Year Plan and 
Russiaa€™ s ability to industrialize, which Bolsheviks believed would determine its ability to 
survive.


6.13.4. Marxa€™s Pessimism About Capitalism: But Marx also saw an inescapable danger: the economic 
system that the bourgeoisie had created would inevitably become the main obstacle to human 
happiness. It could, Marx thought, create wealth, but it could not distribute wealth evenly. 
Alongside prosperity would inevitably come increasing disparities of wealth. The rich would become 
richer. The poor would become poorer, and they would be kept in a

poverty made all the more unbearable for being needless. The only solution was to utterly destroy 
the power of the market system to boss people around.

My use of a€ceinescapablea€D and a€reinevitablea€n is not for dramatic effect. Inevitability was 
for Marx and the inheritors of his ideas the fix to a fatal flaw. Marx spent his entire life trying 
to make his argument simple, comprehensible, and watertight. He failed. He failed because he was 
wrong. It is simply not the case that market economies necessarily produce ever-rising inequality 
and ever-increasing immiseration in the company of ever-increasing
wealth. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they do not. And whether they do or do not is within the 
control of the government, which has sufficiently powerful tools to narrow and widen the income and 
wealth distribution to fit its purposes.

Marx, however, decided to prove that the existing system guaranteed dystopia:

The more productive capital grows, the more the division of labor and the application of machinery 
expands. The more the division of labor and the application of machinery expands, the more 
competition among the workers expands and the more their wages contract. The forest of uplifted

highest priority. In times of total mobilization, command-and-control seems the best we can do. But 
do we wish a society in which all times are times of total mobilization?

6.1.53. The State of the USSR in the Late 1920s: Leta€™ s pause briefly to consider the state of 
the Soviet Union in the late 1920s. By 1927, the Soviet Union had recovered to where it had been in 
1914a€”in terms of life expectancy, population, industrial production, and standards of living. The 
imperative of survival had been met. And there was no longer the deadweight of the czarist 
aristocracy consuming resources  and thinking and behaving feudally.As
long as Lenina€™ s successors could avoid destroying the country through their own mistakes, and as 
long as they could keep encouraging people to judge their management of things against a baseline 
of war and chaos, it would be hard for them to fall out of favor.

The recovered Soviet Union remained subject to existential threats, to be sure. Those in the upper 
echelons of Soviet government greatly feared that the capitalist powers of the industrial core 
would decide to overthrow their regime. Someday soon, their thinking went, the really-existing 
socialist regime might have to fight yet another war to survive. They remembered that they had 
already fought two: a civil war, in which Britain and Japan had at least thought
about making a serious effort to support their enemies; and a war against Poland to the west. They 
were desperately aware of the Soviet Uniona€™ s economic and political weaknesses. To meet external 
threats, the Soviet leaders had ideology, a small cadre of ruthless adherents, and a bureaucracy 
that sort of ran an economy recovered to its 1914 level. What they didna€™ t have was time.

They were not wrong.

On June 22,1941, Adolf Hitlera€™ s Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union. Its aims were twofold: 
first, to exterminate Jewish Bolshevism as an idea, a political movement, and a regime; and second, 
to herd onto reservations, enslave, or exterminate the bulk of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union. 
The land they occupied was needed to provide larger farms for German farmers and more a€reliving 
spacea€na€”Lebensrauma€.”for the German nation.

6.1.5.4. a€oePrimitive Accumulation^□ in the USSR: The Bolsheviks thought they were viewed by the 
non-socialist powers as an existential threat. And all the Bolsheviks agreed that to survive, 
Russia needed to industrialize rapidly. But how were they to persuade the peasants to boost 
agricultural production if they had no factory-made consumer goods to trade for their grain?

Marx had interpreted the economic history of Britain as one of a€reprimitive accumulation.a€D 
Landlords had used the political system to steal land from the peasantry and squeeze their standard 
of living. This forced some of the peasantry to migrate to the cities, where they became a 
penniless urban working class. There, manufacturers and owners of means of production used the 
political system to force them to build and work in factories.

For Marx, this awful outcome was one of the things that made capitalism an obstacle to human 
development and flourishing. The Bolsheviks took Marxa€™ s critique of British modernization and 
made it their business model. Not just Stalin, but Trotsky, Yevgeni Preobrazhensky, and others 
among the elite had concluded that rapid industrialization was possible only if the ruling 
communists first waged economic war against Russiaa€™ s peasants. They would
squeeze their standard of living as much as possible in order to feed and populate the growing 
industrial cities. They would keep urban wages high enough to provide a steady stream of migrants 
to city jobs, but no higher.

6.I.5.5. The a€oeScissors Crisisa€D: This strategy was the first of what would ultimately become a 
series of Five-Year Plans.

The a€oegoods faminea€D this policy generated shifted urban production from consumer goods to 
capital goods, and from light industry to heavy industrya€’’ultimately bringing about a a€oegrain 
famine.a€D The result was a a€oescissors crisisa€D: As the price of industrial goods manufactured 
in cities continued to rise to meet the governments™ s investment targets, the price of farm goods 
fell, and on the graph, the widening gap looked like a pair of
scissors. Peasants unable to buy manufactures (and increasingly uninterested in doing so) were also 
unable to sell farm goods. The cities struggled to be fed, threatening the Five-Year Plan and 
Russiaa€™ s ability to industrialize, which Bolsheviks believed would determine its ability to 
survive.
