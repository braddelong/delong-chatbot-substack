<p><strong>Noah Smith</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The minimum wage pushback</em>: ‘Most of the discussion about the minimum wage centers on the potential costs of the policy—especially whether it will cause unemployment. This seems like a huge mistake. In general, every policy has costs and benefits, and to ignore the benefits introduces bias to the discussion. The whole point of minimum wage is to reduce poverty. Many papers find that it does do this. For example, a 2019 paper by Arindrajit Dube finds that doubling the minimum wage would result in somewhere between a 2.2% and a 4.5% drop in poverty. That’s not a knockout blow, but it would be substantial, since the overall poverty rate is around 12%…. By refusing to even talk about the poverty reduction aspect of minimum wage, we’re doing the debate a disservice. Note the huge difference from the discussion on trade. Advocates of free trade will admit that a minority of Americans will lose out from the policy. But they argue that because the benefits of free trade outweigh the cost overall, we should implement free trade and “compensate the losers”…. The strongest argument against the federal minimum wage is that it’s a one-size-fits-all policy that fails to take regional variations into account…. This argument is correct!… So it makes sense to worry about places for which costs and wages are both low, and so $15 is pretty high…. Allow areas with low costs and low wages to start out at a bit lower than $15 and advance to $15 as their median wages grow over time…. The Democrats’ proposal already contains something along these lines—it would index future minimum growth to local median wages. And the proposal already includes a long phase-in—the minimum wage wouldn’t reach $15 til 2025…. What does the evidence really say? It’s fine to talk about monopsony power and all, but ultimately the case that the minimum wage is a pretty-safe policy rests on the weight of empirical evidence. And that evidence has been powerful enough to change economists’ minds over a fairly short space of time… Remember that in 2013, 34% of top economists surveyed by the University of Chicago agreed that a $9 federal minimum wage would “make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment”. Just two years, later, in 2015, the same survey found that only 26% of economists agreed that a $15 federal minimum wage would mean that “the employment rate for low-wage US workers will be substantially lower than it would be under the status quo.”… Neumark and Shirley’s median “preferred” estimate is –0.116. Dube’s graph above notes that the median estimate for “any group” is –0.17. In other words, the studies Dube reviews tend to find some subgroup of workers—teenage dropouts, or whatever—who experience pretty significant job losses from minimum wage hikes…. A high minimum wage is very bad for certain small groups of workers, while not very harmful for low-wage workers overall. Which brings us back to costs and benefits… LINK:&nbsp;<a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-minimum-wage-pushback">https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-minimum-wage-pushback</a></p><p><strong>Matthew Yglesias</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The “induced demand“ case against YIMBYism is wrong</em>: ‘[It] fails on four scores: It is empirically false, at least most of the time. Accepting its logic would counsel against all efforts to improve quality of life. If it were true, it still wouldn’t follow that new construction is bad. It misconstrues what the YIMBY proposal is in the first place. As I say, I don’t really believe that people believing in the induced demand argument explains any of the proximate barriers to housing reform. But it does come up a lot online, so I’d like to have a resource for explaining to people what’s wrong with it…. Empirically, more supply lowers prices… Kate Pennington’s recent study of San Francisco is very precise: “I find that rents fall by 2% for parcels within 100m of new construction. Renters’ risk of being displaced to a lower-income neighborhood falls by 17%. Both effects decay linearly to zero within 1.5km.”… Oliva… actually finds induced demand… the Inner Harbor project in Baltimore which transformed a largely derelict stretch of waterfront…. This is all good empirical work. But note that I don’t think anyone has ever argued that building an aquarium will reduce housing cost burdens. The Inner Harbor is (by design) a tourist attraction…. If you build a nice place to visit in the middle of a city, then the immediately adjacent homes become more desirable…. New infill housing appears to empirically neutralize the induced demand by simultaneously inducing supply. But conceptually there’s a question here—is it bad to make neighborhoods better places to live?… Consider the following argument…. New amenities will make the neighborhood a more attractive place to live. Because the neighborhood is now more attractive, prices will rise. Rising prices will displace some existing residents. Therefore we shouldn’t allow new buildings to be constructed…. An infinite cycle of bad urban policy. Defund police will lead to more murders? Well, that’s good for housing affordability…. This is all wrong, wrong, wrong. We simply cannot accept “make sure the neighborhood sucks” as our affordable housing strategy… LINK:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/induced-demand">https://www.slowboring.com/p/induced-demand</a></p>
