A life expectancy of less than thirty. Ferocious mortality meant that in the typical couple the woman spent nearly two decades eating for two—eight pregnancies for six live births to get three children surviving to age ten, and barely more than two surviving to reproduce.</p><p>Why was mortality so high? Because the typical person was undernourished and stunted: human populations were too large relative to our low (and slowly improving) level of technology and our limited ability to harvest natural resources. Why were populations pressing so hard upon the limits of subsistence? Because patriarchy meant that women’s durable social power came pretty much only from being mothers of surviving sons. Slowly-improving technology meant that there was only  room for the next generation to be a bit more numerous than the last: the pre-1870 human population growth rate was 10% per century, or less. </p><p>And so about one woman in three was left without surviving sons. </p><p>Hence, even if you already had a son or sons, the pressure to try to have another, just in case your current son or sons died was immense. That meant that whenever any technological headroom to support higher productivity and grant a household greater resources emerged, the overwhelming pressure was to use those resources to boost the population. That was the force that kept humanity poor. thus before 1870 it was Thomas Robert Malthus’s world: humanity ensorcelled by and under the spell of the Malthusian devil.</p><p>That, however, was not all.</p><p>In a poor world, with limited technology and upward pressure on the population creating resource scarcity, it was only possible for a few to have <em><strong>enough</strong></em>. Moreover, the way those few could get <em><strong>enough</strong></em> for themselves and their children was for them through force and fraud, to run an exploitation-and-extraction machine against the bulk of humanity. Humanity’s societal energies were thus directed not toward making humanity more productive but, rather, toward making the force-and-fraud exploitation-and-extraction system run more securely—punctuated by the occasional peasant revolt. In such a world, those ideas that were promoted and thus flourished were not those that made humanity capable of doing more things more efficiently and effectively. They were, instead, the ideas that shored-up the force-and-fraud exploitation-and-extraction system. Thus the rate of technological advance was slow indeed: figure 5% per century.</p><p>Thus my crude guess is that there has been as much proportional technological progress—useful ideas discovered, developed, deployed, and then diffused throughout the global economy—making humanity more productive in the 150-year span since 1870 as there were in the entire nearly 10,000-year span since the beginnings of the creation of agriculture around the year -8000.&nbsp; Moreover, from -8000 to 1870 poverty, patriarchy, and slow technological progress kept humanity under the spell of the Devil of Malthus, with nearly all of the potential benefits of better technology being eaten up by population growth and resulting resource scarcity. Think of something like $900/year—the living standard of the poorest half-billion of our eight billion today—as the living standards of a typical human back before 1870.</p><p>Then, after 1870, everything changed.</p><p>Economic historians debate and will debate as long as there is a human species and perhaps longer exactly why the change came in 1870, whether the change could have come earlier—perhaps starting in Alexandria, Egypt back in the year 170 when Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus ruled in Rome, or in the year 1170 when Emperor Gaozong ruled in Hangzhou—or whether we might have missed the bus that arrived in 1870 and still, today, be trapped in a Malthusian steampunk, gunpowder-empire, or neo-mediæval world. But we did not miss the bus. A lot of things had to go right and fall into place to create the astonishingly-rich-in-historical-perspective world we have today. And the last three elements—modern science and the industrial research lab to discover and develop useful technologies, the modern corporation to develop and deploy them, and the globalized market economy to deploy and diffuse them throughout the world—fell into place around 1870.</p><p>Ever since, advancing science, turned into technology by industrial research labs, deployed at scale by modern corporations, and then diffused throughout the world by that magnificent crowdsourcing mechanism that is the global market economy have taken us on a wild ride. The rate of global technological progress, a rate that was perhaps 0.05%/year before 1500, 0.15%/year over 1500-1770, and perhaps 0.45%/year over 1770-1870, went into high gear, and has averaged 2.1%/year on average since. The deployed-and-diffused technological capabilities of humanity have thus roughly doubled every generation since 1870.</p><p>Thus from the perspective of humanity in 1870, by 2010 humanity ought to have been able to solve the economic problem, and so been on the road to a fundamentally different kind of society. But was it the road to utopia? Or to someplace else?</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/from-the-cutting-room-floor-a-prologue?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/from-the-cutting-room-floor-a-prologue?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Robert Kuttner</strong>: <em>FDR’s Legacy &amp; President Biden’s New Deal Opportunity</em> &lt;<a href="https:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2voA-NG9GA">https:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2voA-NG9GA</a>&gt;: </p><div id="youtube2-d2voA-NG9GA" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;d2voA-NG9GA&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d2voA-NG9GA?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Very Briefly Noted:</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Sarah McBride &amp; Lizette Chapman</strong>: <em>Andreessen Horowitz Pushes VC Center of Gravity Away From Bay Area</em>: ‘The location of&nbsp;its new headquarters: “the cloud”….

Part of it is that, in history, there have been few democracies that neighboring autocracies have thought worthy of devoting resources to an information attack. I read Farrell and Schneider, and and all of a sudden I want to learn much, much more about fifth columns undermining democracies in the interests of fascism in the 1930s, and on Philip of Macedon's creation and maintenance of a pro-Macedonian faction in Athens, as Philip rose to be <em><strong>hegemon</strong></em> of Greece:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Henry Farrell &amp; Bruce Schneier</strong>: <em>Common-Knowledge Attacks on Democracy</em>: ‘Stable autocracies will have common knowledge over who is in charge and their associated ideological or policy goals, but will generate contested knowledge over who the various political actors in society are, and how they might form coalitions and gain public support, so as to make it more difficult for coalitions to displace the regime. Stable democracies will have contested knowledge over who is in charge, but common knowledge over who the political actors are, and how they may form coalitions and gain public support. These differences are associated with notably different attack surfaces and threat models. Specifically, democracies are vulnerable to measures that “flood” public debate and disrupt shared decentralized understandings of actors and coalitions, in ways that autocracies are not…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3273111">https://ssrn.com/abstract=3273111</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>As they said in <em>Yes, Minister</em>: the opposition is the opposition, but the cabinet member sitting next to you is your enemy:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Matthew Yglesias</strong>: <em>La Dolce Mailbag</em>: ‘People you are ideologically adjacent to are more annoying than people you are deeply distant from, because you view their bad takes as influencing the persuadable.

Not quickly or easily. It takes at least two years to start a fab. And America lacks the talent base and infrastructure that has enabled Taiwan to dominate. As a result, Morris Chang, founder of Taiwan’s dominant TSMC group, says that production in its US TSMC factories costs 50 per cent more than in Taiwan…. Yet, even if it will be tough to shift the supply chain pattern, nobody should doubt that the pendulum is swinging…. The geopolitical chip wars could soon turn even more interesting.
