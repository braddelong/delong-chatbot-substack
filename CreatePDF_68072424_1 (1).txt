FIRST: Monthly CPI Inflation at???... ZERO!

Well, that was a surprise!

Given that Jay Powell let himself get panicked out of his forward guidance into a much bigger 
stomping-on-the-brakes because of a preliminary consumer confidence number that vanished as more 
data came in, will he now allow himself to be guided back to what he was planning to do before he 
freaked? Or would that be too humiliating?
What he should, of course, be watchinga€”and what he says he is watchinga€”is core PCE:

which now stands 2%-points below where it would be had the Federal Reserve actually hit its 2%/year 
inflation target since the Great Recession began. And he should also be watching the 5/5 forward

which shows no signs of inflationary psychology.

Add in a remarkable tightening of financial conditions from January-May, which will put substantial 
drag on the economy next year as its effects hit exports and construction:

I have been on team a€oeorganized crime and public corruptiona€n with respect to Mexicoa€™ s slow 
economic developments’’that it is a bystander casualty in the drug war Americas™ s government wages 
against drug suppliers and Americas™ s own drug-consuming citizens. But I am far from sure. Noah 
Smith highlights the puzzles here:

Noah Smith: Mexico: A Development Puzzle. S^S™ ve been writing a series of development economics 
postsS!. A refinement of the industrial policy ideas of Alexander HamiltonS! has held up pretty 
well. The successful countries havenS™ t followed the Chang/Studwell recommendations to a T. Nor 
have the industrialists been right in all their policy prescriptionsS! Poland and Indonesia,S! 
suggest that foreign direct
investment is a lot more usefula€!. Therea€™ s one major developing country, however, that bucks 
this emerging conventional wisdom in a big way. And ita€™ s the country that people ask me to write 
about most often. So todaya€™ s post is about Mexicoa€!. I dona€™ t want to paint Mexico as a total 
failure or a basket case here. $20,000 (at PPP) is a respectable income, and puts Mexico above the 
global median. Wea€™ re not
talking  about a country like Pakistan, which has stalled at less than a third of Mexicoa€™ s 
income level. Mexico has had real achievements, like increasing literacy steadily to over 95% and 
reducing inequality substantially since the a€~90s. Buta€! Mexico has suffered a growth stagnation 
even while enjoying a ton of natural advantages and using an economic model similar to that of the 
successful countries. What wea€™re looking at
here is a big development mysterya€!. Mexico is a technically sophisticated and highly diversified 
manufacturing nation that makes and exports large volumes of complex, high-value-added goods. That 
is almost always the description of a rich, industrialized country, or at least a fast-growing 
near-rich country like Malaysia or Poland. And yet Mexico is a middle-income country thata€™ s 
growing more like a natural resource
exportera€!. Organized crime is not the only explanation for Mexicoa€™ s slow growtha€!, Gordon 
Hanson has aa€! number of possible factorsa€!. Poor credit supply, Poor infrastructure (especially 
electricity and telecommunications), Chinese competition, Overregulation, Too many informal 
businessesa€!. Therea€™ s no obvious, glaring silver bulleta€!. Mexicoa€™ s case presents a puzzle 
and an anomalya€!. Ita€™ s just one
country,   but ita€™ s an uncomfortable exception that should make development theorists question 
just how much they really know about why countries growa€!

Was functional democracy a rA©gime suited only for the Gutenberg Age? I find this very disturbing:

Ezra Klein & Sean Illing: How We Communicate Will Decide Whether Democracy Lives or Dies'. a€~Ezra: 
Zac Gershberg and Sean Illinga€\ writea€\ d€celtd€™ s better to think of democracy less as a 
government type and more as an open communicative culture .a€\Jd€\ Ia€™ ve become almost obsessed 
in recent years with Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman, the great mida€ “20th century media 
ecologistsa€\. Sean: Wide
open, free expre ssiona€\ is a condition of democracy, [but] it can also be hijacked and turned 
against ita€\.And that tension or that paradox is baked into the structure of democracy a€\. Ezra: 
One of my favorite Postman quotesa€\ a€ reintroduce the alphabet to a culture and you change its 
cognitive habits, its social relations, its notions of community, history and religion. Introduce 
the printing press with movable type and you do the
same. Introduce speed of light transmission of images, and you make a cultural revolution without a 
vote, without polemics, without guerrilla resistance. Here is ideology pure if not serene. Here is 
ideology without words and all the more powerful for their absence. All that is required to make it 
stick is a population that devoutly believes in the inevitability of progress .a€\3
