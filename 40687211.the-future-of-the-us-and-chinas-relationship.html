<p><strong>The Future of the U.S. and China’s Relationship</strong></p><p><strong>J. Bradford DeLong</strong></p><p>August 30, 2021</p><p>&nbsp;China’s growth has created three Chinas—a Spain-level 60-million megacity growth poles, which also possess the world’s second-leading high-tech economy; a Poland-level 300-million coastal economy, which is the world’s largest export manufacturing machine ever (and which is mostly integrated with the rest of the world much more than with China’s interior), and a Peru-level one-billion interior economy, whose performance has been very good by global-south standards, but sub-par by Pacific Rim standards. Coastal China’s growth was hobbled by its lack of experience and institutions, and its consequent need to grab for second-best good-enough practices hobbled it, especially in the interior. But the fact that the technology gap vis-a-vis the outside when coastal China began its ascent was larger than had been the case for the rest of the Pacific Rim was a factor that boosted growth and largely offset that obstacle.</p><p>However, the fact that the billion people in interior China have not managed to experience growth at the standard Pacific Rim pace has important consequences. They are one billion people. They do not feel especially rich. And they do not feel that the coastal-centered economic order of China today is fully working for them. That has consequences: it makes Xi Jinping think that he should try to flatter them by asserting China’s predominance in international affairs. Vladimir Putin’s conquest of the Crimea made him very popular, for a while. Xi Jinping has taken note.</p><p>How should the United States respond to the China we will see in the next several decades? What the U.S. should do is obvious: be its best possible self. As George F. Kennan wrote at the start of the Cold War: “The issue of Soviet-American relations is in essence a test of the overall worth of the United States…. The United States need only measure up to its own best traditions and prove itself worthy. Surely, there was never a fairer test of national quality than this…”</p><p>The question of what the United States will do is more fraught.</p><p>Before Trump, the US’s China policy was: engage and embrace. Work hard so that China would have much more to gain by playing cooperatively with the U.S. than competitively. Establish the Trans-Pacific Partnership to maximize negotiating leverage on issues like IP. Point out that China has a short-run growth problem, a medium-run succession problem, and a long-run legitimacy problem. Point out that Zhao Ziyang was wise in at least trying to think about how to create a party and a space in which the people could be represented to those in the corridors of power so that their livelihood can be advanced. Point out that no system can be good or stable without substantial space and protection for people like Peng Dehuai.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether that was the right policy or not, now, of course, all of this has gone smash.</p><p>In the future, there will be a faction inside Washington that greatly fears the acquisition of monopoly power by Chinese state-directed entities, and it will seek strongly to curb Chinese firms’ footprint in the US. There will be a faction that greatly fears the acquisition by the Chinese government of frontier military technologies, and it will seek strongly to hobble Chinese abilities to draw on products and processes from outside. And there will be a faction that aims for a poor China as an end in itself, as a poor China will not be an attractive model to others, just as there were those who sought a poor Cuba as an end in itself during the Cold War.&nbsp;</p><p>There is unlikely to be a Cold War. There is likely to be a substantial decoupling. And Korea will be caught in the middle.</p>
