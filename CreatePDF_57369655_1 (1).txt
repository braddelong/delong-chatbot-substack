FIRST: Why 20th Century History Was so Different than All Previous History

Briefly: very very roughly, approximately, and inadequately, on average what twenty workers were 
needed to do in 1870 with their eyes, fingers, thighs, brains, mouths, and ears, 1 worker was able 
to do in 2010.

It is also true that what one worker could do in 1870 required 20 in -6000. But that 20-fold 
amplification was an 8000-year creep rather than a 140-year sprint: a proportional growth rate of 
0.04%/year rather than 2.1%/year. And from -6000 to 1870 the overwhelming bulk of the potential 
benefits for humans from that twentyfold upward creep of technological knowledge had been eaten up 
by growing resource scarcity: the land and other natural
resources available to support 1 person in -6000 had to support 400 by 1870.

By contrast, the twentyfold post-1870 technological-progress wave had to deal not with a 200- but 
only a 6-fold multiplication of human numbers, leaving lots to be devoted to bringing about much 
higher average productivity.

Thus over the long 20th century humanity really should have used our collective technological 
prowess to build a Utopia or Utopiasa€“have created, as my friend Max Singer used to say, a truly 
human world. Spoiler: it did not do so. But why not? And is there anything we can do to do better 
in the 21st century? And, if so, what?

If there is one single nugget of insight that I want readers of my book Slouching Towards Utopia 
<https://bit.lv/3pP3Krk> to permanently engrave on their brains, this is it: around 1870 the rate 
of technological progress and thus of potential wealth creation went into much higher gear. After 
1870, humanity's deployed technological capabilities and thus potential prosperity doubled every 
thirty-five yearsa€”and withit came economic creative destruction
that reduced old economic structures to rubble and built new ones, and did it again, and again, and 
again, every single generation. Before 1870? From 1770-1870 humanity's globally-deployed 
technological prowess had a doubling time of about 150 yearsa€”not 35. From 1500-1770 it had a 
doubling time of 500 years. And before 1500, we are looking at a doubling time of 2000 years. The 
difference between our world, in which technological progress
creatively destroys and revolutionizes the economy every 35 years, and the world of Agrarian-Age 
antiquity in which the same proportional changes in technology and economy, and thus in polity and 
society, take not 35 but 2000 years is, I think, a master force shaping human history.

I want to hammer home the obvious to those who don't have exponential growth magnitudes in their 
immediate intellectual panoply: a twentyfold amplification of human technological prowess in 140 
years is a REALLY BIG F—ING DEAL. To get an equivalent proportional jump in the other direction, 
you have to go back from 1870 to the Bronze Agea€” to the year -2000 or so. We are, 
proportionately, as separate in technology from the railroad's
Golden Spike and the first transoceanic cables as those were from the earliest chariots and the 
sculptor of the dancing girl of Mohenjo-Daro:

I agree with Claudia here: I simply do not see the expectational wage-price spiral in the making:

Claudia Sahm: Ita€™ s 2022, not 1972’. a€~The Fed must act to bring inflation down. It is! And it 
has the full support of the White House and Congress. No guarantees of success. Peoplea€™ s beliefs 
can change quickly. Feelings matter. And the world has been cruel the past few years. That said, 
ita€™ s not time to throw in the towel and accept a recession. No!a€! The Feda€™ s thinking and 
actions in the 1970s are not
comparable to the current crisis. We have learned many lessons from the past, and ita€™ s clear 
that Fed officials are applying those lessons as best they can todaya€!

Addendum: This post is an example of me trying to make economics more accessible while sharing my 
expertise. I truly love economics, and my goal is to share that love with others. Above all, I want 
to create space for others to join these discussions, epsecially who do not look like a typical 
economist on the news or in policy circles or who dona€™t have the elite credentials. So yeah, some 
might see me as a€oenot seriousaCD here, but the worst
thing I could do is take myself too seriously. Ita€™ s not about mea€!

Here, for the first time I have seen this year, is a comprehensible argument about how expectations 
of inflation might get entrenched, and thus generate a wage price spiral which would be best 
handled by having more aggressive Fed tightening now. Paul Krugman does not believe it. But he does 
take it seriously. And so do I. The claim that a media-partisan complex is about to brainwash 
gullible Americans in the interests of clickbait and anti-Biden
votesa€”it seems a big stretch to me. But the world is a stange and surprising place:

Paul Krugman: a€~Crucial: [I am] not claiming that consumers or markets have special information. 
The question isna€™t whether theya€™re right; ita€™ s whether inflation has gotten entrenched. All 
the evidence says no. Now, Goldman Sachs is making a curious argument: That inflation expectations 
will rise because of a€cethe coming barrage of political advertisements highlighting high inflation 
ahead of the midterm
electionsa€Da€!. CNN has become the Inflation News Network; and what do you think people see on 
Fox?a€! If partisan ads get more people to tell pollsters that they expect permanent high 
inflation, will this translate into actual wage and price increases? That is, will it affect 
perceptions that inform economic decisions, as opposed to those that might affect voting? Doubtful. 
Wea€™ 11 need to watch this, and maybe discount
what    the surveysa€”as opposed to financial markets, where people are putting money on the 
linea€”say. Key point: the Fed should not slam the brakes because of phantom inflation fearsa€!

I confess it has been a long, long time since the New York Timesa€™ s decision to keep giving Ross 
Douthat has column-inches has made any sense to me. Perhaps it is eleven-dimensional chess? That 
this is the best that a conservative in America in 2022 can do? The key, I think, is that the 
plutocrats and neofascists in the republican party have discovered that their key to political 
success is resisting social-democratic proposals to treat people equally
by aggressively pushing for a society in which people are classified as unequals and then treated 
unequally:

Steve M.: Imagine Therea€™s No Revanchism'. a€~Once again [Ross] Douthat is digging in the dung 
pile of the contemporary right, convinced that there must be a compassionate-conservative pony in 
there somewherea€!. Stop snickering. He really believes this. He thinks ita€™ s actually possible 
that a movement almost monomaniacally devoted to punitive acts will do a 180 and empathetically 
expand aid to poor parents in
the name of conservatisma€!

And, yes, a better world is possible:

Garrison Lovely: Do We Need a Better Understanding of a€~Progressa€™ ?\ a€~Cowen and Collisona€! 
are not content to merely study progress; they want actiona€!. The progress community wants its 
followers to believe that they can do bettera€!. For Crawford, the vision of that world animates 
him: a€oel want humanity to regain its self-esteem and its ambition, to figuratively and literally 
reach for the stars. I want us to
dream of flying cars, fusion energy, nanotech manufacturing, terraforming planets, exploring the 
galaxy. So ita€™ s not just about policy, but about peoplea€™ s fundamental attitudes towards 
humanity and our place in nature. a€D If you fell asleep for another 70 years, might Crawforda€™ s 
world await you? Would you be living a happier, richer life? Perhapsa€!
