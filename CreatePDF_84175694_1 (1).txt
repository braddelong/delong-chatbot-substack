The passage:

Yes, humans have coevolved with culture and geography. Those of us whose ancestors moved far from 
the equator are descended only from those among
the migrants who developed mutations disrupting their melanin-production genes, so that enough 
sunlight could get through the outer layers of the skin to
turn cholesterol into Vitamin D. It looks as though lactose tolerance has evolved six times in the 
past 6,000 years. Yes, we wish right now that whatever
founder effects produced Tay-Sachs disease had not occurred.

Ann McCants writes, correctly, that this is:

a fundamental conceptual errora€!. Coevolution, by definition, means that two forces are in dynamic 
play with each other, that each changes the other
without one being prior. It is conceptually possible that humans have coevolved with their cultures 
in the sense that both might change, even if slowly. But
is  it possible that human change can change geography? So what do you mean here?

I wrote back: It should be a€oeYes, humans have coevolved with culture and migrationa€D, in an 
acknowledgement that breaking the melanin-production genes and doing
everything possible to amp-up the immune system against malaria have very powerful Darwinian 
advantages and have shaped our genes.
