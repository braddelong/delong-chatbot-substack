Providing supple analyses of Keynes’s economic claims, Carter restores the worlds—Cambridge philosophy and morals, Bloomsbury aesthetics, and Whitehall politics—that are embedded in them. While Robert Skidelsky’s three-volume biography remains the touchstone for a full account of Keynes’s life and thought, Carter’s brings the thought to life in a way that is truer to the man. The “master-economist,” wrote Keynes, “must be mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopher,” dealing in “the temporal and the eternal, at the same time.” That is the Keynes Carter gives us...</p></blockquote><p>It is really nice to see continued praise for the truly superb <em>Price of Peace</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525509054/">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525509054/</a>&gt;. But Corey’s review struck me as… extremely odd. Don’t get me wrong: Corey is brilliant. And, from my perspective, he is the exact kind of brilliant to attract my attention and focus—smart, knowledgeable, benevolent, and thinking very differently than I do. He is, needless to say, not an economist.</p><p>Let me try to figure out where the oddness is by trying to reflect Corey’s review in my own native idiom:</p><ol><li><p>Economics—production-for-exchange, and the consequent web of exchange itself—is what binds us into a civilization, and a progressive civilization. <strong>[This seems to me to be right—but I would speak more about it as a generalization and transformation of human gift-exchange as social solidarity-generator, and of Keynes’s… warning?… the economists are the trustees not of civilization but of the possibility of civilization.]</strong></p></li><li><p>The 20th century transformation of the word “economy” to mean not household (or public) stewardship of resources, but rather <em>frugality,</em> had the potential to make it all go wrong, and Keynes sought to understand how and why. <strong>[This is what I read Corey for—I would never have thought of putting it that way. But here I want to say “yes, but”. Keynes starts out his career as a huge fan of frugality in consumption balanced by liberality in investment. And he remains so throughout his life—</strong><em><strong>provided</strong></em><strong>, and this "provided" is very important, that technocratic adjustments are made to the economic system that euthanize the rentiers via the policy of low interest rates and insure that the balance of consumption and investment is maintained via a “somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment”.]</strong></p></li><li><p>Keynes belongs alongside Aristotle, Machiavelli, and Burke, as well as Marx and Smith, as a moral philosopher. <strong>[Well, yes: But Keynes is much more “we have a going concern that needs technocratic adjustment”, as opposed to calling for systemic reformation and rebuilding.]</strong></p></li><li><p>“The great set pieces of Keynesian economics are sketches of failed connection”: the failure to rebuild the Belle Époque system after WWI in 1919, the sacrifice of British prosperity on the altar of the <em>aura sacra fames</em> that was the gold standard in 1925, the high-unemployment equilirium of the Great Depression of the 1930s. These all arise because “knowledge of the social dimension of economic action—that we do not choose alone, that our actions have effects on others—has not yet penetrated our decisions in the market”. It is thus the job of the economist to set things up so that this social knowledge will arise. And this, when appropriate, requires throwing overboard all of <em>economy</em> as “economizing”: “‘We shall never be able to move again, unless we can free our limbs from these paper shackles’, Keynes writes”. <strong>[Again, yes: this is a very good way of putting it that I would not have thought of.]</strong></p></li><li><p>“Keynes’s economics… assigns that art of public thinking not to the statesman or citizen but to the economist and to ordinary economic actors…. Keynes wanted it to shape the mind of the individual as well. Go shopping, he told the ‘patriotic housewives’ of Britain in 1931, ‘and have the added joy that you are increasing employment, adding to the wealth of the country’, and ‘bringing a chance and a hope to Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Belfast’. <strong>[Yes: Keynes wanted to do everything he could to increase the marginal propensity to consume in 1931. But the broader conclusion seems to me to miss the mark: Keynes definitely did not believe in full employment, equilibrium, attained by bottom up mass movement and collective solidarity; it was the central bank that had to create the low interest-rate policy, and it was the government that had to achieve the "somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment”.]</strong></p></li><li><p>“Keynes [also] worried about… how we overconnect… outsourcing our judgments…. The result is a perverse sort of beauty contest in which none of us chooses our favorite contestant but the one we think others are likely to choose. Instead of the equilibrium of self and other that is Smith’s communion of needs, Keynes writes, ‘we have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.’… This was the world that Smith, under the influence of Rousseau, feared the market would reproduce. Rousseau believed that a fateful turn in human development occurred when we gathered in front of huts and under trees to perform for one another.” <strong>[Here I think Corey has gone off the rails: Keynes’s insights into human psychology, our inability to pierce the veil of time and ignorance, and the madness of crowds in the stock market and in booms and bubbles more generally are his own. Thet have next to nothing to do with Rousseau's discourses on natural goodness, healthy civilizational virtue, and corruption by luxury and performance.]</strong></p></li><li><p>“Increase in temporal distance and the introduction of the far-off future as a factor in our calculations [means] money becomes a more potent concern. A monetary economy is not simply an economy in which money is a factor of exchange…. Because we have little certainty about what the future will bring, we fall back on… a socially approved way of thinking about the future…. Many economic decisions in a monetary economy press us to cede our personal judgments and allow others to do the judging for us…. At certain moments, particularly of crisis or change, the uncertainty of the future is revealed and the flimsiness of these conventions is exposed. The quiet precarity of our judgment gives way to a roaring river of anxiety…. This analysis of the toxic synergy between money and time is easily the most influential and familiar of Keynes’s arguments.” <strong>[And now he is back on track.]</strong></p></li></ol><p>I am goinbg to ahve to think hard about this: Is Corey making connections that had escaped me?

As such, no company is more singularly important to the global economy than TSMC…. China’s dependence on Taiwanese chips has served as a form of deterrence and protection for Taiwan, because the Chinese government simply cannot seize the island’s highly sensitive chip-manufacturing facilities by force. While some observers worry that China may regard TSMC as a reason in itself to take Taiwan, TSMC chair Mark Liu has pointed out that a war would inevitably <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/08/tsmc_founder_globalization/">destroy</a> TSMC’s fabs or render them inoperable. Still, TSMC finds itself caught in the middle of a great-power competition…. China will almost certainly fall behind in the semiconductor race, because it lacks access to the lithography machines needed to manufacture the most advanced chips. Nonetheless, it is likely to dominate the market in <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/CHIPS-Act-leaves-chipmakers-facing-choice-between-U.S.-and-China">legacy chips</a> (those ranging from 28 to 44 nanometers)…. TSMC’s goal remains the same: to maintain its status as the unrivaled industry leader. To do so, it will have to play a smart long game. That means making necessary sacrifices in its Chinese business, pacing itself with new investments and diversification overseas, and ultimately keeping its most advanced chips in Taiwan…. Ensuring that Taiwan’s economy, trade, and technology supply chains are resilient and less dependent on China is in America’s vital interest.
