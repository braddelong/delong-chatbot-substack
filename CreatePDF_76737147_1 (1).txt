The whining of the rich

by Michael O'Hare

I came upon this truly amazing pasticcio of mendacity, ignorance, and small-minded cupiditya€!. The 
author is a law professor, not some high-school dropout Limbaugh
lemming, and because the tone of entitlement and whining is typical of a fair number of the 
comments I got on my post about intergenerational equitya€!. Because Obama
proposes  to let the Bush tax cuts expire only on a€oeincomes above $250Ka€D, I was surprised that 
Prof. Henderson expected to be importantly worse off under the
presidents™    s plan, so I went here and plugged in what seemed to be reasonable numbersa€L $5000 
in charitable deductions, and a 5% mortgage on a million-dollar house,
which    is what would cost about $15K in property tax per year in Chicago, with 20% down [thanks 
JHA]: $40,000 per year in mortgage interests!. He says heS™ s paying
Soenearly $100,000S3 in state and federal taxes, not including sales tax; letS™ s say $95,000. 
Leaving out his property tax, thatS™ s $80,000 in income tax. How much
income would lead to this kind of tax hit?S! His pretax family income exceeds $250,000 by at least 
$90,000. But this doesnS™ t include tax-free contributions to their 401Ks:
anything they are socking away for retirement adds to his actual income; unless theyS™ re at the 
$33,000 limit they must just like to pay taxes, or are too stupid to be walking
around professing and treating sick kids. So weS™ re pretty close to $400K gross income, and on top 
of that their employers are surely putting money into their retirement
fundsS!.

He is also whining about his and his wifeS™ s education loans, $500,000, which are costing them 
about $50K per year in interest. LetS™ s just sketch out the family budget here:
Taxes $100,000. Housing $65,000 mortgage + 15,000 insurance & maintenance = $80,000. Two really 
nice cars $.70/mile x 15,000** miles = $10,500. Student loan payments (20
year amortization at 10%) = $60,000S!.

This leaves about $90,000, a lousy $245 a day, for food, clothes, vacations, cable TV, and like 
that. You can walk into NordstromS™ s on Upper Michigan and spend that in a
minute, and for stuff you really need. Really, I donS™t know how these people get by; their 
adaptive skills, economical habits, and modest living style is an inspiration to all of
us. Perhaps they are careful to tip no more than 15% at the Sizzler when they splurge.

So how does our third-of-a-million-a-year law prof/doctor couple and their three kids, barely 
scraping by already and falling before our eyes to the very bottom of the top 1% of US
families by income, make out under ObamaS™ s rapacious soak-the-rich commie attack on all that is 
holy and American and fine? Wait for it; take a guess before the jump:

His taxes will go down $3700; he can buy one of those ties every two weeks! And this guy is 
threatening to fire the gardener and the house cleaner, take the kid out of art class, turn
off his cell phones, and try to raise competent adults with only basic cable. Prof. Henderson, IS™ 
m ashamed to share my profession with youS!.

The next time you come upon a Chicago law professor in his scuffed Gucci loafers and tattered 
Armani on the sidewalk, holding up his libertarian down-with-government sign and
shaking his tin cup to get his doctor wife and hollow-eyed waifs through another tough week in 
their million-dollar hovel, please donS™ t just walk by. Remember, it could be you.
Be  a mensch: throw a nice shiny 3/8S3 washer and couple of nickel slugs in there, with my 
blessings.
