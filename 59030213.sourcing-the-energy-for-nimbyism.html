Nobody believes that the best use of land is the one that passes the maximum profitability test in the eyes of distant rootless cosmopolites. This does not mean that NIMBYism is a sensible reaction. It is not. But it is a guide to where NIMBYism gets its energy:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Addison del Mastro</strong>: <em>No Housing Please, We’re a Community</em>: ‘[Andy:] “I think part of what people on the right are reacting to… is the apparent tendency on the left to try and eliminate the layers of society between the individual and the federal government… local institution[s]….

The original German phrase in <strong>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels</strong> (1848): M<em>anifesto of the Communist Party</em> &lt;https://oll.libertyfund.org/page/marx-manifest#bourgeois&gt; is “Alles Ständische und Stehende verdampft…”—”all that is solid melts into air…”—everything that firmly exists and all the elements of the society of orders evaporate…”—”all traditional estates and status-markers and all fixed patterns are steamed away…” The left and the right do, however, have different reactions to the coming of market society’s steaming away of all intermediary structures and sources of social power that are not based on property rights recognized by the market economy. The left works to moderate market- (and other-)created wealth inequalities and to give individuals equal entitlements based on their status as citizens. The right works to shore up traditional hierarchies, liberties, privileges, and other sources of social power—no matter how unequal and unfair they may be—in a rearguard action against the solvent of the market economy.</p></li><li><p>It is important to register how bonkers this reaction is. Where a region has become desirable to the wealthy, blocking new development greatly strengthens the forces keeping people of the kinds who used to live there from moving in, and greatly accelerates the pressure on landlords to push those who do not now live there who do not have iron-clad property rights out. Where a region has become undesirable, blocking new infrastructure and retail development accelerates its decline in amenities, and thus eventually accelerates the dissolution of community.</p></li></ol><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/sourcing-the-energy-for-nimbyism?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/sourcing-the-energy-for-nimbyism?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Gideon Rachman</strong>: <em>Ukraine &amp; the Start of a Second Cold War</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/34481fbd-4ca7-4bb3-bef5-e68fefed7438">https://www.ft.com/content/34481fbd-4ca7-4bb3-bef5-e68fefed7438</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Michele Jamrisko</strong>: <em>Has Inflation Peaked?

I think it is properly called: delusions about the character of the moral universe. If it is possible to generate sustained broad-based prosperity through proper monetary policy—if we are wrong to, in the words of Winston Churchill’s private secretary P.J. Grigg:</p><blockquote><p>distrust utterly those economists who have with great but deplorable ingenuity taught that it is not only possible but praiseworthy for a whole country to live beyond its means on its wits and who in Mr. Shaw's description teach that it is possible to make a community rich by calling a penny tuppence, in short who have sought to make economics a <em>vade mecum</em> for political spivs...</p></blockquote><p>—if it is in fact that it is the case that the market on its own gets it wrong and ought to be managed, then one should presumably manage the distribution of wealth as will as the level of total spending, and the fact that the market has rewarded you does not mean that you are worthy of reward. And the thought that you have been unjustly enriched by the market is something that rich people do not wish to think:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Paul Krugman</strong>: <em>The Coming Rage of the Money Hawks</em>: ‘I called inflation wrong last year. Much of current inflation reflects huge price increases in sectors strongly affected either by pandemic distortions or, lately, by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but at this point measures that try to exclude these exceptional factors are also running high…. But the economy is probably cooling off as the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening gains traction…. Furthermore, there is no hint in the data that inflation is becoming entrenched…. Workers expect to see raises of only about 3 percent over the next year, barely above historical norms…. Officials at the Federal Reserve have also noticed…. Monetary hawks are enraged. A few days ago the billionaire investor Bill Ackman attracted a lot of attention with a tweet declaring that markets are crashing because investors don’t believe the Fed will do its job…. To understand…you need to be aware that there is a substantial group of economic commentators who always believe the Fed is printing too much money. They believed this during the depths of the Great Depression; they believed this in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis…. Monetary permahawks are motivated by politics…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/27/opinion/inflation-prices-stagflation.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/27/opinion/inflation-prices-stagflation.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>There is a certain strong disconnect here. The “economic anxiety” that fuels the new (and the old) nationalism is <em><strong>not</strong></em> generated by “multinational corporations that profit from arbitraging artificially low wages and unacceptable labor standards in emerging markets”. It is generated by people’s dislike of the fact that their lives retain stability, their communities remain familiar, their incomes match what they believe they deserve, and even their ability to keep or to find a new good job hinges on their activities being part of a value chain that satisfied some maximum-profitability test administered by some rootless cosmopolite who may be thousands of miles away. Claiming that it is “multinational corporations” and “trade deals” rather than the entire neoliberal capitalist order of which those are a small part almost surely leads to destructive protectionism. </p><blockquote><p><strong>Daron Acemoglu</strong>: <em>Understanding the New Nationalism</em>: ‘The post-Cold War project of globalization also created the conditions for resurgent nationalism around the world. With their international credibility at low ebb, Western policymakers will need to rethink how they engage economically and politically with countries that have embraced it…. Many of the affected countries have historical grievances…. Globalization… deepen[ed] inequalities in many countries (often in unfair ways, by enriching those with political connections); it also eroded longstanding traditions and social norms…. Political leaders have become increasingly skilled and unscrupulous in exploiting nationalism…. Trade arrangements must no longer be dictated by multinational corporations that profit from arbitraging artificially low wages and unacceptable labor standards in emerging markets…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-nationalism-three-factors-reaction-to-globalization-by-daron-acemoglu-2022-06">https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-nationalism-three-factors-reaction-to-globalization-by-daron-acemoglu-2022-06</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Absolutely beautifully said. +∞!:</p><blockquote><p><strong>John Ganz</strong>: <em>A Real War</em>: ‘The great irony is how often “realism” ends up being attack on actual reality: in place of the concrete, historical reality, it tells us there are permanent, abstract forces at play: all states are always at all times seeking “power” or some such constant. The existence of these constants, the inevitability of power-seeking, war, self-interest, makes what is actually happening before our eyes into something else: we are not seeing… cities destroyed… children being burned, instead we are seeing a “proxy war” or “a great power struggle.” To focus on what we are actually seeing makes us dangerous sentimentalists, but to see the great forces behind all of it, that makes us good, hard-headed “realists.”… Cynicism is also democratic in its way: it makes everyone who can adopt a cynical attitude, which costs nothing at all, feel like they are devilishly clever, too, sharing the same state secrets as the high ministers: “it’s really all about X.” But the war has a concrete reality and it’s made up of bombs, shells, tanks, and bullets. The physical reality of the war is this: the farther, in terms of ground, the Russian forces advance the more they more they will shell, the more they will burn, the more they will massacre, and the more they will rape. The more Ukrainian territory they occupy, the more opportunity for atrocity…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:58969157,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://johnganz.substack.com/p/a-real-war&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:112019,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Unpopular Front&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e2ad597-1a1e-4c5b-be30-d37b49502770_1224x1224.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Real War&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;“The fact is, people have lost all remembrance of a real war.

It doesn’t take a village. It takes only a tiny amount of resources, applied at the right time in the right way. And applied by the right people. All honor and praise to “Sustainable Transformation of Youth in Liberia”!  </p><p>Of course, the great worry is that something that works extremely well when it is a work of <em><strong>charisma</strong></em> will turn into an unproductive money-sink when it becomes a work of <em><strong>bureaucracy</strong></em>. One of the secrets of the large bureaucratic modern corporation as it developed in 1870 was its grasping of the mysteries of how to scale without losing too much of the efficiencies and energies. But the lessons are very hard to apply across different scopes:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sigal Samuel </strong>: <em>Liberia’s Stunningly Effective Way to Reduce Shootings &amp; Other Crimes</em>: ‘Chris Blattman, Margaret Sheridan, Julian Jamison, and Sebastian Chaskel…. Johnson Borh… showed him around the capital city of Monrovia. Since Blattman studies crime and violence, Borh took him to visit the pickpockets, drug sellers, and others living on the margins of society. Along the way, they kept running into guys who were sitting on street corners, eking out a meager living by shining shoes or selling clothes. When these men spotted Borh, they’d run to give him a hug. Blattman recalls that when he asked the men how they knew Borh, they’d say something like, “I used to be like them,” and point to the nearby pickpockets or drug sellers. “But then I went through Borh’s program.” That’s how Blattman learned about the program Borh had been running for 15 years: Sustainable Transformation of Youth in Liberia. It offered men who were at high risk for violent crime eight weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT, as it’s called, is a popular, evidence-based method of dealing with issues like anxiety, but Borh adapted the therapeutic strategy to deal with issues like violence and crime…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23141405/violence-crime-cbt-therapy-cash-shootings">https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23141405/violence-crime-cbt-therapy-cash-shootings</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>SUBJECT: Project Syndicate Column Draft</h2><h3><strong>What Should, &amp; What Will the Federal Reserve Do on Thursday?</strong></h3><p>On Wednesday and Thursday June 15 and 16, the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee has one of its two-day meetings &lt;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcpresconf20210616.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcpresconf20210616.htm</a>&gt;.

The Federal Reserve does not want to hit its inflation target year-by-year. It wants to maintain confidence in the economy's nominal price-level anchor. As long as that confidence is retained, the Federal Reserve has short-run policy freedom to do whatever is needed to maximize employment and growth. And deviating from forward guidance by raising interest rates faster than it had planned—hitting the economy on the head with a brick to reduce demand for and thus employment and growth in the construction, export, and import-competing sectors—definitely does not maximize employment and growth.</p><p>The first question is harder to answer. Right now bond-market expectations are, extracting what we think are duration risk premiums, for the Federal Funds rate to average about 2.75% per year over the next two years and about 2.5% per year over the next ten. Starting from where we are now, that suggests an expectation that the Federal Reserve will raise the Federal Funds rate to 3.5% over the course of the next year, hold it there, and then put it on a gradual glide path down to perhaps 2%—until something else happens to the macroeconomy. That would be three 0.5%-point interest-rate increases and four 0.25%-point interest rate increases over the next seven meetings. I would very much prefer that the Federal Reserve not dribble its interest-rate increases out in a manner that leaves people without firm knowledge about how far it thinks it will ultimately need to go. I think that the best policy is for the Federal Reserve to immediately move the Federal Funds rate to neutral plus-or-minus—plus, if it thinks that demand is higher than is sustainable if the Fed is to maintain the credibility of the nominal inflation anchor in the long run; minus, if it thinks that demand is lower than sustainable.</p><p>The most basic and general of Optimal Control Theory principles is that if your control is not at the optimal level—if the nose of your sailboat is not pointing where you want to go—you should turn the nose as fast as possible, until you don't know whether your next course correction will be to the port or to the starboard. In monetary policy, that would mean that each month the Federal Reserve should change its target so that people do not know whether the next move is up or down. I have heard arguments that this Optimal Control Theory principle does not apply. They have all struck me as word salad. And I have not been able to understand why people think they apply.</p><p>But we go to monetary policy with the Federal Reserve procedures we have. For the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by only 0.25%-points or by zero on Thursday would break its forward guidance in a context in which it really wishes—I really wish—the Federal Funds rate right now were not lower but were considerably higher. There is no argument for doing that. For the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by 0.75% would, if the ground had been prepared, be better. Indeed, were I czar and had the ground been prepared I would call for a 2.0%-point increase in the Federal Funds rate on Thursday to get it to what we think is its optimal level of neutral-plus. But the ground has not been prepared. And breaking forward guidance is a costly thing that is rarely worth doing.</p><p>A 90% chance of a Federal Funds rate up by 0.5%-points on Thursday. A 10% chance of up by 0.75%-points.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>
