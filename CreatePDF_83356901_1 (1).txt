The passage is:

Once German dreams of a swift victory were dashed, and everyone went to their trenches, the logic 
of the Prussian way of wara€”if you fail to win
quickly, sue for peacea€”fell out of favor. The German officer corpsa€™ adherence to Tote nr it 
ta€” a willingness to undertake a a€oedeath ridea€Da€”
held sway, so that carrying out senseless orders to the best of onea€™ s ability substituted for 
logica€!

This is much too compressed, to put it politely, as has pointed out to me by Mossy Character, who 
snarked a€oenews to Frederick II, among othersa€D

<http://www.unfogged.com/archives/comments_18157.html>. The a€celogica€D was supposed to be: 1. 
Prussia has no natural defenses and a poor population. 2. Hence if it is
going to win, it must win quickly. 3. Hence the Prussian Way of Wara€”strike first, strike hard, 
strike by surprise, strike from an unexpected direction. 4. The logic of the Prussian
Way of War is that you are going to lose a long war. 5. Therefore if you fail to win quickly, logic 
says sue for peace. 6. But that is not how the German army worked. And then the
next sentence should begin with an a€ceInsteada€!a€D

But none of that comes through in the first edition text.
