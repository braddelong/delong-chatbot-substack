FIRST: Reading Gershberg and Illing: The Paradox of Democracy: Free Speech, Open Media, & Perilous 
Persuasion

I have not yet digested Zac Gershberg & Sean Illing (2022): The Paradox of Democracy: Free Speech, 
Open Media, & Perilous Persuasion <https ://w w w.amazon .com/dp/022668170X>. I do know that when I 
have digested it, I will feel very positively about it, and recommend it highly.
At the moment, however, I just want to register two passages from Seana€™ s appearance on The Ezra 
Klein Show:

Ezra Klein: Trumpa€™ s persuasive effecta€!. He didna€™ t code it in the way that appeals to the 
policy wonksa€!. He persuaded a lot of people in part through the fights he picked, in part through 
who he went after that he was going to represent them, right? That they didna€™ t like immigration 
and nor did he. That they didna€™ t like how this country was changing and nor did he. That they
didna€™t like Democrats and nor did he. But also they didna€™t like George W. Bush and nor did 
hea€!. You persuade people that youa€™re on their sidea€! [if] you come to share their enemiesa€!. 
You have to convince people first and foremost that youa€™re on their side before theya€™re going 
to listen to almost anything else you tell them. And people judge whether youa€™re on their side

not hv the white naners von nut nnt hut hv more fundamental nnsitinnina and temnerament and 
rhnnsina of enemies and nirkinv nf fiohts Tta^™ s whv Ta^™ ve always said that the relevant 
nnestinn isna^™ t whata^™ s nnnnlar that vnna^™ re willina tn sav hut what is nnnnnnlar that 
vnna^™re willina tn sava^l


And

Sean Illing: Media technology todaya€! is actually very different from the pasta€! [and] evolves so 
much faster now. For most of human history, the world you died in looked a lot like the world you 
were born into. And that kind of stability puts culture on a solid footing. Now, I dona€™ t even 
understand what my 13-year-old niece is doing on TikTok. The pace of change is too fast for our 
institutions,
too fast for our culture, and probably too fast for our minds to adjusta€!. We had roughly 200 
years after the printing press without any major revolutions in media technology. And we needed all 
of that time to develop the institutions of modernity. But Ia€™ m not sure we have another 200 
years to adjust to this revolution. And things are going to keep changing at breakneck speed. So I 
dona€™ t know
where that leads us, Ezra, but I do think it means we should expect a bumpy ridea€!

About the first: Ezra Klein is positively Schmittian herea€”Karl Schmittian, that politics is war, 
and that the most important thing is to choose your enemies, and that will then tell you who your 
friends are. That tends to lead in the direction of populist-authoritarianism: fascism (your 
enemies are the rootless cosmopolites, and mongrels, and others who do not feel the identity of the 
true people in their bones) or of really-existing
socialism (your enemies are the bourgeoisie and their supporters). That tends to lead away from 
discussion-based pickup coalition-building: liberal democracy (we have a very good thing going, we 
here together, but we need to improve it) and away from conservative constitutionalism (we have a 
very good thing going, we here together, but we need to restore it). To the extent that politics in 
the age of social media is a politics of
clickbait, outrage, friends, and enemies (rather than a politics of fixing leaks in the roof or 
constructing an addition to our common home) that augers very badly for the future of America.

Now do not get me wrong: in America, the politics of friends and enemies did not emerge with 
TrumpaC™ s use of social media or even Gingricha€™ s use of talk radio. It was always there. 
Consider Herbert Hoover in the late 1950s, in his dotage, still inveighing against THAT COMMUNIST 
ROOSEVELT. Consider Democratic Missouri Thomas Eagleton in 1972a€”about to be chosen as Vice 
Presidential running mate by
Democratic Presidential nominee George McGoverna€’’telling right-wing sleaze artist Robert Novak 
off the record that McGovern was the candidate of a€oeacid, amnesty, and abortiona€D. Consider my 
friend Stuart Kirkpatricka€™ s Jeanne Kirkpatrick at the 1984 Republican National Convention, fed 
by Pat Buchanan the line; a€oeThey always blame America first, those San Francisco 
Democratsa€da€”i.e., not just
commies, but gay as well.

But, in my view at least, before Gingrich there was always a very strong sense that the political 
center-of-gravity was still liberal and conservative^’’working together to fix roof leaks or finish 
the addition, with disagreements as to how to do it best. The Karl Schmittians were, by and large, 
kept in cages from which they were let out for get-out-the-base vote drives.
It was a different time. As never-Trump right-winger Tom Nichols put it:

In the Before Times, we still argued over politics instead of whether communist Muslims had taken 
over our Venezuelan voting machines with help from the Italian space program. I felt like it was 
safe to throw elbows and do some partisan high-sticking; I believed that we were all in a giant 
bouncy house called the Constitution, a place where we might bump skulls or sprain an ankle now and 
then but
where there were no sharp edges and there were only soft landings. I dona€™ t believe that 
anymorea€!

The Constitution Is a Mass Delusion

Nichols sees the change as coming with Trump. I see it as coming two decades earlier, with 
Gingrich. And I see it as well-cemented by the early 2000s, when Andrew Sullivan could make a 
career out of how-great-it-is-to-lie-to-own-the-libs! things like:

The Krugmans and the Chaits will shortly have a cow, if not a whole herd of them. The Times will 
weigh in again with yet another barrage of articles, editorials, and op-eds opposing any tax 
reliefa€!. Controlling government spending is simply impossible without deficitsa€!. Some 
commentatorsaCI get steamed because Bush has obscured this figure or claimed his tax cut will cost 
less than it actually
willa€!. These arguments have merita€”but they miss the deeper point. The fact that Bush has to 
obfuscate his real goals of reducing spending with the smoke screen of a€oecompassionate 
conservatisma€n shows how uphill the struggle isa€!. A certain amount of B.S. is necessary for any 
vaguely successful retrenchment of government power in an insatiable entitlement stateaC!

Immigrants settle in places where there is opportunity, immigrants move to places where there is 
opportunity, immigrant parentsa€™ incomes, and occupations may well not reflect their high 
non-English human capital that they infuse into their children, and immigrants are more willing to 
move not just place but occupation as well. Painting, with a very broad brush, that is why 
immigrantsa€™ children are upwardly mobile in
America. And that is why third-generation Americans see America as, overwhelmingly, working for 
them and their families:

Leah Boustan: Interview by Noah Smith: a€~Immigrants take steps to a€~fit ina€™ just as much today

integration, both economically and culturallya€! are actually the group that experiences the

than other

geography. Immigrants tended to settle in dynamic citiesa€!. We suspect that educational 
differences between groups matter todaya€!

Oh boy. This is not good news, not good news at all. The amount by which the bond market now 
expects the Fed to overshoot tightening and be frantically trying to fight recession next year. 
It's some thing I find truly disturbing. It is not just that the bond market disagrees with the Fed 
as both fallibly attempt to peer through the veils of time and ignorance. It is also that the bond 
market's expectations can quickly turn into self-
fulfilling prophecy:

Policy Tensor: The Yield Curve Is Predicting Much Worse than a Recession:. a€~the 6moa€“3mo spread 
shows that the market expects the Fed to already start cutting rates in 2022Q4a€!. This is 
astonishing. The disagreement with the Feda€™ s dot plot diplomacy could not be more obvious. The 
market has essentially rejected the feda€™ s model of the world. The Fed is wrong, it is saying, 
after
driving the economy into recession, youa€™ 11 be cutting in a few monthsa€!. The yield curve is now 
saying rates will be close to the zero lower-bound in 2023a€!. The yield curve is pricing a 
prolonged period of poor expected returns on duration risk assetsa€!. Long-term return expectations 
on risk assets are now so poor that you can get negative rates on bondsa€!. Note that the 5yl0y did 
not invert
when the short end was pricing recession in 2019. Clearly, the market now reckons that long-term 
prospects have deteriorated in a way it did not in 2019a€!. Wea€™re seeing a a€oedouble 
inversion,a€D with both 5yl0y and 2y5y inverteda€!

This serves as a good index of how much Milton Friedmana€™ s redefinition of a€oeneutral monetary 
policya€D to mean a€oewhatever monetary policy keeps nominal GDP on its trend growth patha€D led 
people prone to motivated reasoning in a laissez-faire direction completely and horribly astray. It 
also serves as an example of an astonishing failure to mark onea€™ s beliefs to market. Never mind 
that the rough constant

of M2 velocity before 1980 had been an obvious example of Goodharta€™ s Law. Never mind that even 
before 1980 forecasts of the state of the economy one and two years out based on M2 were inferior 
to other forecast. By 1997 James Buchanan had just seen a remarkable five-year 30% runup in M2 
velocity, and the complete ditching of monetary aggregates not just as targets but even as 
indicators by Alan Greenspan in favor
of a neo-Wicksellian a€oeneutral interest ratea€D approach that had nothing whatsoever to do with 
an a€oeeffective monetary constitutiona€D of any type. And yet Buchanan clings to his conviction 
that the market system was failed in the Great Depression because had its a€oemonetary 
constitutiona€D been sound, it would have been impossible for there to have been anything like the 
Great Depression:

James Buchanan: Has Economics Lost Its Way?’. a€™ IV. The Keynesian Aberrationa€!.. The Keynesian 
enterprise can be interpreted as an ultimately failed attempt to jury-rig improvements on a 
structure of institutional constraints that were nonsustainablea€! an aberrationa€! grounded in 
rather elementary misunderstanding ofa€! the classical visiona€!. Who could expect that a€~the 
marketa€™
could adjust quickly to a dramatic reduction in the politically-influenced and unpredictable supply 
of money? It must remain forever mysterious as to why Keynes and the Keynesians were willing to 
neglect prospects for institutional reforms in the effective monetary constitution, while, at the 
same time, proposing radical changes along other more specific dimensions of policya€! politicized 
controls over
particular choice vectors (employment, investment)a€!

Linker:

Damon Linker: Thinking About Fascisma€”Part 2 : a€~When it comes to political rhetoric, Trumpa€™ s 
most fasc-ish moment probably came in his a€oeAmerican Carnagea€D inaugural addressa€! A country in

leadershipa€”and then presents himself as the nationa€™ s savior, giving the government back to

peoplea€D so the country can pursue its a€oeglorious destiny.a€Da€l What would it take for me to 
pronounce them outright fascists? Probably something like Trump running for president in 2024 with 
paramilitaries by his side and violence regularly erupting at his rallies; the candidate openly 
calling for repression of groups (like undocumented immigrants) and deploying lies about the stolen 
2020
election as a a€oestabbed in the backa€D myth to demonize the opposing party (and insufficiently 
loyal members of his own party) as traitors; and the candidate promising, among other things, to 
gut the federal bureaucracy and replace it with cronies vetted for personal loyalty alonea€!
