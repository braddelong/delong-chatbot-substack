GENEVIEVE SCHIFFRAR; COURTESY OF BRAD DELONG

Ita€™ s the best of (economic) times and the worst of (economic) times.

Thata€™ s the argument in Slouching Toward Utopia, out Tuesday by J. Bradford DeLong, the UC 
Berkeley economist, former Clinton White House official, and old-school member of the economic 
blogosphere (dating all the way back to the late 1990s.)

Forget about the a€oelong 19th century ,a€D DeLong argues. Thata€™ s the theory made famous by Eric 
Hobsbawm, who The New Yorker profiled in 2019 as a€oethe communist who explained history.a€D The 
pivotal period in world history occurred from the American and French Revolutions of the late 1700s 
to the first World War in 1914, Hobsbawm argued.

To hear DeLong tell it, Hobsbawm just didna€™ t live long enough to see himself proven wrong, as 
DeLonga€™ s a€oelong 20th centurya€D from 1870 to 2010 was a period of unsurpassed economic growth. 
The problem, DeLong says, is thata€™ s been over now for more than a decade and the global economy 
might never recapture its momentum. Humans got closer to utopia than ever before, but wea€™ ve been 
slouching toward it for too long.



AN ECONOMIC HISTORY


He sat down with Fortune ahead of his booka€™ s release to talk about whether the economya€™ s best 
days are behind us, or if we are doomed to live in a dystopia full of killer robots flying through 
the air, scorching summer temperatures wrought by climate change, and, to paraphrase Allen Ginsberg 
(DeLong loves economic paraphrases, as the title of his book indicates), the best technical minds 
of the world turned to selling ads by figuring out how to
scare people.

But he says he still believes that the United States is the a€cefurnace where the future is being 
forged.a€D

The following interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Congratulations on your book and thank you for taking the time after walking your dog.

Yes, we got two dogs during the plague year. Ita€™ s very good to have the daily exercise of 
dog-walking: Ita€™ s an effective way of gaining and outsourcing additional willpower.

Ia€™ve been a reader of yours for a long time, and you have always had this unique style among 
economic writers.

I personally really love this book, because I have long been a big fan of Eric Hobsbawm and his 
concept of the a€oelong 19th century.a€D When did you first read him?

I first came across Hobsbawm when [former Harvard economics professor] David Landes made me read 
them back when I was an undergraduate, around 1980 or so. Landes would say, a€oel dona€™ t really 
recommend left-wing students read Hobsbawm, because hea€™ stoo convincing, but youa€™re enough of a 
right winger that it will annoy you, but also teach you and youa€™re reallythe kind of person who 
ought to read this.a€D
Well, thinking about the long 19th century, you have democracy and industry starting off together 
in the middle of the 1700s, and then the globalized industrial revolution with steam, the 
industrial economy changing to coal and oil, and empire. Thatthen takes you upto 1914 and the 
catastrophe thatstarts there. The arc of those three books is, Ithink, quite wonderful and 
extremely successful. Especially    the first two.

Your a€oelong 20th centurya€D runs from 1870 to 2010, when the world had a burst of economic 
progress that you say is now over, thus proving Hobsbawm wrong. So is it really over?

In 1870, the last institutions fall into place to produce technology that doubles every generation, 
thus enabling Schumpeterian creative destruction in which the next generation is twice as rich, but 
also a huge chunk of industries, occupations and patterns of life vanish in order to make that 
happen, and that makes a lot of people angry. Whatever running code of societal organization you 
crafted, the forces of production as they existed at any moment after
1870, those no longer work 30 or 40 years later, and you have to build new and different patterns 
and institutions on the fly. And thata€™ s a very hard task, and ita€™ s now very hard.

As for when it ends, you could say between 2001 and 2003, when the George W. Bush administration 
says the United States is no longer the benevolent, hegemonic, technological pioneer, wea€™re just 
another country and wea€™re going to follow our own interests.
You could say 2006, when my friend John Fernald says it becomes clear that information technology 
is actually not going to be as big a deal for most people as electrification or the internal 
combustion engine or modern materials.

You could say ita€™ s 2007, when the idea that you actually needed to manage finance because it 
wasna€™ t trustworthy on its own turned out to be nonexistent.

Or you could say 2010, at a time when standard Keynesian theory would say the private sector has 
sat down on spending and the government sector needs to stand up, and even Barack Obama is saying 
no, the government must tighten its belt, and if the Democratic Congress actually passes any 
spending bills, Ia€™ m going to veto them.
You could also say ita€™ s 2016 with the election of Donald Trump. And if I had to write it over 
again, I would say therea€™ s a case for saying ita€™ s 2022, with the return of major power war 
[between Russia and Ukraine].

But sometime between 2002 and 2020 the whole complex of things that gave us the long 20th century 
a€’’this technologically progressive, globalized United States, the furnace where the future was 
being forgeda€”dissolves piece by piece, and it leaves us in a new world in which China and India 
are likely superpowers and in which dealing with global warming is likely to become all important.

You know, you go around the world and ask about Xi Jinping and hear back that he may have some 
rough edges, but at least hea€™ s been tested as a competent administrator and someone who listens 
to advice, as opposed to the ethnonationalist politicians being thrown up by the industrial 
democracies right nowa€”Trump was no prize and Boris Johnson was no prize. Thata€™ s a very strange 
configuration of things. And people have not quite wrapped
their minds around this new world yet.

Another part of this new configuration is the high inflation wea€™ve been experiencing. What are 
people not wrapping their minds around with this highest inflation in 40 years?

On inflation, my view was that we were going to have some coming out of the plague. And it was 
going to be by and large, a good thing.

Let me explain: The plague has given us maybe 15 years of metaverse-style technological development 
in just over two years. And the economy has a new configuration: Fewer in-person workers in retail 
establishments, a lot more delivery orders, substantially more goods production, and also 
substantially more information entertainment and production as well. That requires that we shift a 
lot of people into new jobs, and you cana€™ t cut anyonea€™ s
wages nominally without making them extremely angry at you, which means that in the expanding 
sectors, you have to raise wages in order to pull people into what are the growth sectors of the 
post-plague economy, and thata€™ s going to give us a bunch of inflation.

Plus, when you reopen the economy, you discover all the supply-chain bottlenecks, and you need the 
prices of things where there are bottlenecks to go up in order to get people focused on how do we 
produce more of this stuff or how do we use less of it?

Plus, when you reopen the economy, you discover all the supply-chain bottlenecks, and you need the 
prices of things where there are bottlenecks to go up in order to get people focused on how do we 
produce more of this stuff or how do we use less of it?

Your book is called Slouching Towards Utopia because you describe how we made so much progress in 
the 20th century and then stalled out, but now that we have gone through this accelerated metaverse 
evolution, do you think in a way wea€™ve sprinted towards a new kind of economic utopia, coming out 
of the plague?

I wrote in my book that I saw the best technical minds of the world turned to selling ads by 
figuring out how to scare people, so their eyeballs stayed glued to the screen.
And they figured out how we can use the screen youa€™re looking at to hack your brain so that you 
keep watching so we can sell you more ads.

So do you see this as a dystopia that we have emerged into?

It certainly has dystopian elements. Technological progress always has dystopian elements implicit 
in it, of which large-scale thermonuclear war is only one, and now we are also cooking the 
planeta€”how hot is it in Beijing today? Is reaching 120 degrees or so a normal climate kind of 
thing? We have gotten extremely good at advancing our technology but extremely poor at using it to 
build a proper socioeconomic political system that makes us happy.
We also shouldna€™ t underestimate the fact that while three-quarters of the world went to bed 
seriously hungry in 1870, now ita€™ s only about one-fifteenth of the world that does so today. 
Ita€™ s a huge accomplishment when one of your chief mental concerns is where am I going to get my 
food tomorrow, rather than which of the 93 things I might want tomorrow should I pick up at the 
supermarket?

But revealed political preferences are that this does not make people happy or satisfied or 
thinking that things are going well.

So is it possible to recapture our momentum with economic progress, or is that asking the wrong 
question? It sounds like we still have a lot of progress, but youa€™re describing a crisis of 
values about how that technological progress is used.

Well, we certainly could recover our momentum.

The nice thing about invention is that two heads are not twice as good as one, but two heads are 
far better than that. And now the potential of the scientists and engineers that we could deploy, 
if we really wanted to, is absolutely enormous. Yes, the low-hanging fruit has been picked and 
ita€™ s getting harder and harder to push the technological frontier forward. But our resources are 
still immense and they still scale.

There are people, my colleague and neighbor Fred Block among them, who think that one of the big 
things my book misses is the neoliberal turn in the United States that pushed corporations toward 
declaring maximum short-term profits, which means all the Xerox Parcs and the IBM Labs and the Bell 
Labs were essentially dismantled, and business started saying, instead of doing research, just 
figure out how to make what wea€™re making 1% cheaper
next year. And the loss of those semi-public industrial research lab organizations^’’which because 
they were research-oriented were for the benefit of all, but were inside corporations and actually 
focused on technologies that might worka€”has been a huge minus and a major cause of the slowing 
down of technological progress.

Another huge cause of the slowdown is our failure to keep expanding education. When my father went 
to Harvard in 1955, it admitted 900 men and 300 women. Now it has 700 men and 900 women. Thata€™ s 
only gone up from 1,200 to 1,600 in total over 65 years, not a huge increase in capacity in a 
country thata€™ s much more than doubled in size and in a world in which maybe five times more 
people are qualified for an Ivy League education. That
failure to scale is really quite remarkable and amazing.

The problems with education at the private level are very much the NIMBYism, that is the not 
expanding capacity. At the public school level, ita€™ s simply that we seem to be pretty good at 
what we do at teaching people things and preparing them for lives in which they appear to be very 
productive, but we have no idea how we do it. We really have zero idea about what parts of the 
educational process are useful. What are we doing that is simply a
medieval ritual that was a response a long time ago to bad educational technology, and what things 
actually encourage people to think and talk and acquire skills so they can then better understand 
and deal with the world? American education is still an attractive thing to people from all over 
the world, but it needs to be reformed and we have very little idea of how to reform it. So ita€™ s 
a big puzzle.

And understanding NIMBYism, the a€oenot in my backyarda€D mentality, comes from how the creative 
destruction process indeed destroys a lot of things. But we five in a market economy where the only 
rights that really matter are property rights. And if you have property rights, then you tend to 
think you should have a voice about the surrounding built and natural environment not being changed 
without your buy-in, or at least without you getting
bought off in some way.

Huge numbers of people are tremendously offended at the Biden student loan relief plan, but whoever 
we are, we have all had more than $20,000 of good or bad luck affect our lifetime income paths. 
There are a lot of people who went to school, and then with the totally crappy labor market of the 
past 15 years, it really didna€™ t pay off. So if your principal reaction is that those people are 
getting something they dona€™ t deserve, that shows a very
powerful thing about human psychology.

Also, many people do not like creative destruction at all. The idea that your job or your industry, 
the fabric of your life, might blow away if some rootless Cosmopolis decides the business you work 
for no longer satisfies a maximum profitability test gets people very angry. These things have been 
animatingprogressand its effect on politics eversince the daysof William JenningsBryan.

Well thata€™s quite a note to end on, a reminder that these are not new concerns even if they feel 
that way, and that creative destruction versus NIMBYism is a major issue to resolve.

What I hope is that a lot of younger people read my book. When you get to my generation, you look 
around and ita€™ s by and large a retrospective on what went wrong while we were supposedly in 
control. And Ia€™ d like the younger generation to have a stronger sense of how this kind of 
conflict between property rights and other rights on the one hand, in an environment of repeated 
creative destruction, on the other hand, has greatly hobbled our
ability to actually use our huge technological powers to build a kind of human world as opposed to 
a world in which Beijinga€™ s temperature reaches 120 degrees Fahrenheit and in which right now, 
killer robots are flying in the skies above Ukraine looking for people to kill.

You know, back when I was 12 or 13, there was a difference between the utopian science fiction 
novels with amazing technological competence and virtual reality and so forth, and the dystopian 
science fiction novels in which you had excessive heat from the greenhouse effect and killer 
robots, and yet it turns out inreal life those have becomesomething like the same thing.Yeah. We 
have managed to purchase both.

Wow, well that really sums it up. I just want to say I read your book and I devoured it. I really 
loved it.

Thank you. Oh, thata€™ s excellent. Thata€™ s excellent. I remember [UC Berkeley colleague and 
former Obama advisor] Christina Romer saying, a€oeWow, this is actually readable.a€D And the more 
people who say that, the happier I am.
