Yonatan Zunger: Tolerance Is Not a Moral Precept. The Title of This Essay Should Disturb You: a€~As 
with any peace treaty, we must consider toleration in the broader context of
the war which is its alternative, and we must recognize that peace is not always a possibilitya€!. 
Among the worst wars of tolerance were the religious wars which tore through
Europe between 1524 and 1648a€!. Protestants and Catholics each seeing the other as existential 
threatsa€!. These wars came to an enda€! each ruler had the right to choose the
religion                                                                               of their 
state, and that Christians living in principalities where their faith was not the established faith 
still had the right to practice their religion. A decision was made, in
essence, to accept the risk of the monster rather than the reality of the wara€!. Tolerance, viewed 
as a moral absolute, amounts to renouncing the right to self-protection; but viewed
as a peace treaty, it can be the basis of a stable society. Its protections extend only to those 
who would uphold it in turn. To withdraw those protections from those who would
destroy it does not violate its moral principles; it is fundamental to them, because without this 
enforcement, the treaty would collapse. It is appropriate, even ethical, to answer force
with proportional force, when that force is required to restore a just peace. We seek peace because 
on the whole it is far better than war; but as history has taught us, not every peace
is better than the war it preventsa€! LINK:

is clearly the least bad. That does not mean it is easy to operate.
It is quite likely that the monetary policy needed to generate maximum employment and stable 
inflation is consistent with all sorts of crazy activity in the financial
system. We are surely seeing plenty of that now. But no sane central bank would deliberately create 
recessions in order to save finance from itself. Rather, it must save
the economy from finance by tough regulation, especially of leveragea€! LINK:

Yuval Noah Harari: Lessons from a Year of Covid: a€~ Automation and digitalisation have had an even 
more profound impact on services. In 1918, it was unthinkable that offices,
schools, courts or churches could continue functioning in lockdowna€!. The switch online has many 
drawbacks, not least the immense mental tolla€!. In 1918, humanity inhabited
only  the physical world, and when the deadly flu virus swept through this world, humanity had no 
place to run. Today many of us inhabit two worlds a€” the physical and the
virtual. When the coronavirus circulated through the physical world, many people shifted much of 
their lives to the virtual world, where the virus couldna€™ t followa€!

Warren Buffett: Letter to Shareholders: a€~Most of Berkshirea€™ s value, however, resides in four 
businessesa€!. The largest in value is our property/casualty insurance
operationa€!. [Our] financial strength, coupled with the huge flow of cash Berkshire annually 
receives from its non-insurance businesses, allows our insurance companies to safely
follow  an equity-heavy investment strategy not feasible for the overwhelming majority of insurers. 
Those competitors, for both regulatory and credit-rating reasons, must focus on
bonds. And bonds are not the place to be these daysa€!. Risky loans, however, are not the answer to 
inadequate interest ratesa€!. Berkshire now enjoys $138 billion of insurance
a€cefloata€Da€’’funds that do not belong to us, but are nevertheless ours to deploya€L Our second 
and third most valuable assetsa€! are Berkshirea€™ s 100% ownership of
BNSF,    Americaa€™ s largest railroad measured by freight volume, and our 5.4% ownership of Apple. 
And in the fourth spot is our 91% ownership of Berkshire Hathaway Energy
(a€ceBHEa€D)a€! a very unusual utility business, whose annual earnings have grown from $122 million 
to $3.4 billion during our 21 years of ownerships!

Cat Rambo: Opinion: More Fuel for the Recent Baenfire: a€~The GoHs are the literal faces of the 
convention, smiling out from the convention advertising and program booksa€!
DisCon had to aska€! Is supporting a place where a bunch of people spend their time expressing 
their hatred of other members of the F&SF community something that makes a
field  more awesome? as well as What do we do, knowing that a choice to keep Weisskopf will be read 
as an endorsement of those words? Words that support an armed coup. Words
saying people with differing political beliefs should be killed. Words urging violence towards 
other peoplea€!. Baen cannot disavow responsibility for those words, regardless of
whether or not they happened because someone was asleep at the wheel. One of the reasons a business 
cannot ignore the importance of moderating any boards that they run is that
they  are responsible for the words posted on there. They cana€™t just turn over the keys to the 
car and say a€oedrive this where you like.a€n Theya€™re still enabling that car to
bounce along the highway, swerving to hit any pedestrian it suspects of being from a particular 
groupa€L When you are a leader, whether you like it or not, you are responsible for
what  is happening under your leadership, whether youa€™re aware of it or not, because thata€™ s 
part of the rolea€!. Baen can continue as it hasa€! [with] a€oehatea€™ s a good
marketing strategy,a€D which may be savvy capitalism but I personally think equates with ethical 
bankruptcya€!. My hope is, that with time and the rise of generations that have
seen   this approach and how hollow it is, hate will stop being so popular. I, for one, hail our 
new Tiktok and Hive overlords exercising the most punk attitude of all: kindness. Or
Baen cana€! work to appeal to a wide range of readers, some of whom are being driven off by the 
current rhetoric being encouraged there on the forums the company sponsors and
runs. Thata€™ s not a novel approach. Most publishers actually choose this onea€!

Enrique Dans: Twelve Things Ia€™ve Learned After A Year Of Video Conferencing: a€~Zoom is by far 
the besta€!. Virtualize your camera: regardless of the software you use,
virtualize your camera. Always. Ita€™ s probably what makes the biggest difference. My absolute 
recommendation is mmhmma€l. Good lighting is keya€!. Dona€™t share your
screen: when making a presentation, screen sharing is almost always the worst option, except in 
some specific cases (use of spreadsheets, etc.) Instead, share your presentations
using the virtual camera, or use the virtual backgrounds to locate your presentation. This will 
give you more presentation options, you will be seen at all times at a reasonable size,
and you will communicate better, more stronglya€!. Ration your calls : Video conferencing is 
tiringa€!. Youa€! need to feel comfortable in an environment that is already the
norma€!. It costs very little to project a professional image, and that the effect is very 
noticeablea€!

Daniel Seligson: Family Ties: a€~ [Joseph] Henricha€™ s study of kinship is interesting for its

John Maynard Keynes: The Choice of Units: a€~Our quantitative analysis must be expressed without 
using any quantitatively vague expressions. And, indeed, as soon as one
makes the attempt, it becomes clear, as I hope to show, that one can get on much better without 
thema€!. Thata€! incommensurable collections of miscellaneous objects cannot in
themselves provide the material for a quantitative analysis need nota€! prevent us from making 
approximate statistical comparisons, depending on some broad element of
judgmenta€!  which may possess significance and validity within certain limits. But the proper 
place for such things as net real output and the general level of prices lies within the
field                                                                                 of historical 
and statistical description, and their purpose should be to satisfy historical or social 
curiositya€!. To say that net output to-day is greater, but the price-level lower,
than ten years ago or one year ago, is a proposition of a similar character to the statement that 
Queen Victoria was a better queen but not a happier woman than Queen Elizabetha€”
a proposition not without meaning and not without interest, but unsuitable as material for the 
differential calculus. Our precision will be a mock precision if we try to use such partly
vague and non-quantitative concepts as the basis of a quantitative analysisa€! LINK:

Katie Mack: Tearing Apart the Universe: a€~Dark energy is pushing galaxies away from one another. 
Could this accelerating force lead to the universe-ending Big Rip? For a
cosmic phenomenon that is arguably the most important thing in the universe, dark energy is 
surprisingly difficult to study. As far as we can tell, it exists everywhere in the
universe, completely uniformly, woven into the fabric of space itself, and its only effect is to 
stretch space out so gradually that it has no detectable impact on any scale smaller than
the vast expanses between distant galaxiesa€! LINK:
