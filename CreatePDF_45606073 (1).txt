Fed Chair Powell wanted to see a bigger recovery in labor force participation before accelerating 
tightening, but in the past six weeks or so his patience ran out:




apnews.comWhy the Fed feels now is time to tighten credit more quickly I AP NewsWASHINGTON (AP) a€” 
For months, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell responded to surging inflation by counseling 
patience and stressing that the Fed wanted to see unemployment return to near-pre-pandemic levels 
before it would raise interest rates.

Paragraphs:

Melissa Dell: About This Knowledge Base'. a€~Information and references compiled for the PhD 
course: Unleashing Novel Data at Scale (spring 2021). Developing this new course became a major 
pandemic project, born from the observation that many important social science questions remain 
unanswered, in substantial part because the data required to examine them has traditionally been 
inaccessible. Sometimes data may be inaccessible because it is trapped in hard copy document scans 
or other types of image data; other times, information can be scattered throughout vast reams of 
text. Recent advances in deep learning offer enormous potential to convert such raw information 
into computable data at scalea€!

Melissa Dell: Economics 1342: The History of Economic Growth'. a€™This course examines the history 
of economic growth, beginning with the divergence between human ancestors and other primates and 
continuing through the end of the 20th century. Topics covered include the Neolithic Revolution; 
economic growth in ancient societies; the origins of modern economic growth; theories and evidence 
about the institutional, geographic, and cultural determinants of growth; the East Asian Miracle; 
the middle income trap; the political economy of growth; growth and inequality; and theories and 
evidence about the persistence of poverty in the worlda€™ s poorest regionsa€!

Robert Wright: Tribalism Among Nations'. a€~Even as people like [Robert] Jervis have shed more and 
more light on how cognitive distortions lead to war, we continue to indulge the distortionsa€l. As 
Jervis characterized the security dilemma€! a€oeWhen states seek the ability to defend themselves, 
they get too much and too littlea€”too much because they gain the ability to carry out aggression; 
too little because others, being menaced, will increase their own arms and so reduce the first 
statea€™ s security.a€Da€l The spiral of escalationa€! can unfold even if all actors are seeing the 
world clearlya€!. But it turns out the worlda€™ s political actors tend not to see the world 
clearlya€”and some common misperceptions can intensify this spiral. In particular: nations often 
see the defensively motivated actions of other nations as offensive in intenta€!

Tribalism Among Nations

Last week Robert Jervis, a political scientist at Columbia University, died. As deaths go, his 
wasna€™ t tragic. He had lived a full life, and he left a robust and influential body of work; by 
one count his name was the fourth most common on syllabi for college political science coursesa€!

Eric Topol: Why Paxlovid is a Just-in-Time Breakthrough'. a€~Good newsa€”this is ita€!. Paxlovid, a 
small molecule that is orally active, was specifically designed to tackle SARS-CoVa€“2a€l. It binds 
to the virusa€™ s main protease (Mpro)a€!. Inhibiting Mpro is a choke point for the virus, making 
it unable to replicatea€!. Ita€™ s going to be a blister pack for 5-days. Twice a day: Two 150 mg 
tablets of Paxlovid, and One 100 mg of Ritonavir. Thata€™ s right. Paxlovid isna€™ t given alone. 
It is accompanied by low dose Ritonavir, another viral protease inhibitor used for HIV, but being 
used here to increase the blood levels of Paxlovid without any antiviral effect itself. This works 
through a cytochrome (3A4) that is in common with the metabolism of many frequently used drugs such 
as statins and certain blood thinners, so a temporary 5-day off such drugs, or adjustment of their 
doses may be appropriate or
necessarya€!. Paxlovid is a breakthrough, and I dona€™t use that term lightly. It not only provides 
a new layer of defense, but a unique one that is not dependent on our immune system and not 
affected by Omicron or other variantsa€!. We need it out there in large quantities ASAPa€!

df> are both very interesting books, well worth reading (if vastly more optimistic about the human 
future than I feel myself to be, these days at least).
So why is Max so undercited, at least in the circles that Ia€”and Brinka€’’frequent?
