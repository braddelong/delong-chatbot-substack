I disagree with the main thesis underpinning thisa€”that Britain was, relatively, much worse 
prepared for war with Germany in 1938 than in 1939. After all, the German generals thoughta€”to all 
appearances correctly a€’’that they were also relatively unprepared for war in 1938, and in much 
better shape in 1939-1940. Nevertheless, a very good presentation of the fingertip-feel of history 
in the making.

First: The Remarkable Preservation of Classical Texts

This is verv onnd and snme.thincr that T had never thmiaht nf before/


Bret Devereaux: Rome: Decline and Fall? Part I: Words'. a€~What isa€! remarkablea€! is not that the 
people of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages lost some booksa€! but that they saved somea€!. 
Never before had a literary tradition been saved in this waya€!. Unsurprisingly, Christian monksa€! 
tended to copy a lot more religious textsa€! worksa€! seen as important for teaching good Latin 
(Cicero, Vergil, etc.) tended to get
copied morea€!. Far from destroying the literature of classical antiquity, it was the medieval 
Church itself that was the single institution most engaged in the preservation of ita€!. Writersa€! 
did not stop writing (or stop reading)a€L [That] the literature of this period was religiousa€! is 
no reason to dismiss ita€!. St. Augustine of Hippoa€! The City of Goda€\. Isidore of Seville 
(560a€“636) was famous for his Etymologies, an
encyclopedia  of sorts which would form the foundation for much of medieval learning and which in 
its summaries preserves for us quite a lot of classical bits and bobs which would have otherwise 
been lost; he also invented the period, comma and colon. Pope Gregory I (540a€“604) was also a 
prolific writer, writing hundreds of letters, a collection of four books of dialogues, a life of 
St. Benedict, a book on the role of bishops, a
commentary                                                                                          
                                                                                                    
               on the Book of Job and so on. The Rule of St. Benedict^} in 516 established the 
foundation for western monasticisma€!

That the remarkable thing about the literate monk culture of the MediAlval Age was not that they 
sacrificed so many ancient manuscripts as they recycled the parchment, but that they saved so 
manya€”that is a superb point. Previously, when ruling powers and elites shifted, the successors 
had very little regard for what their predecessors had written and thought. So what we have are 
buried papyrii in arid landscapes, inscriptions that have survived, and clay
baked, filed, and buried. A tradition of manuscripts from predecessor civilizations copied, kept in 
libraries, and then used for intellectual and cultural worka€”that was the creation of the Islamic 
and the Christian scholars, who found worth in Classical Roman and Greek authors. That we have 650 
of Sapphoa€™ s 10,000 lines is indeed a miracle.

Can you focus long enough to read this?

By Johann Hari When he was nine years old, my godson developed a brief but freakishly intense 
obsession with Elvis Presley. He took to singing a€oeJailhouse Rocka€D at the top of his voice, 
with all the low crooning and pelvis-jiggling of the King himself. He didna€™ t know this style had 
become a joke, so he offered it with all the heart-catching sincerity of a pre-teen who believes he 
is being cool. In the brief pauses before he started singing it all over
again, he demanded to know everything (a€ceEverything! Everything !a€D) about Elvis, and so I 
jabbered out the rough outline of that inspiring, sad, stupid storya€!

Brad DeLong: a€™ An interesting question I do not have an answer to: The Thirty Glorious Years 
1945a€“1975 in the Global North that were the Age of Social Democracy were the best years that 
North Atlantic economy and society had ever seen. They hit a speedbump from 1973a€“1979, yes. But 
that speedbump was of very small magnitude compared to all of those we have experienced since. Yet 
somehow that speedbump was enough to cause Social
Democracy to fail its political-stability test, and lead to its replacement by Neoliberalism. 
Neoliberalism has, in the Global North, durably delivered on none of its promises save to greatly 
enrich the rich. And it has hit many speedbumps, and more than speedbumps. Yet it, with its many 
failures, has proved remarkably durable in a way that its predecessor, Social Democracy, did not. I 
find this very mysterious. You can say that the game is finally played out, and
that right-neoliberalism in its advanced decomposition is searching for an alliance with neofascism 
because the game is played out. And it is true history rhymes: those attached to the 
pseudo-classical semi-liberal system of the Belle A%opoque similarly reached for an alliance with 
real fascism in the chaos of 1914a€“1933. But I do not find this an adequate explanation of what 
has been going on since 1975a€!

Lyman Stone: a€™ The interesting thing I am flagging is not a€oeHow did the Macedonians rule as a 
minority?a€D but a€oeHow did the people of Greece fill 50a€“100 new cities with people plus a thin 
layer of elites spread across an entire empire plus large massed infantry formations of c o-ethnic 
s?a€Da€ I Youa€™ d need almost half the. population of the original Greek territories to emigrate 
just to get a small percentage of the population made up of
Greeks. Even if you assume that every Greek immigrant creates 2 Hellenized locals, this is 
implausiblea€!

Brad DeLong: Or you would need a bunch of people to become Greek. From 350 to 550 is eight 
generations. What proportion of those calling themselves a€ceVisigothsa€O in Spain in 1550 had all 
256 of their circaa€“350 ancestors among the Visigoths in Moldavia back then? What proportion had 
any? My go-to analogy for this has been the British Raja€”if you could have, in India, become 
a€ceEnglisha€D simply by moving into the cantonment and
making an effort to speak the language. Plus remember the Greeks had lots of practice in making 
thugatropoleis. But I agree it was a lift that required enormous amounts of heavy lifting by not 
just Alexander, but by the subsequent generations of Ptolemaids and Seleukidsa€!

Brad DeLong: The real Sister Souljah moment'.

Bill Clinton: "We all make mistakes, and sometimes wea€™re not as sensitive as we ought to be, and 
we have an obligationa€”all of usa€”to call attention to prejudice wherever we see it. A few months 
ago I made a mistake. I joined a friend of mine and I played golf at a country club. It didna€™t 
have any African-American members. I was criticized for doing it. You know what? I was rightly 
criticized for doing it. I made a mistake.
And I said I wouldna€™ t ever do that again.

I think all of us have got to be sensitive to that. We cana€™t get anywhere in this country 
pointing the finger across racial lines. If we do that, wea€™re dead and they will beat us. Even in 
Reverend Jacksona€™ s new math of this election, ita€™ s hard to get to a 34% solution or a 40% 
solution if the American people can be divided by race."

Yes, Clinton did pounce on Jesse Jackson for inviting Sister Souljah to speaka€!. a€oeln United 
States politics, a Sister Souljah moment is a politiciana€™ s public repudiation of an extremist 
person or group, statement, or position.a€da€! That is what the memory of it has become. That is 
what people are calling on Biden to do when they call on him to find a a€oeSister Souljaha€D 
moment. But Clinton was trying to do something more complex. While a
Reagan or a Romney are in the business of trying to win white votes by finding opportunities to 
ostentatiously reject the very idea they might appeal to Blacks, Clinton wants and desperately 
needs and knows he wants and desperately needs Rainbow Coalition votes in the falla€!

David Rothkopf: a€™ Vladimir Putin might have thought that his efforts to foster division in the 
US, even winning the support of the Trumpist right, would sideline the US while he attacked his 
neighbors. He might have thought that pulling out of Afghanistan was a sign of American retreat 
rather than ending a debacle and focusing our energies and resources where real threats and 
opportunities lay. He might have thought Biden would offer the kind of
minimal resistance Putin found from Bush and Obama when he last invaded his neighbors. Or he might 
have been deluded by Trumpa€™ s infatuation with him. Putin might have thought that NATO was a dead 
letter, without a real mission for the past three decades and that its divisions would undermine 
its ability to mobilize when Russia presented a real threat to European security. He might have 
thought any of these things or all of them. Whatever his
reasoning, he has guessed wrong. Biden will turn out to be the toughest US president he has faced. 
And NATO, divisions and all, is showing it is ready to defend its interestsa€!

His threea€”abundance, egalitarianism, and agencya€’’might be better broken down into six:

1. Material abundance

2. The sharing of that material abundancea€’’everybody has the social power to command resources, 
and nobody has the power to simply by their own say-so command vastly more resources than others.

3. Status differences are moderatea€”and are based on expertise-based prestige, in terms of 
demonstrated accomplishments and skill that others can learn from observing (or at least admire).

4. Everyone gets listened to by humanity at large. Nobody is silenced, and nobody is of no concern 
to others.

5. You can, individually, shape your life in the direction that you really want to shape it.

6. We can, collectively, shape our lives together in the directions that we really want to do so.

I move to six because the three that Noah has placed under a€oeegalitarianisma€n are really three 
different things: control over material resources is a very different thing from commanding 
respect, which is a very different thing than having a voice. The terms-of-trade on which any one 
of these can be turned into the others are very unfavorable.
What are our chances of getting there in the medium term?

Well, there is no reason why we must engage in a massive global thermonuclear war. There is no 
reason why we cannot control and then adapt to global warming at a moderate cost (of, say, less 
than 20%a€”a decadea€™ s potential economic growth), or for the problems of allocating the costs of 
global warming to crash our civilization, perhaps by triggering a global thermonuclear war. There 
is no reason why our social media companies, all out of a desire to
glue us to screens so they can sell us ads for NFTs, must turn us into zombified hordes of 
easily-grifted morons undergoing fearful moral panic after moral panic and losing sight of the 
good, the beautiful, and the true.

But any one of these threea€”or all three of thema€”could happen, and they are not consistent with 
an optimistic future.
Suppose we manage to avoid these three?

Can we then say that the future is bright?
