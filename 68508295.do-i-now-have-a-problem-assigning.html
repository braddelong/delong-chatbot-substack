concept of Malthusian economies. </p><p>I would also say that they are all far from perfect: </p><ul><li><p>In the first, fertility does not exceed morality, but they, rather, balance. </p></li><li><p>In the second, I would not say that a Malthusian economy relies on exploitation, but rather that it provides very powerful pressures that produce exploitation. </p></li><li><p>In the third, the sentence “The positive check is the death rate and the preventative check is the birth rate” is just wrong. </p></li></ul><p>Thus all three are well below A-level understanding. But they appear to be at B-level understanding. And this is a problem.</p><p>This is a problem, of course, because there is no <em><strong>mind</strong></em> back there. There is no <em><strong>understanding</strong></em>. There is just a bag of words and a set of numbers that are correlations.</p><p>And this fact, of course, provokes three reactions from me:</p><ul><li><p>Perhaps this demonstrates how powerful is our tropism to attribute human mind-level competence to systems for which that attribution is a major category error. There is no more a human-level mind behind each of these answers than it is the case that the lightning is a very large red-haired guy with a big hammer and major anger management problems who drives a cart with two goats. You can make the sociobiology move that such attribution was useful in the environment of evolutionary adaptation, for the potential loss from assuming that something is much dumber than you can be very large. But whether you want to claim this tropism is “adaptive” or not, I do believe that it is a fact.</p></li><li><p>Perhaps this demonstrates how much “reading” is “taking black marks on a page, and from them spinning-up a sub-Turing instantiation of a human mind, which we then run in a separate sandbox on our Wittwer and interrogate”. Perhaps this demonstrates how enormously wide the gap can be between the mind of the author that wrote the words and the mind that we construct from the words. Perhaps this demonstrates how much reading takes place between the ears. (And, of course, perhaps this demonstrates how much success in schoolwork evaluations comes not from learning the material, but rather from learning how to spread out the chicken-feed in front of the instructor, that they will then glom onto, and leave them to conclude that you know much much more than you in fact do.)</p></li><li><p>Perhaps this should lead us to wonder how much of our own thought is really thought, really understand it, and how much is just that somewhere inside our brains is a bag of words, and a set of numbers that are correlations.</p></li></ul><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/do-i-now-have-a-problem-assigning?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/do-i-now-have-a-problem-assigning?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/do-i-now-have-a-problem-assigning/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/do-i-now-have-a-problem-assigning/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get a group subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true"><span>Get a group subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donate Subscriptions&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true"><span>Donate Subscriptions</span></a></p><div class="install-substack-app-embed"><img class="install-substack-app-embed-img" src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png"><div class="install-substack-app-embed-text"><div class="install-substack-app-header">Read Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality in the Substack app</div><div class="install-substack-app-text">Available for iOS and Android</div></div><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_context=author-post-insert" target="_blank" class="install-substack-app-embed-link"><button class="install-substack-app-embed-btn button primary">Get the app</button></a></div><h6>I greatly enjoy and am, in fact, driven to write Grasping Reality—but its long-term viability and quality do depend on voluntary subscriptions from paying supporters.
