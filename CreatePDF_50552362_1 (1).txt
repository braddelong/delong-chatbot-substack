Paragraphs:

J.R.R. Tolkien: Telling Off Nazis: a€~Thank you for your letter. I regret that I am not clear as to 
what you intend by arisch. I am not of Aryan extraction: that is Indo-Iranian; as far as I am aware 
none of my ancestors spoke Hindustani, Persian, Gypsy, or any related dialects. But if I am to 
understand that you are enquiring whether I am of Jewish origin, I can only reply that I regret 
that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-
grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany: the main part of my descent is 
therefore purely English, and I am an English subjecta€’’which should be sufficient. I have been 
accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the 
period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, 
forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this
sort   are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a 
German name will no longer be a source of pride. Your enquiry is doubtless made in order to comply 
with the laws of your own country, but that this should be held to apply to the subjects of another 
state would be improper, even if it had (as it has not) any bearing whatsoever on the merits of my 
work or its sustainability for publication, of which you appear to have satisfied
yourselves without reference to my Abstammung3^\

Joseph E. Gagnon & Christopher G. Collins: Low Inflation Bends the Phillips Curve: a€~The Phillips 
curve, which traces out a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment, has undergone 
tremendous changes over more than 100 years. Some researchers argue that the slope of the curve in 
the United States fell substantially around 20 years ago so that unemployment now has little or no 
effect on inflation. This paper shows that another
hypothesis is equally consistent with the data: The Phillips curve may be nonlinear when inflation 
is low, with the economy having operated in the flat region of the curve for most of the past 20 
years. The next few years may be decisive in the debate between these hypotheses, as unemployment 
has returned to a range in which a nonlinear curve ought to display significant steepness. A flat 
Phillips curve implies little change in inflation going forward, but a
nonlinear curve implies moderate increases in inflation over the next few yearsa€!

David Reifschneider & David Wilcox: _The Case for a Cautiously Optimistic Outlook for US 
Inflation_: a€~There is a risk that the expectations-augmented Phillips curve model is 
fundamentally wrong and that the stability of long-run inflation expectations does not actually 
mattera€!. Wea€! are skepticala€!. Core inflation hardly respondeda€”and then only brieflya€”to the 
rise in oil prices from $30/ barrel in early 2004 to almost $140/barrel by the summer
of 2008, to the Great Recession, to the tight labor market of 2018 and 2019, or to the shutdown of 
much of the economy in the spring of 2020a€!. If we are experiencing a return to prea€‘T990 
inflation dynamics, long-run inflation expectations should have jumped even if they do not play an 
important role in propagating inflationa€!. The FOMC should look through todaya€™ s elevated 
inflation readings and any future bumps that may occur and focus instead
on attempting to discern where inflation is likely to settle outa€!. It should avoid unnecessarily 
restraining real activity in the near term to combat an inflation problem that can be reasonably 
expected to, for the most part, self-correcta€!. The Fed musta€! demonstrate that it continues to 
understand that it has inescapable and unconditional responsibility for controlling inflation over 
the longer runa€! demonstrate its willingness to shoulder this responsibility^!.
We think that the Fed may not need to take the federal funds rate materially above its neutral 
level in the current cycle of tighteninga€!

Jude Doyle: If You Say a€a?Cancel Cultured€dOne More Time, So Help Me: a€~[Sarah] Hepolaa€™ s 
article is bada€! The reader braces for the expected a€oegender criticala€n turn, or perhaps a 
brisk bit of racism, only to finda€! Hepola is actually accusing Brock Turnera€™ s victim, Chanel 
Miller, of being a blackout drunk who invited her own rape. a€oel have no reason to suspect that 
Chanel Miller is a chronic blackout drinker, but my research taught
me that blackout drinking can be chronic in college environments,a€D Hepola assures us, and that, 
plus the fact that Hepola used to have a drinking problem, has given her the wisdom to know that 
some girls are asking for it: a€oel watched from afar as the person whose memory had not recorded 
the incident came to control the narrativea€!. I sympathized with many of these men: Johnny Depp, 
Ryan Adams, Brett Kavanaugh, every booze-soaked dumbass
who has been accused of doing or saying things he may or may not remember, may or may not regret, 
may or may not have done while under the influence. But being sympathetic to these fallen 
creaturesa€”a trait instilled by literature, my mother, and Opraha€”had been declared a sin. I 
toyed with the idea of writing about Brock Turner. Maybe it would get me into The New Yorker\a€Oa€\

For what ita€™ s worth, Brock Turner was not convicted on Millera€™ s word. He was interrupted in 
the act of raping her by two witnesses, who pried him off Millera€™ s unconscious and badly injured 
body.
This is a fact Hepola does not mention and, quite possibly, does not know.

Yet Brock Turner, like all Goda€™ s creatures, is two steps away from having his face melted off in 
a nuclear conflagration^!. You sound like an out-of-touch jackass writing about a€oecancel 
culturea€D at the best of times, but you sound downright delusional writing about it in March of 
2022. There are real problems in the worlda€!. Hepola mentions none of these things. They might as 
well not exist for her. Therea€™ s a war and a pandemic and a fascist
uprising and shea€™ s complaining about hanging out in a fucking brownstone with New York Times 
columnists who are worried they wona€™t get enough likes on Tweets about Jonathan Franzen novels.

Subject: The Post-WWI Political Emergence of Ukraine

lllustrissimus Adam Tooze has a ver nice extended quote from his own book, The Deluge 
<https://www.google.com/books/edition/The Deluge/HC7aCwAAQBAJ>, on Ukraine between Imperial Germany 
and Bolshevik Russia in 1918:

Adam Tooze: Brest-Litovska€” Imperial Germany & the Troubled Birth of Modern Ukraine'. a€~In 1918 
Austria and Germany confidently expected at least 1 million tons from their new Ukrainian ally. But 
by the end of April it had become clear that a€~exploitinga€™ the bread basket of the Ukraine would 
present more problems than these fantasies allowed. If they were to avoid the enormous costs of a 
full-scale occupation, Austria
and Germany needed a cooperative local authority to collaborate with them. Having been driven out 
of Kiev (by a Bolshevik attack), only to be restored courtesy of the German Army, the Rada needed a 
breathing space to re- establish itself. But the scale and urgency of Germany and Austriaa€™ s 
economic demands made this impossible.

In Ukraine, as in the rest of revolutionary Russia, the only way to secure popular legitimacy was 
to cede possession of the land to the peasants. Over the summer of 1917 a nationwide land grab had 
redistributed the gentrya€™ s estates. In the nationwide Constituent Assembly election, the 
peasants of Ukraine had voted in their millions for the party that promised a village- based 
agrarian future, the Social Revolutionaries. The SRs were
reliable allies against the Bolsheviks, but their land policy ran directly counter to the interests 
of the Central Powers. To maximize the surplus available for export, they needed cultivation to be 
concentrated in large, market- orientated farms. For the Rada to have presided over the restoration 
of the great estates for the sake of its German protectors would have discredited it completely. 
For the Germans themselves to reverse the agrarian
revolution by force would have required hundreds of thousands of troops from the Western Front that 
Ludendorff could ill afford.

If the Germans had been able to barter desirable manufactured goods in exchange for grain 
deliveries, this conflict might have been alleviated. Under the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, Germany had 
committed itself to trading grain for industrial goods. But under the strain of the war effort, 
goods for export were in desperately short supply. To purchase the grain they needed, the Central 
Powers resorted to the short- term expedient of simply
ordering the Ukrainian National Bank to print whatever currency they required. This gave them 
purchasing power and avoided requisitioning, but within a matter of months it rendered the currency 
worthless. As General Hoffmann noted from Kiev: a€~Everyone is rolling in money. Roubles are 
printed and almost given awaya€! the peasants have enough stocks of corn to live on for two or 
three years, but they will not sell it.a€™

Having reached this point, there was no alternative but to resort to coercion. In early April, 
Field Marshal Hermann von Eichhorn, the German occupation commander, issued a decree requiring 
compulsory cultivation of all land. However, the Field Marshal acted without the approval of the 
Rada, and the deputies refused to ratify the decree. Within days, the German military decided 
against diplomacy. In a coup da€™ A©tat, they ousted

the Ukrainian National Assembly and installed a so-called Hetmanate under the Tsarist cavalry 
officer Pyotr Skoropadskyi. Only six weeks after the ratification of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty by 
Germanya€™ s own Reichstag, under the pressure of economic necessity, the German military had 
unilaterally abandoned any residual claim to be acting as the protector           of the legitimate 
causeof self- determination. Skoropadskyi spoke virtually
no Ukrainian and filled his cabinet with conservative Russian nationalists. The real power-holders 
in Germany seemed to have lost interest in the project of creating a viable Ukrainian nation state. 
Instead, they appeared to be readying Kiev as the launching pad for a conservative reconquest of 
all of Russia.

The result, as Erzberger lamented in the Reichstag was not just discreditable, but dysfunctional. 
a€~A German soldier can no longer show himself unarmed in Kieva€! the railway men and workmen are 
planning a general strikea€! the peasants would not deliver any grain, and bloodshed must be 
reckoned with in the event of requisitioning^™. Instead of the            1    million tons 
promised under the peacetreaty, the Ukrainedelivered nomore
than 173,000 tons to the Central Powers in 1918. 54 But it was not bread alone that was at stake. 
The question that concerned Erzberger and his colleagues in the Reichstag majority was who 
controlled the Reich. In future Erzberger demanded all measures in the Baltics and Ukraine should 
have the approval of the Reichstag.

By June, Ludendorffa€™ s staff had lost any interest in long-term sponsorship of an independent 
Ukrainian state. Instead, they hoped to march to Petrograd and install a pro-German conservative 
government for all of Russia that would trade the return of Ukrainian to Russian sovereignty in 
exchange for German economic domination of all of Russia.

As Germanya€™ s position on the Western front collapsed, the Reichstag found itself struggling to 
prevent the generals from launching a final German offensive in the East towards Petrograd. As they 
were agonizingly aware they were, de facto, helping to assure the survival of the increasingly 
terroristic Bolsheviks regime, which they abhorred on political grounds.
And, as Germanya€™ s power collapsed, so too did the regime it had created in Kiev. Skoropadskya€™ 
s regime did not last beyond December 1918 when Ukraine became a Peoplea€™ s Republica€!

As I understand it, immediately after the fall of the Czar Nicholas II Romanov, Mykhailo Hrushevsky 
led the formation of the Central Rada in Kyiv which sought approval from Petrograd to establish a 
regional government. By late June 1917 the Central Rada had declared Ukrainian autonomy within a 
Russian federation. In the aftermath of the Bolshevik coup in Petrograd, the Central Rada declared 
independence: a Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR). The
Bolsheviks faction in Kyiv then found itself massively outnumbered, and fled to Kharkiv, where 
Christian Rakovksy declared himself the head of the real, Bolshevik, government of Ukraine. Then

came Trotsky's March 1918 signature to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, by which the Bolsheviks 
recognized the independence of Ukraine, and its location within the Imperial German sphere of 
influence. By the late Spring of 1918, it appeared that this independent
Ukraine included all lands up to and including the Lower Volga and the Kuban, with a boundary 
perhaps at the Caucasus.

Then the Germans staged their coup d'etat, establishing what they hoped would be their puppet 
Hetmanate. It did not survive the end of the German Empire in November 1918. As the Bolshevik 
Ukrainian armies moved in and defeated the non-Bolshevik armies, non-Bolsheviks in Lviv declared a 
Western Ukrainian People's Republic (ZUNR). Neither the ZUNR nor the UNR could get the Allies in 
Versailles to give them the time of day. Things then got swept
up in the Bolshevik-Polish Wear and with the Peace of Riga in March 1921 the Ukraine was divided 
between (a) Poland, (b) the Ukrainian SSR, and (c) Russia, which took Crimea, Kuban, and Don 
Cossacks. Somehow, in all this, Carpathian Ruthenium found itself in Czechoslovakia, and Bukovina 
found itself in Roumania. And I have not mentioned Nestor Makhno.

Now it could very easily have gone otherwise. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had the Grand Duchy of 
Warsaw and a Greater Lithuania assigned to Germany in some form., It had Finland, Estonia, 
"Livonia" (Latvia), and Ukraine "self-determined". All of the German-assigned and self-determined 
territories at Brest-Litovsk became interwar nation-states, save for Ukraine, which became the 
Ukrainian SSR, and a member of the USSR.

I have always thought that Lennon's attitude toward nationalism derived from his belief that the 
nation state was little and the party was all. Individual soviet socialist republics could be 
independent. But their parties would be directed from Moscow. And that would be what counted. I 
think we see a legacy of this in the Soviet demand that each of the USSR's union republics have a 
seat in the United Nations, which was then bargained down to the USSR having
three seats: Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. (Was Russia always the Security Council power, or was it 
the USSR? I do not know.)

I believe that in Lenina€™ s mind the template was tha,t as the revolution advanced, newly 
Bolshevized areas would join the USSR as member republics, independent but with their parties 
democratically centralized under Moscow. Today the Ukraine. At some future date Finland, Estonia, 
Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Later on Bavaria, Hungary, Austria, and Prussia, and so forth.
But after World War II that pattern was not followed. To my knowledge, none of the Soviet 
satellites petitioned to join the US SRa€’’although in 1960 the government of Czechoslovakia did 
change its name from "People's Republic of Czechoslovakia" to the "Czechoslovak Soviet Socialist 
Republic", ACESSR...


Now it could very easily have gone otherwise. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had the Grand Duchy of 
Warsaw and a Greater Lithuania assigned to Germany in some form., It had Finland, Estonia, 
"Livonia" (Latvia), and Ukraine "self-determined". All of the German-assigned and self-determined 
territories at Brest-Litovsk became interwar nation-states, save for Ukraine, which became the
