Paragraphs:

At some level, it is really sad that Thomas Sowell back then and that Thomas Sowell today thinks 
there is something wrong with "monopolistic competition". It makes predictionsa€”that the 
competitive market place will provide "to
many" varieties, the firms have power to choose at what price they will sell, and that the market 
as a whole will be in efficient with each variety produced at too small a scale in order to 
generate quasi-rents but with all the quasi-rents
dissipated as a result of entry. Those predictions seem to be, well, true. And Stigler's 
"demolition" seems to have consisted of saying sometimes saying that monopolistic competition 
should be rejected on methodological-pragmatic
grounds because it did not make predictions significantly different from the competitive model 
(which was false), and sometimes saying that the model failed internal tests of logical consistency 
(which all models must: they are maps, not
territories, and have seams where the different pieces of the map adjoin):

Thomas Sowell: A Studenta€™ s Eye View of George Stigler: a€~In the winter quarter, I enrolled for 
my first course under Stigler. It was a€oeindustrial organization^ na€!. Few, if any, areas of 
economics have
as much confusion, circular reasoning, definitional traps, and fervent nonsense as industrial 
organization. It was the perfect place for Stigler to conduct a Demolition Derby. Nor was he 
hesitant about the task.

Theories like a€oemonopolistic competition^ □ and a€oecountervailing power,a€D which were treated 
reverently at Harvard (where they originated), were eviscerated by Stiglera€!. When shattering 
theories
with gusto, Stigler seemed utterly uninhibited by the question, a€oeBut what would you put in its 
place?a€D Nor should he have been. When the emperor has no clothes, you dona€™ t wait until you can 
design a
whole wardrobe before saying so. In academia, saying that the emperor has no clothes can be a 
full-time occupation. The regularity with which high-sounding nonsense erupts among intellectuals 
is like that of
Old Faithful, with perhaps not as long an interval in between intellectual geysers .a€!

Ah. But Noah, the claim is that people hate inflation, not that people hate supply-shock caused 
inflation. That is the kind that reduces worker well-being:

Noah Smith: Why Do People Hate Inflation?: a€~I dona€™ t think we should be panicking about 
inflation yet. Buta€! why do we even carea€! in the first place ?a€! Inflation really made people 
very very upset
from maybe around 1974 to around 1983. That roughly coincides with when inflation was actually high 
in Americaa€!. When you look at a graph of nominal wages, it sure looks like inflation doesna€™t 
affect it
very mucha€!. Now look at a graph of real wages! Ita€™ s all over the place !a€! It sure looks like 
nominal wages are sticky, meaning that inflationa€”if it happens for the wrong reasonsa€”can reduce
workersa€™ wages and real purchasing powera€!.. Why is it so hard for workers to negotiate 
cost-of-living raises? Why was this so hard even in the late 60s and 70s, when unions were much 
stronger than they
are   today? What is broken in our wage-setting process? If we can answer that question, we might 
have a chance of fixing ita€!

Only if you make people think that liberals are the enemy can you engage your basea€™ s passions 
while getting them to ignore their interests, and so make them feel pleased that you are picking 
their pockets:

Alan Wolfe (2004): A Fascist Philosopher Helps Us Understand Contemporary Politics: a€~Liberals 
think of politics as a means; conservatives as an end. Politics, for liberals, stops at the 
watera€™ s edge; for
conservatives, politics never stops. Liberals think of conservatives as potential future allies; 
conservatives treat liberals as unworthy of recognition. Liberals believe policies ought to be 
judged against an
independent ideal such as human welfare or the greatest good for the greatest number; conservatives 
evaluate policies by whether they advance their conservative causes. Liberals instinctively want to 
dampen
passions; conservatives are bent on inflaming them. Liberals think there is a third way between 
liberalism and conservatism; conservatives believe that anyone who is not a conservative is a 
liberal. Liberals want
to put boundaries on the political by claiming that individuals have certain rights that no 
government can take away; conservatives argue that in cases of emergency a€! the reach and capacity 
of the state cannot
be challengeda€!

Markus sets out his framework for thinking about safe assets, and why the fiscal theory of the 
price level is badly broken right now:

Markus Brunnermeier: Inflation, Safe Assets & Debt Sustainability: a€~The Fiscal Theory of [the] 
Price Level[a€™ s]a€! key equation is the nominal value of government bonds divided by the price 
level
equals the discounted present value of the primary surplusesa€!. [But] a bubble term needs to be 
addeda€! Japanese experience provides a nice case studya€!. Countries can have a primary deficit 
all the timea€!
if  the interest rate on the government bond is smaller than the growth rate of the economya€!. 
Interest is low if the government debt is a safe asset, i.e. it allows precautionary self-insurance 
via retrading and gains
in value in times of recessionsa€!. The risk-free rate for a log-utility setting is the sum of the 
time preference rate (valuing future utility), the expected growth of consumption (higher rates for 
future wealth), and
negative precautionary savings components consisting of the variance of aggregate and idiosyncratic 
consumption growth risk. A risk premium is added to the risk-free ratea€! inflation risk and the 
loss of safe
asset status risk. Finally, the convenience yield is subtracteda€! becausea€! government bondsa€!

The normalization of fascism is a grave danger, I agree:

Frank Wilhoit: The David Irving Case: a€~The Irving case is a pinhole view into the curation (or 
lack of curation) of the public discourse. This is perhaps the most pressing topic of the moment. 
From that
standpoint, pinhole views wona€™t do. In order to teach the Irving moment, we must at once pivot 
from [the deservedness of] his comeuppance to [the drivers of] the subsequent, nearly complete 
failure of
curation.   It is utterly unthinkable that any of todaya€™ s (many) Irvings might be driven out of 
the arena or even face any serious adverse consequences for their actions. How did we get here and 
what is the way
forward?a€!

That ever since Carter evangelicals have voted by large margins for the non-religious but racist 
candidate over the religious but non-racist candidate tells us that it was never about religion, 
no?:

Kenneth L. Woodward: Evangelicals, Trump, and How Politics Shapes Religiona€”Not the Other Way 
Around: a€~These political scientists seea€! the Republicans perceived as the party hospitable to 
religious
Americans and the Democrats seen as the home of the non-religious. This may seem implausible with a
