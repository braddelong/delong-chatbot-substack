Key Insights:

•  There is a four-day creative-destruction festschrift for Philippe Aghion & Peter Howitt starting 
June 9: The Economics of Creative Destruction <https://zoom.usZj/98595732585>

•  When industrial policy in America has been successful, it has always had a profound political 
driving motive: maintaining independence, manifest destiny, Sputnik, and so on. The only such 
driver todaya€”and it is urgenta€”is green energy to fight global warminga€!

•  The U.S. used to be excellent not just on the a€renoveltya€D prong of Breznitza€™ s 
prosperity-in-an-unforgiving-world quadent, but also on the a€ reengineering designa€D, 
a€oesecond-generation innovationa€D, and a€oeproduction-assemblya€n prongs as well. We threw that 
away in the era Reagan begana€”the era of neoliberalism, financialization-driven short-termism, and 
tax cut-driven exchange overvaluation. We need to get those other
three prongs back, lest we become a country of technoprinces and dopamine-loop brain-hacked 
technoserfsa€!

• When you do industrial policy, you need to think very carefully about what kind of economy you 
want to createa€!

•  A better retranslation of the Arkhilokhos-Isaiah Berlin a€«Fox & Hedgehoga€D tag line is: 
a€oeThe fox knows many tricks; the hedgehog knows one good onea€!a€D

• Hexapodia!
