<https://www.basicbooks .com/titles/william-macaskill/what-we-owe-the-future/9781541618633/>:

Will MacAskill. He is inevitable. Every podcast episode, every word spoken. He's in your house.,,
Vlad @vladtheengineer: a€~I was assembling a new bed frame, Will MacAskill was in the box. I get 
home from work, a€oedid you hear the new Will MacAskill on Sam Harris?a€n I brush my teeth, what 
comes out of the toothpaste tube? MacAskill. I am forced to brush my teeth using Will MacAskilla€!
Conor James @utopiannotions: a€~I go to bed. Will MacAskill is my pillow. I turn off the light and

So the question is: how close can I come to duplicating this launch?

It helps a lot that it is quite a good book. But it is not a perfect book. So would I be mean, 
jealous, and envious to think that it is punching above its weight?

The book is a combination of history, politics, a primer on Derrick Parfit, and a great deal of 
wise things said about how to effectively do good. It consists 3/4 of very good and clever 
observations.

It has some claims I find strange: principally that the future of the world is a€oecausally thina€D 
in our generationa€”that whatever patterns we impose on human society cannot or will not be undone 
by the many trillions of us who will live in the futurea€”and that moral philosophy and moral 
philosophers are particularly key (as moral philosophy is likely to be the
most fixed). Hence not only are we special people with unique powers and influence, but among us 
moral philosophers are very special people with immense powers and influence never to be matched in 
all of future history. This seems grandiose, and if it diverts resources from the bottom billion to 
exploring outer space I wouls be worried. But worry about, and action
to benefit, the future does not crowd out, much, action to benefit the present.

Plus there are excursions into Rapture of the Nerds and Rokoa€™ s Basilisk thought: arguments that 
I have never been able to understand as anything.

As I said, I do think Matt Yglesias has it right here: there is certainly a book to be written 
about Al-threat. There is certainly a book to be written about Longtermism. They are not the same 
booka€”save for the fact that Longtermists, like all other people, think that the extinction of the 
human species within our own expected natural lifetimes is something we should
take substantial care to avoid. Yet the Longtermist book, and the Al-threat book, and several other 
books are mashed together in a short book. And that means thateach piece of it leaves me 
unsatisfied, andwanting more.

Because it seems to me that it is more sketches of five books bound together than a single book, it 
does seem to me that its launch is punching above its weight.
And I want my book <bit.ly/3pP3Krk> to punch above its weight too.

Here we have a justifiably arrogant author placing his chips:

Thouky dides the Athenian: The Peloponnesian War: a€~The absence of the fabulous in my history 
will, I fear, detract somewhat from its interest; but if it be judged useful by those inquirers who 
desire an exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation of the future, which in the 
course of human things must resemble if it does not
reflect it, I shall be content.

In sum, I have written my work, not as a ticket-punch or to win transitory applause in the moment, 
but as a treasure for all time.

James Sweet: Is History History?: Identity Politics and Teleologies of the Present 
<https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-historv/september-2022/is-h
istorv-historv-identity-politics-and-teleologies-of-the-present>: a€~[In a Ghana hotel,] African 
Americans began trickling into the breakfast bara€! more than
a dozen members of the same familya€”three generations deepa€!. In front of one of the elders was a 
dog-eared copy of The 1619 Project^}. My family and I toured Elmina Castle alongside several 
Ghanaians, a Dane, and a Jamaican family. Our guide gave a well-rehearsed tour geared toward 
African Americansa€!. I am troubleda€!. Less
than one percent of the Africans passing through Elmina arrived in North Americaa€!. Should the 
guidea€™ s story differ for a tour with no African Americans? Likewise, would The 1619 Project tell 
a different history if it took into consideration that the shipboard kin of Jamestowna€™ s a€oe2O. 
and odda€D Africans also went to Mexico,
Jamaica, and Bermuda?a€! Do efforts to claim a usable African American past reify elements of 
American hegemony and exceptionalism such narratives aim to dismantle?a€!

At least as I see it, James Sweet appears to have three complaints here:

1. The 1619 Project should have been a general history of Atlantic slavery and its ramifications, 
rather than focused on America and the experience of African-Americans under the harrow.

2. Ghanaian tour guides should tune their presentations to the concerns of their actual audiences, 
rather than have onea€”African-American-orienteda€’’presentation chosen because that is what the 
bulk of those who come to Elmina Castle with the bulk of the money are eager to learn about.

3. In coming to Elmina castle with money, wanting to learn about their ancestors, African-Americans 
are engaged in acts of imperialism and domination.

To which my reaction is: Is this for reals? I guess I need to pay more attention to Bari Weiss than 
I had thought. African-Americans trying to connect with the truly horrific heritage of their 
ancestors and Ghanian tour guidesa€”that is really what we call a€oepunching upa€U, James.
And I have already dealt with the a€oewe should not be a€~presentista€™ a€D claim. As I said 
yesterday:

•  If they are so alien to us that their mental universe has so little overlap with ours that we 
cannot enter it and judge, then they are useless to us, and boring: it is more fun to go watch 
Tik-Tok videos, and we should do so.

•  If they are not so alien, then claims that we should overlook or minimize nasty things they did 
have a very peculiar vision of what history ought to be behind them. Let me try to lay out what I 
think it is:

For most of recorded human history, humanity was desperately poor. The level of technology, the 
size of the population, and the available natural resources meant that it was impossible for 
everyone to have enough. Indeed, the only way that even some people could have enough was via their 
becoming part of an A©lite, and constructing, operating, and maintaining
an exploitation-and-domination machine that, by force and fraud, took a great deal of what other 
people made, and grabbed it for themselves and their allies in the A©lite.

Now, most of recorded human history as written by historians who are not archAiologists is history 
that listens to the voices of the members of this A©lite, for they were the literate ones, or ones 
whose deeds were of interest and immediate concern to the literate: the thugs-with-spears, and 
their tame bureaucrats, accountants, and propagandists, as they came into
conflict and worked in cooperation with each other to acquire, distribute, and utilize the 
extracted surplus. It is a history that is primarily of those who benefited from the operation of 
the exploitation-and-domination machine.

In this context, cries a€oethe mores of those in the past were different from ours!a€D and that we 
should not judge them are mostly demands that we not focus too much on the exploitation and 
domination machine and its operation and justification, but rather look at high cultural 
productions and political maneuverings as the proper domain of history. But I see no
justification for that other than: a€oel am in a position of authority, and that is how it is 
convenient for me for things to be.a€D
