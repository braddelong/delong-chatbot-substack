What do you think happened at the start of the second half of the 2010s to make investment in 
Britain go into reverse, and so inflict substantial material damage on the long-run growth 
prospects of the British economy? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?

Paragraphs:

Martin Sandbu: Shortages, What shortages? Global Markets Are Delivering'. a€~Take durable goods. 
Headlines about shortages are the only thing that seem in ample supply, and everyone is 
experiencing delays in obtaining items, such as cars, that could previously be had with instant 
gratification. But the actual supply of durable goods is at record
highs. Since the summer of last year, American consumers have been obtaining them in volumes much 
larger than the pre-pandemic trend. Many EU economies, including Germany, Italy and the 
Netherlands, have also matched or exceeded 2019 levels of durable goods consumption. What about 
semiconductors? In a short paper published a month ago,
Daniel Rees and Phurichai Rungcharoenkitkul of the Bank for International Settlements showed that 
semiconductor exports from Taiwan and Korea in 2020 exceeded the volumes recorded in 2019, and 2021 
exceeded 2020. Exports currently appear to be running at a good 30 per cent above two years ago. 
The BISa€™ s Hyun Song Shin has added that
semiconductor sales in the US are much higher than in the years before the pandemica€!. Even these 
remarkable increases have not always been enough to satisfy soaring demand. But far from failing 
us, the globalised capitalist production system has delivered, ramping up supplies in record time 
in response to one unexpected demand surge after
anothera€!

Paul Krugman: What Would a Hard Landing Look Like?'. a€~The Fed has been wrong about inflation so 
far. What if ita€™ s wrong again?a€! Although we talk a lot about inflation in the 1970s, the real 
pain came in the 1980s, as Paul Volckera€™ s Fed tried to bring inflation down. It succeeded, but 
at an enormous pricea€!. Ita€™ s not totally clear
whether this huge wave of unemployment was necessary. Influential research using state-level data 
argues that the main factor in the Volcker disinflation was a big change in public expectations 
that could conceivably have happened without such a severe recession. But for now the working 
hypothesis for most economists is still that it took a nasty,
sustained slump to end the inflation of the 1970s. Are we looking at something similar in our 
future? Probably not, for several reasonsa€!. Underlying inflation by the end of 2022 isna€™ t 
likely to be anywhere near 1980 levelsa€!. The current inflation looks more like 1946a€“48 than 
like the 1970sa€!. The Feda€™ s 2 percent inflation target was set
a  couple of decades ago, based to a large extent on economic analyses that have turned out to be 
wronga€!. Right now the Fed is betting thata€! dilemma[s] wona€™t arise. Leta€™ s hope ita€™ s 
righta€!

CA©lia Pedroso: Garum: An Ancient Condiment Brought Back to Life'. a€~Garum eventually lost its 
place in the kitchens of the Mediterranean and other parts of the former Roman Empire. Iterations 
of the pungent sauce exist today, like Colatura di Alici in Italy, but its original recipe and 
method of production are no more than ancient relics. A rather
smelly experiment at an archeological site in Portugal is trying to change that, thougha€!. Victor 
Vicente and Pedro Almeidaa€! are the brains behind this operation. In May 2021, they placed 400 
kilos of locally caught and gutted sardines, 129 kilos of salt and 320 liters of spring water in 
one of TrA3iaa€™ s ancient Roman stone tanks, where
archeologists and researchers allowed the ingredients to ferment for six monthsa€L The resounding 
positivity from chefs and researchers around the project and its results has everyone excited about 
its possibilities. a€oelt tastes really good and the experiment was great,a€D Victor says, telling 
us this batch of garum is much more balanced than the
ones    they attempted at their restauranta€’’perhaps because the tanks absorb heat during the day, 
keeping the ingredients warm even at night, which helps maintain the fermentation processa€!

Ryan Avent: The Big Picture on Inflation: a€~Looking at bond markets, it strikes me as difficult to 
conclude that the Fed has lost credibilitya€!. Breakeven rates of inflation arena€™ t flying 
upwarda€!. In November, the figures on consumer price inflation came in very hot, well above 
consensus. In response, the five-year breakeven rate ticked up, but
did not soar, while fed fund futures increased the outlook for interest-rate hikes in 2022, but not 
dramatically. Indeed, it seems to me that movements in breakevens in recent months overwhelmingly 
reflect shifts in realized inflation, and not some growing skepticism of the Fed. Indeed, one could 
argue that an overreaction to inflation now, under unusual
circumstances and while the economy remains well short of pre-pandemic employment levels, could 
undermine the Feda€™ s long-run effort to persuade markets that it can boost a depressed economy in 
a pincha€!

The big picture on inflation

Next year will mark 15 years since the first stirrings of the global financial crisis and also, as 
it happens, since I began writing for The Economist. I started on a freelance basis, writing for 
the economics blog, at a time when Freakonomics-style papers were all the rage and the stakes of 
the arguments seemed incredibly small. But soon enough all of a€!
