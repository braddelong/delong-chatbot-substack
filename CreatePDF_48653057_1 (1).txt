Ground Truths

Where do we stand with Omicron?

There has been a flood of new data in the past few weeks regarding Omicrona€™ s impact throughout 
the world, and specifically on the influence of vaccination (with or without boosters) on 
symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, including durability. Ita€™ s actually 
remarkable how much and how quickly we are learning about Omicron and our abilita€!

California looks, luckily, to be about two-thirds of the way from the U.S. average to Canada 
(although, needless to say, nowhere near the effectiveness of Australia or Japan): actually wearing 
masks, trying to stay six-feet apart inside, and not being dorks about places with low ventilation 
is worth a lot.
The most heartbreaking thing is how weak, among the easily-grifted, the a€oel should get vaccinated 
and boosted to keep from giving it to my elderly and immunocompromised neighborsaCD thread is. True 
psychopathy.

Consider: On September 26,2020, now-Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett allowed the Trump White 
House to host a crowded party for her. The risks to her from having this nomination party were not 
that large. But, approximately, 30 people caught COVID-19 at that party.

With a fourteen-day infection cycle, those 30 then gave it to 50 in mid-October, who then gave it 
to 80 in early November, who then gave it to 150 at the end of November, who then gave it to 200 
more in mid-December, 200 in early-January, and 200 in mid-January. Then it drops offa€”another 620 
between then and now.
A total of 1530 people.

And thata€™ s if the guests at Amy Coney BarrettaC™ s party and their contacts behaved like normal 
Americans. They may not havea€”it might be much, much more. Or it might be much fewer: maybe their 
showing up for a crowded indoor party was a one-time thing, and they thought better of their 
behavior and changed after they left the party.

Odds are that, of those 1530 people, 15 are now dead. 15 people who would now be alive had Supreme 
Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett said a€oel dona€™ t think thata€™ s a great ideaa€D when having a 
big party for her was mooted. Maybe it is morea€”maybe the chains of infection went to elderly 
Trumpists. Maybe it is lessa€”maybe a good many of those who got infected would have gotten the 
disease anyway in the winter or the future, and that for
many of the 15 it just cut their life short by 4 months or so. I cana€™ t tell.

But 15 is the number to keep in your head. Amy Coney Barrett, I guarantee, does not think of 
herself as some ca. 1450 Mexica priestess watching her hench-priests sacrifice 15 people with 
obsidian knives on one of the pyramids of Tenochtitlan to celebrate her ascendancy to power.
Does she know their names? Does she light fifteen candles every Sunday, and pray on her knees that 
if any of those fifteen died unshriven that their sins descend upon her rather than upon them?

Somehow I doubt ita€!

Markets are buzzing about Fed hikes. But nothing about market pricing is
hawkish. Markets just front-loaded Fed hikes (green), keeping the terminal
rate      at 2.1% in 2024, which is BELOW the Fed's estimate of neutral (2.5%). In
an economy that's clearly overheating, this is dovish!

Occoquan, Virginia's Embrace of Old and New

William County about 40 minutes south of Washington, D.C. Like so many quaint little towns, 
Occoquan is small, exclusive, a little boutiquey, and has traded whatever commercial purpose it

Exploiting Racism to Save Himself (audio)

Listen now (9 min) I Dear Friends, As I state below and in this audio post, "Trumpa€™ s threats 
made clear his intention to trigger his mob when the rule of law finally finds him. This cannot be 
treated blithely, with low-key patience or with the courtesy typically afforded a former 
president.a€D As much as we may like to move on or look away, the danger this represents must be

Inflation is forgetting

The other day, I was writing about inflation and the national debt, and a commenter asked me 
whether inflation had caused the debt to go down in real terms. I checked, and to my surprise, I 
found it had! From the first quarter of 2021 to the third quarter, despite two huge Covid relief 
bills a€” the $0.9 trillion bill in December 2020 and Bidena€™ s $1.9 trillion bill in March a€” 
the national debt actually fell in inflation-adjusted termsa€!
