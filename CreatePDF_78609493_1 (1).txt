Review of Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Twentieth Century
Author: J. Bradford DeLong

Publisher: Basic Books, 2022

J. Bradford DeLonga€™ s long-awaited book Slouching Towards Utopia is finally here, but despite its 
door-stopping size of 180,000 words, ita€™ s surprisingly easy and breezy to read. Delonga€™ s 
politics are unabashedly left-wing, having served in the Clinton administration, and has taught 
economics at the
University of California at Berkeley since 1993. Professor DeLong is a polymath who knows much 
about economics, history, and philosophy, and here his talents are on full display. But talent 
often comes with a healthy ego. He a€oeflambeed no fewer than 11 people as the stupidest man alive 
,a€D as one reviewer
described. This includes his famous feud with the great economic historian Niall Ferguson. DeLong 
gained a loyal following from his endless blogging. That may explain why it took almost 30 years to 
finish his opus magnum.

But finish it, he did, and ita€™ s a fantastic read, if not a bit weird in places with an 
unapologetic leftist bias. (No surprise here, given that DeLong was inspired by socialist historian 
Eric HobsbawmaC™ s classic book on the twentieth century entitled The Age of Extreme, which goes 
from 1914 to the fall of the Soviet
Union in 1991.) In no other book on economic history would you find the poetry of Rudyard Kipling 
or the colourful career of Herbert Hoover, a description of the neurosis of Nikola Tesla or witty 
allusions to Greek mythology. And herea€™ s the best part: you dona€™ t have to be an economist or 
historian to enjoy this
book or reach for the smelling salts to revive you from boredom.

His a€oegrand narrativea€D is that the long 20th century started in 1870 and lasted until 2010. The 
year 1870 stands out as the moment in time when production and productivity were high enough to 
begin raising living standards. Until then, Thomas Malthusa€™ s a€cedevila€D was at work where 
population growth
subsumed any improvement in technology growth.

It took almost 100 years from the start of the Industrial Revolution to see the benefits of an 
economic miracle that finally got off the ground, dragging part of the world into the modern age. 
It was a slight shift at first, but the momentum of technological change gradually transformed life 
on earth freeing humanity from
hand-to-mouth misery. Before 1870,70 percent of humanity lived on a standard of living of $3 a day, 
a level of income that hadna€™ t changed for thousands of years, to a daily average of $15 in 
poorer countries and $130 in richer ones. These numbers dona€™ t consider the vast improvement in 
the quality of goods to
the point that even the poor have access to cell phones and health care. Nobel economist Angus 
Deaton said, a€oechildren in sub-Saharan Africa are more likely to survive to age five than English 
children born in 1918.a€D The poor may not always be with us.

DeLong argues that the miracle behind economic growth was the happy coincidence of three factors: 
globalization, the invention of the large modern corporation, and the industrial laboratory. He 
admits these werena€™ t the only factors, but he identifies them as the most important in pushing 
us toward utopia. Ita€™ s a
puzzle why he left out property rights or the quality of public institutions and, perhaps most 
important, the rise of liberalism.

According to economic historian Deirdre McCloskey, the gift of equality under British law, where 
everyone had the opportunity (and right) to a€oehave a goa€D, improved the machinery of production 
and led to a better life. Free markets dona€™ t guarantee success, but they allow anyone to get 
into the game for ill or
good. With that freedom, we find that talent isna€™ t restricted to any class, gender, or race.

Throughout the book there are surprisesa€”both good and bad. Despite DeLonga€™ s respect for 
leftist politics and evident admiration for Karl Marx, he admits Marx was wrong on bourgeois 
capitalism. a€oelt is simply not the case that market economies produce ever-rising inequality and 
ever-increasing
immiseration.aCn (As an aside, DeLong hardly uses the word a€oecapitalisma€C and prefers the term 
a€oemarket economya€D, which is a plus in his favour.) On the negative side, DeLong was wrong in 
his spurious attack on the political scientist Charles Murrya€™ s 1984 ground-breaking book Losing 
Ground.

Ground.
DeLong  blames racism for the plight of the black American family. At the same time, Murray, along 
with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, showed that the cause of poor black performance was 
disastrous public policy.

So why are we now slouching to utopia? His answer is a world dominated by too much market economy 
or what he calls the a€oeMammon of Unrighteousness.a€D Here DeLong splits the world into the 
pro-free market philosophy of economist and Nobel Prize winner Friedrich von Hayek and the 
Hungarian-Canadian
critic of laissez-faire capitalism Karl Polanyi. Slouching Towards Utopztzhighlights the push and 
pull of ideas of both thinkers, coming down on the side of Polanyia€™ s view of the world, while 
Hayek is exposed to DeLonga€™ s rough treatment.

Skipping over 140 years, we come to 2010 and the decline of prosperitya€™ s arc. Why 2010? The 
author has no specific answer or dramatic event that brought the miracle of growth to an end. But 
he does make some guesses, such as the loss of Americaa€™ s hegemony and exceptionalism, the 
misadventures of endless
wars in the Middle East after 9/11, and the financial meltdown of 2008. The economic pie was 
getting smaller as the productivity engine sputtered to a crawl. We now have a smaller economic 
piea€”divided to benefit the plutocratsa€”thus bringing a€oethe long twentieth centurya€™ s story 
to a close.a€D

One could have ended the history of the twentieth century with the same grim news in the late 70s 
with stagflation and high levels of unemployment. Or the 80s with interest rates over 20 percent 
while the economy was ravaged by high inflation and the stock market crash of 1987. How about the 
collapse of the dot coms
in the late 90s?

Did DeLong jump the gun on the end of growth? After two full years of economic shutdown from CO 
VID, Western technology, in record time, came up with an effective vaccine while AI and biomedical 
engineering are just getting started with promises of extraordinary breakthroughs. DeLong probably 
would agree that
the endpoint was arbitrary and that economists make lousy prognosticators, especially about the 
future.

Leaving aside Professor DeLonga€™ s sympathy for more government, it would be a shame to miss out 
on a great readjust because of onea€™ s political differences.
