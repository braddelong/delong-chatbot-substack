Trump has failed. But neofascism remains a mighty powerful force. If James Robinson would talk to Trumpists, he would recognize that Trump did “deliver the goods”—they imagine that, before the coming of the plague, they were enjoying an unparalleled economic boom; and they are not mistaken to think that Trump delivered the hate he had promised against immigrants, against uppity Blacks who did not know and stay in what Trumpists continue to think is their proper place, and against rootless cosmopolites. The only problem is that the center of the electorate is not—or is not yet—Trumpian. And, for some reason, the knives that actors from James Comey to Dean Baquet used to stab Hillary Rodham Clinton in the back failed to hit Joe Biden’s back this time, for lots of reasons:</p><blockquote><p><strong>James A. Robinson</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Why Trumpian Populism Failed</em>: ‘US democracy remains vulnerable… owing to many Americans’ lack of commitment to democratic institutions. While Trump worked to de-institutionalize America and enrich himself while in office, the Republican Party either sat on its hands or in some cases applauded…. At the end of the day, Trump’s “America First” was mostly posturing, because he couldn’t deliver real improvements in the lives of his base. All successful autocrats—like former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, postwar Argentine President Juan Perón, or current Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni—somehow “deliver the goods” for their core constituencies. Trump delivered, but only to the rich, by cutting taxes and regulations. His symbolic gestures won’t endure, and his “Make America Great Again” slogan is destined for burial at the back of millions of American closets. </p><p>Republicans would be wise to consider this. Instead, much of the party, both in Congress and at the state and local level, still clings to the false narrative of election fraud and support for the insurrectionists, or advances the notion that the storming of the Capitol&nbsp;was staged to undermine Trump. This is deeply concerning. Perón was able to rule as he did after World War II because increased presidential meddling&nbsp;in Argentina’s Supreme Court and political institutions had eroded these bodies over the previous 15 years. Most Americans do not want to go down this path, even if many of their elected political leaders do…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-democratic-institutions-prevailed-over-trump-this-time-by-james-a-robinson-2021-03&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-02-13-sa?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-02-13-sa?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Charles West</strong>:&nbsp;<em>What is a History Lecture For?</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="http://turbulentpriests.group.shef.ac.uk/what-is-a-history-lecture-for/">http://turbulentpriests.group.shef.ac.uk/what-is-a-history-lecture-for/</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://turbulentpriests.group.shef.ac.uk/what-is-a-history-lecture-for-part-ii-transcripts/">http://turbulentpriests.group.shef.ac.uk/what-is-a-history-lecture-for-part-ii-transcripts/</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Lauren Aldredge</strong>: <em>Getting Started with mmhmm</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RlaqfJoFkM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RlaqfJoFkM</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Wikipedia</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Tiger Lake</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Lake">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Lake</a>&gt; |&nbsp;<em>Rocket Lake</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lake">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lake</a>&gt; |&nbsp;<em>Alder Lake (microprocessor)</em>&nbsp; &lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder_Lake_(microprocessor)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder_Lake_(microprocessor)</a>&gt; |&nbsp;<em>List of Intel CPU microarchitectures </em>&lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_CPU_microarchitectures">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_CPU_microarchitecture</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Robert M.

Recent graduates in economic history appear to have roughly similar prospects to those of other economists in the economics job market.

(2) It can lose sight of the multiplicity of human interactions across varied, but always interconnected, spheres of life—political, social, aesthetic, spiritual, or communal, among others—that affect our attempts to solve specific economic problems.
