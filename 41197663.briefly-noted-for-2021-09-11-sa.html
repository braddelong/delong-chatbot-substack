Fully vaccinated people are about five times less likely to become infected with delta, 10 times less likely to be hospitalized with COVID–19 from delta, and 11 times less likely to die from the variant…. Fully vaccinated people were about 11 times less likely to get an infection in the pre-delta period, compared with the unvaccinated (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 7.8 to 15.8). That ratio dropped to 4.6 less likely in the post-delta period (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 2.5 to 8.5). For hospitalizations prior to delta, fully vaccinated people were 13 times less likely to wind up in the hospital than the unvaccinated (confidence interval of 11.3 to 15.6). After delta, that ratio dropped slightly to 10 times less likely (confidence interval of 8.1 to 13.3). The fully vaccinated were 16.6 times less likely to die of COVID–19 prior to delta (confidence interval of 13.5 to 20.4) and 11.3 times less likely to die after delta (confidence interval of 9.1 to 13.9)…. For vaccine protection against infection, they estimated that effectiveness dropped from 91 percent to 78 percent with delta. For protection against hospitalizations, effectiveness appeared to go from 92 percent to 90 percent, and for death, from 94 percent to 91 percent. One troubling note was that the declines in protection were more pronounced in older age groups, with those ages 65 and older seeing larger drops…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/unvaccinated-are-5x-more-likely-to-catch-delta-11x-more-likely-to-die/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/unvaccinated-are-5x-more-likely-to-catch-delta-11x-more-likely-to-die/</a>&gt;</p><p></p><h3><strong>PLUS</strong>:</h3><p><strong>Conor Kelly</strong>:&nbsp;<em>’A pretty massive gap in COVID case</em>&nbsp;rates has opened up between counties that voted for Trump last Nov and those that voted for Biden.

In hindsight, this setting left policymakers with too little room to cut interest rates when they want to fight recessions. Many researchers have noted that if central banks raised their inflation targets—either individually or in concert—they could do a better job in the long run of keeping inflation near its target and the workforce fully employed. This Policy Brief highlights an additional and less-noted consequence of raising the inflation target modestly: The economy could enjoy a temporary but substantial boom in employment and output as it adjusted to the increase in the target. Model simulations suggest that if the target were lifted to 3 percent, the unemployment rate could average 3⁄4 percentage point or more below its sustainable level during the first 15 years after the higher target is announced…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/documents/pb21-19.pdf">https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/documents/pb21-19.pdf</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Jeet Heer</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Robert E.
