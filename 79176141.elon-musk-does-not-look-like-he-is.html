He has drawn lessons as to what plays to run. And so now he is trying to rerun his plays because they worked in the past. But he is trying to rerun them in an enviroment where they are unlikely to work. </p><p>Engineers at Tesla and SpaceX have done great things. Auto competitors took the plague-years chip shortage not as a problem to be solved but as a convenient way to organize a cartel to cut their production, and so did Tesla a great favor. But those did not make Musk a 100-billionaire. Musk became a 100-billionaire via social-media celebrity and the meme-stock channel—not by virtue of owning large chunks of companies that saw the greatest jumps ever in the rationally-expected present value of their properly discounted future earnings. Think of him as a walking, talking, tweeting DogeCoin:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Matt Yglesias: </strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/elon-musk-is-the-latest-victim-of">Elon Musk is the latest victim of the online ragetrap</a>: <em>Don’t spend all day nursing grievances and making yourself miserable</em>: ‘The other day, Elon Musk joked on Twitter that “my pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.” It’s a mean spirited joke from Musk, who we already know enjoys mean jokes about trans people—the <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/03/21/twitter-suspends-babylon-bee-over-rachel-levine-man-of-the-year-title/">suspension of the Babylon Bee for making a mean joke about Rachel Levine</a> was an important motivator of Musk’s decision to buy Twitter…. The pronouns thing references a genuine dispute in American politics and culture. Small numbers of people really are using they/them pronouns or socially transitioning from she/her to he/him, and if someone wants to spend their time being angry about that then I think that’s a weird decision, but they are, in fact, choosing to be angry about a thing that is happening…. But if you’re sitting here in mid-December 2022 getting mad at Fauci and Biden for imposing repeated rounds of lockdowns, then you’re getting mad about something you made up.

Fiscal History</strong></em><strong>:</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>James Surowiecki: </strong><a href="https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/taming-the-economy/">Taming the Economy</a>: <em>The story of fiscal and monetary policy over the last 60 years is the story of what government can and should do to the economy</em>: ‘It’s hard to imagine a better moment for Alan Blinder’s new book, <em>A Monetary and Fiscal History of the United States, 1961-2021</em>…. That book offers pretty much exactly what the title promises, a blow-by-blow chronological history of the evolution of American monetary and fiscal policy over the last 60 years, along with short biographical sketches of key figures in that history, and sharp analytical riffs…. [The] narrative is, on the whole, one of progress, however halting. That’s especially the case when it comes to monetary policy…. One of the most striking things about Blinder’s book, in fact, is its reminder that the Fed in the 1960s and ‘70s seemed to be very much flying by the seat of its pants….. </p><p>The Federal Reserve also used to be far more politicized. The exemplar of this, in Blinder’s account, was Arthur Burns, head of the Fed under Nixon, who kept the President (who was his friend) in the loop about interest rate cuts and, Blinder argues, helped engineer a miniboom before the 1972 election in part in order to get Nixon reelected. But it wasn’t just Nixon…. That changed, really, with Bill Clinton, who despite being angry at Alan Greenspan for raising rates heading into the 1994 midterm election was convinced to hold his tongue (in public, at least). This continued for two decades, until that norm, like so many others, was shattered by Donald Trump…. </p><p>The Fed has been more patient and less anxious to raise interest rates than it was in the 1980s and early ‘90s. And while we may in part be paying for that now with higher inflation, it’s also the reason unemployment before the pandemic fell to 3.5 percent, lower than it’s been at any point in the last 50 years, and why it returned to that low this year lower than it’s been at any point in the last 50 years. That’s made life materially better for millions of workers who might now be without a job if the Fed had raised interest rates too soon. If the story Blinder tells of monetary policy is, generally speaking, the story of the Fed becoming more technocratic and systematic in its approach, the story of fiscal policy over the last 60 years is, predictably, much messier...</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 50% off a group subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48"><span>Get 50% off a group subscription</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Very Briefly Noted:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Martin Sandbu: </strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b323e627-2de9-4d16-8adb-a08715bf3151">Central banks should beware mistaking wage rises for an inflation problem</a>: ‘Profound changes in labour markets since the pandemic may mean that many workers and companies are more productive…</p></li><li><p><strong>Bill Dudley: </strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-12-19/the-fed-s-inflation-objective-trumps-what-markets-want?srnd=opinion">Investors Would Be Better Off Believing the Fed</a>: ‘If markets remain optimistic, the central bank will just have to tighten more to achieve its inflation objective…</p></li><li><p><strong>Bill Gross: </strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c3cb8378-cac0-4bb1-be7c-170ca002f9fb">The Fed needs to stop raising rates</a>: ‘With too much hidden leverage around, the central bank should wait to see if the punch bowl has been sufficiently drained…</p></li><li><p><strong>Leticia Miranda:</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-12-19/amazon-is-ubiquitous-but-it-isn-t-invincible-anymore?srnd=opinion">Amazon Is Ubiquitous.

What started as a sound idea has become an escape from something else entirely: reality. In return for the promise of superior returns, private funds typically “lock in” client money for up to 10 years, then report to clients much less frequently than public funds do…. In the new tight money era, with losses spreading across asset classes, private channels have become a way for money managers to conceal losses from clients… who are often content in the dark… </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Dan Drezner: </strong><a href="https://danieldrezner.substack.com/p/the-possible-limits-of-american-polarization?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">The Possible Limits of American Polarization</a>: ‘With Democrats in the Senate and the White House… Republicans] have fewer bargaining chips to play.
