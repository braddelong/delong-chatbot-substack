Yet they would then go on to the next question: Why, with such godlike powers to command nature and organize ourselves, have we done so little to build a truly human world, to approach within sight of any of our utopias? </p><p>As of 2010, distrust in America’s hegemonic role had been cemented by Middle Eastern misadventures, and confidence that America was in some ways a plausible model was being replaced by a fear that in most ways it was a horrible warning. Discontent had grown with exploding income and wealth inequality that few even of its advocates associated with any boost to economic growth. The Great Recession of 2008-10 had revealed the emptiness of claims that the neoliberal technocrats had finally gotten the problems of economic management right. The political institutions of the global north continued to fail to even begin to grapple with the problem of global warming. Standard measurements told us that the underlying engine of productivity growth had begun to stall. </p><p>And in 2010 the great and good of the global north were about to fail to prioritize a rapid restoration of full employment. They would fail to understand and manage the discontents that would bring neofascist and fascist-adjacent politicians to prominence worldwide in the 2010s. Thus the long twentieth century’s story was over.</p><p>Perhaps it did not have to end then, in 2010. Perhaps the bright future that many had envisioned—the idea that rapid equitable growth could be restored as the information-technology boom roared ahead—was always illusory. Or perhaps the opportunity could have been grasped, had chance and contingency turned out otherwise. </p><p>Perhaps if in 2008 the United States had elected an FDR, he (or she) could have worked a miracle—as the original FDR had, unexpectedly, done in 1933 and after. Perhaps even in 2016 the dry bones of the long twentieth-century pattern of rapid productivity growth, governments that could manage the creative-destruction transformations such growth brought to the world, and American exceptionalism could have been made to live again. But it turned out that post-2010 America would instead elect Donald Trump, and western Europe would do little better, ending possibilities of revivification.</p><p>That my take is this gloomy makes it much more urgent that I engage with and absorb <strong>Azeem Azhar</strong>: <em>The Exponential Age: How Accelerating Technology is Transforming Business, Politics &amp; Society</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exponential-Age-Accelerating-Technology-Transforming/dp/1635769094">https://www.amazon.com/Exponential-Age-Accelerating-Technology-Transforming/dp/1635769094</a>&gt;. For his take is close to the very opposite of mine:</p><blockquote><p><strong>IN 2020, AMAZON</strong> turned 26 years old. Over the previous quarter of a century, the company had transformed shopping…. At the heart of its success is a staggering $36 billion research and development budget in 2019, used to develop everything from robots to smart home assistants. This sum… is not far off the UK government's annual budget for research and development…. Ten years earlier, Amazon’s research budget had been $1.2 billion. Over the course of the next decade, the firm increased its annual R&amp;D budget by about 44 per cent every year…. In the process, Amazon created a chasm between the old world and the new. The approach of traditional business was to rely on models that had succeeded yesterday. They were based on a strategy that tomorrow might be a little different now, but not markedly so. This kind of linear thinking, rooted in the assumption that change would take decades, not months, may have worked in the past—but not anymore. Amazon understood the nature of the Exponential Age…. Those that couldn't keep up would be undone at remarkable speed. This divergence between the old and the new is one example of what I call the exponential gap….</p><p>In the Exponential Age, one primary input for a company is its ability to process information. One of the main costs to process that data is computation. And the cost of computation didn’t rise each year, it declined rapidly…. If an organisation needs to do something that uses computation, and that task is too expensive today, it probably won’t be too expensive in a couple of years…. Organisations that understood this deflation, and planned for it, became well-positioned to take advantage of the Exponential Age…. Companies that didn't adapt to exponential technology shifts, like much of the newspaper publishing industry, didn't stand a chance…. Consider for a moment what it actually feels like to live in the Exponential Age—the answer, as many readers will know, is bewildering. Someone like me, born in the early 1970s, has experienced wave after wave of innovations. From the landline to the mobile, dialup internet to mobile internet, vinyl records to CDs to MP3s to streaming. I’ve owned the Bee Gees’ <em>Saturday Night Fever</em> on at least five different formats…</p><p>The problem is not just that we underestimate exponential growth. Experts who are mindful of the power of exponentiality can also be prone to overestimate its power…. A slight error in your basic assumptions can throw your whole prediction off…. And these problems of underestimation and overestimation are confounded by a third difficulty… “mis-estimation”…. The primary cause of the exponential gap is our failure to predict the cadence of exponential change, the secondary cause is our consequent failure to adapt to it. As the speed of change increases, our society remoulds itself at a much slower pace….</p><p>This is an urgent need. In the Exponential Age the institutions that govern our economies will cease to be fit for purpose. New technologies will clash with our existing expectations, rules and systems. We need radical thinking to prevent the exponential gap eroding the fabric of our society…</p><p>[…]</p><p>Acknowledging that the direction of technology is not preordained doesn’t amount to saying that technology isn’t transformative. Elsewhere, Kranzberg writes that technology “is neither good, nor bad, nor is it neutral.” Like it or not, technology brings change. And so the second stage in our shift in mindset involves acceptance…. Chaotic, unpredictable developments can be for the good—it’s our responsibility to direct them where we can and manage their surprises when we can’t. As the Exponential Age accelerates, general purpose technologies will affect all of our most cherished institutions…. Technology is unpredictable. It is hard to say how new innovations will transform our society, as they constantly interact with our approaches to business, work, place, conflict and politics.</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/exponential-age-azeem-azhar">https://www.wired.co.uk/article/exponential-age-azeem-azhar</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Certainly from here in Berkeley on the outskirts of Silicon Valley it feels as if Azeem Azhar is right—that humanity’s technical competence to manipulate nature and organize and communicate with ourselves is increasing faster than it ever has before, faster than the 35 years or so it took for each of the four doublings of human technological competence from 1870 to 2010, and then we have to look back from 1870 to 1600 for the previous doubling (and then back from 1600 to 200 for the doubling before that). But the real-wage numbers we have suggest that for the working and middle class real wages and salaries have for 15 years been increasing at an average rate of only 0.5%/year, compared to 2.0%/year or so in the neoliberal age from 1975-2005, and 3.0%/year or more in the 1945-1975 Thirty Glorious Years of the preceding social-democratic age. Yes, working- and middle-class people today have access to awesome electronic gadgets and mind-blowing frontier medical therapies, but these have been counterbalanced by the standard indicia of middle-class making-it—a house in a good neighborhood with an easy commute, assurance that if your children study hard and turn out to be smart they can graduate from a good college without a huge debt load, and the ability to look the overclass in the face without feeling that they are beings of a different order—harder to grasp.</p><p>A bet that the wage-growth slowdown and the status-anxiety creation that our standard statistics and measurements tell us is in fact masking a much more hopeful, exponential-growth reality is certainly one that can be made. Whether it is true or not depends on how fast our leading-sector technologies grow exponentially, and how many doublings they have before demand for their services becomes inelastic and they cease to be important, or they simply run into the upper end of their S-curve logistic and converge to their respective anecdotes. So far, however, I am not convinced. At times I see Silicon Valley as engaged in brain-hacking to glue people’s eyeballs to screens so that they can be sold ads, and if that is what we use our technologies for it would better if they did not develop so fast. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-azeem-azhar-the-exponential?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-azeem-azhar-the-exponential?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Forthcoming September 6, 2022, from Basic Books:</h2><p><em>Slouching Towards Utopia: A History of the Long Twentieth Century</em>: <strong>Paragraph 6: </strong>As the genius Dr. Jekyll-like Austro-English-Chicagoan moral philosopher Friedrich August von Hayek observed, the market economy crowdsources—incentivizes and coordinates at the grassroots—solutions to the problems it sets.

If it was just transmissibility, older viruses would continue to spread, even if somewhat more slowly, but that’s not what’s happening. Older variants are declining in absolute case count suggesting that there is competition between variants. How can variants compete with each other? Immune escape. A variant that evades the immunity induced by a different variant can continue to spread while spread of the old variant is limited to only hosts who have not been infected or vaccinated…. Other viruses also evolve to escape prevailing immunity. E.g. we have studied immune escape in influenza viruses extensively Can immune escape be important if we are still far from “herd immunity”?… R0 is an artificial construct, and it’s as much a property of the population as it is of the virus….

The White House then gives it to Senator Lee and others on January 2…. By January 3, after Pence meets with the Senate Parliamentarian, it’s clear he’s not coming along. On January 4, Pence is in Georgia for a rally, but once he flies back, Trump calls him to the Oval Office…. “I’m getting guidance that says I can’t,” Pence tells Trump and Eastman, who is there. “Listen. Listen to John,” Trump replies. As Eastman and Trump pressure Pence and Pence’s aides/lawyers, the rest of the Trump White House is in full-steam ahead mode that same day…. Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is working with Trump this whole time, and we show him meeting with Graham and Giuliani on how to push Trump’s efforts along…. We are [now] learning more about both Meadows and that key day, January 4th. Think of it as the set-up day for the eve of the insurrection, Jan. 5, when Bannon and Giuliani work from the Willard and Trump pressures Pence, 1 on 1, in the Oval Office…. Meadows was in possession of a PowerPoint that echoed the Eastman memo. (The origin story of the PP is a key reporting target.) &lt;<a href="https://theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/10/trump-powerpoint-mark-meadows-capitol-attack">https://theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/10/trump-powerpoint-mark-meadows-capitol-attack</a>&gt;…. The pressure on Pence is Level 10/10, you have not only the principals leaning on the Vice President, but numerous documents circulating to make the case: Eastman memos, PowerPoints, and Jenna Ellis memos &lt;<a href="https://cnn.com/2021/12/10/politics/jenna-ellis-trump-lawyer-memos-pence-biden/index.html">https://cnn.com/2021/12/10/politics/jenna-ellis-trump-lawyer-memos-pence-biden/index.html</a>&gt;. But despite all of these documents and PowerPoints, the most revealing thing of this period isn’t a document. It’s what he says to Pence on January 5. At the end of the day, Trump isn’t looking to these documents to make his case. He looks to the gathering mob in the streets. “If these people say you had the power, wouldn’t you want to?” Trump asked. “I wouldn’t want any one person to have that authority,” Pence said. “But wouldn’t it almost be cool to have that power?” Trump asked. “No,” Pence said…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/costareports/status/1469680144726040577&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;(thread) Based on our reporting, Eastman begins drafting his memo in late Dec. and Trump WH has it by the new year.
