And what compels the <em>New York Review of Books</em> to publish it?</p><p>“Tankies gonna tank” is a truism:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tariq Ali</strong>: <em>The Churchill Cult</em>: ‘The English cult of Winston Churchill… near-absurdist… backlash from anticolonial critics… received a further boost in March this year…. Russian president Vladimir Putin was assigned the role of Hitler. Zelensky took the part of Churchill. Members of Parliament from all four parties drooled with pleasure. NATO-land may have conferred a temporary sainthood on Zelensky, but we should not overlook how misplaced his analogy is. The spinal cord of the Third Reich was, after all, crushed at Stalingrad and Kursk by the determination and courage of the Red Army (in which many Ukrainians fought, in far greater numbers than those who deserted to Hitler). The strength of the US war industry did the rest…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2022/04/18/the-churchill-cult-by-jingo/">https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2022/04/18/the-churchill-cult-by-jingo/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>I really do wish I had more of an insight into the… peculiar psychology… that leads somebody today to sneer at Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians.</p><p>There was, after all, at least a kind of dishonorable grandeur in being a stooge for Stalin—if you sincerely thought that he was a brutal and unworthy standard-bearer for what would become a real utopia sometime in the future; or that you had to choose between totalitarianisms because liberalism’s day was over, and Stalin was a lesser evil than Hitler.</p><p>There is neither honor nor grandeur in being a useful idiot for Vladimir Putin.</p><p>All honor to the soldiers of the Red Army who won the decisive battles of Stalingrad and Kursk, and all honor to the workers of Magnitogorsk who built their tanks, and to the peasants enserfed on their collective farms who fed them. But you have to either be lying or have worked hard to keep yourself ignorant to think that “the spinal cord of the Third Reich was… crushed at Stalingrad and Kursk…. The strength of the US war industry did the rest.”</p><p>Up to the end of 1942, Nazi war industry produced 8600 medium and heavy tanks. Thereafter they produced 29,500. Yes, the Nazis lost about 1000 tanks at Stalingrad and Kursk each, but the Nazi army was still far more deadly after those battles than before.</p><p>Anyone even slightly well-informed about World War II in Europe who is not a liar says that all three of the major allies were essential. Without Russia, there was no path to victory for Britain and the U.S. (save, perhaps, for the one that turned Germany into a sea of radioactive glass). Without the U.S., it is very difficult to see any path to victory at all for Britain and Russia. And without Britain’s holding out from summer 1940 to summer 1941, Russia cannot hold when the Nazis attack, and the Americans never get into the war in Europe at all for they have no place to stage their army and air force to.</p><p>Without Churchill, Britain does not hold out.</p><p>But we did have Churchill, and we did have a British Labour Party, headed by Clement Attlee, that was strongly anti-fascist and insisted that Churchill had the government, rather than someone who had not been an out-and-out opponent of appeasement. The British Labour Party was right.</p><p>Churchill was a great asshole, but he was the asshole that the world needed in the summer of 1940.</p><p class="button-wrapper"

But if the dangers of war and tyranny are removed, there is no doubt that science and cooperation can bring in the next few years, certainly in the next few decades, to the world, newly taught in the sharpening school of war, an expansion of material well-being beyond anything that has yet occurred in human experience. Now, at this sad and breathless moment, we are plunged in the hunger and distress which are the aftermath of our stupendous struggle; but this will pass and may pass quickly, and there is no reason except human folly or sub-human crime which should deny to all the nations the inauguration and enjoyment of an age of plenty. I have often used words… from… Bourke Cockran, “There is enough for all. The earth is a generous mother; she will provide in plentiful abundance food for all her children if they will but cultivate her soil in justice and peace.” So far I feel that we are in full agreement…</p></blockquote><p>It warns of the necessity of building the Temple of Peace, and welcomes Russia—even Stalin’s Russia—into it as a peer great power, and states a willingness on the part of the western allies to establish lasting friendship with “the valiant Russian people… [our] wartime comrade[s]” for whom we must and do have “strong admiration and regard”. Moreover, there is the will to persevere in the attempt to establish such friendship “through many differences and rebuffs”:</p><blockquote><p>I spoke earlier, ladies and gentlemen, of the Temple of Peace…. It may collapse…. Dark ages may return, the Stone Age may return on the gleaming wings of science, and what might now shower immeasurable material blessings upon mankind, may even bring about its total destruction. Beware, I say; time may be short. Do not let us take the course of allowing events to drift…. </p><p>I have a strong admiration and regard for the valiant Russian people and for my wartime comrade, Marshall Stalin. There is deep sympathy and goodwill in Britain—and I doubt not here also—towards the peoples of all the Russias and a resolve to persevere through many differences and rebuffs in establishing lasting friendships. We understand the Russian need to be secure…. We welcome Russia to her rightful place among the leading nations… her flag upon the seas… constant, frequent and growing contacts between the Russian people and our own people…</p></blockquote><p>And only then, after the speech is half done, do we hear:</p><blockquote><p>It is my duty to place before you certain facts…. From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across the Continent…. [In] the Soviet sphere… all are subject… to a very high and, in some cases, increasing measure of control from Moscow…. Police governments are prevailing in nearly every case, and so far, except in Czechoslovakia, there is no true democracy…. Whatever conclusions may be drawn from these facts—and facts they are—this is certainly not the Liberated Europe we fought to build up. Nor is it one which contains the essentials of permanent peace…. In front of the iron curtain… are other causes for anxiety…. Communist parties or fifth columns constitute a growing challenge and peril to Christian civilization…. The outlook is also anxious in the Far East and especially in Manchuria. The Agreement which was made at Yalta, to which I was a party, was extremely favorable to Soviet Russia…</p></blockquote><p>But, Churchill says, hot war or cold war can be avoided in a straightforward manner. How? By the American-British alliance, and then by diplomacy:</p><blockquote><p>I repulse the idea that a new war is inevitable; still more that it is imminent…. I do not believe that Soviet Russia desires war. What they desire is the fruits of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrines…. They will not be removed by mere waiting to see what happens; nor will they be removed by a policy of appeasement. What is needed is a settlement, and the longer this is delayed, the more difficult it will be and the greater our dangers will become…. Our Russian friends and Allies… there is nothing for which they have less respect than for weakness…. If the Western Democracies stand together in strict adherence to the principles will be immense and no one is likely to molest them…. We must not let [world war] happen again. This can only be achieved by reaching now, in 1946, by reaching a good understanding on all points with Russia under the general authority of the United Nations Organization….</p></blockquote><p>Then, once that “good understanding” with Russia based on the non-weakness of the alliance of the United States and British Empire is reached:</p><blockquote><p>There will be no quivering, precarious balance of power to offer its temptation to ambition or adventure. On the contrary there will be an overwhelming assurance of security…. If all British moral and material forces and convictions are joined with your own in fraternal association, the highroads of the future will be clear, not only for our time, but for a century to come.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Paragraphs:</strong></h3><p>But, Noah, the Right wing’s economic plan was completely wrong. “Starving the beast” (a) creamed public investment and substantially slowed productivity growth, and (b) in a high interest-rate capital-scarce environment, the crowding-out of private investments by government deficits was a very real and damaging thing. Plus the dollar cycles absolutely creamed American manufacturing, and lost us large chunks of our drive that generated positive engineering external spillovers. So why is it worse that the right has no plan today? Doesn’t no-plan beat bad-plan?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Noah Smith</strong>: <em>What is the Right’s Economic Plan?</em>: ‘In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the conservatives who took over the country did have an economic plan (my favorite history of this, by the way, is Rick Perlstein’s <em>Reaganland</em>)… cut taxes, cut spending, cut regulation. Get the government out of the way and the private sector will prosper. This program, promulgated in stump speeches and direct mail campaigns and the Wall Street Journal and even on PBS, helped Republicans’ electoral fortunes, giving voters a vision in which to invest their hopes for a more prosperous future. But even more importantly, it also gave direction to economic policy for three decades…. Ultimately, of course, excessive financial deregulation produced an epic crash in 2008. Tax cuts failed to pay for themselves and ballooned the deficit, and by the early 2000s they were clearly failing to have any noticeable effect on business investment or growth. Lack of a robust welfare state means inequality is much higher in the U.S. than in most other rich countries. Many would now argue that the U.S.’ lack of a real industrial policy allowed China to drain away much of our manufacturing base in the 2000s…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:52518798,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/what-is-the-rights-economic-plan&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:35345,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Noahpinion&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/04281755-2cd6-42e5-a496-e69153abebb2_281x281.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;What is the Right's economic plan?&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;It sounds almost crazy to hear it now, but back in 2014 or so, some friends were telling me that the Democrats were out of economic policy ideas.

Mounk argues, rightly, not only that a strong state is essential for a diverse democracy, but also that “it is individuals, not the groups to which they belong, who are the fundamental building blocks of society.” Groups have no comparable legitimacy: the lines they seek to draw around individuals are arbitrary, far from exclusive, and frequently oppressive.
