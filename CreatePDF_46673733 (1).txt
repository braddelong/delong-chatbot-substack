First: Why Isna€™t There an Inflation Non-Panic?


I read:

Mohamed El-Erian: The Key to 2022 Will Be How Inflation Is Brought Down'. a€~For more than a 
decade, large-scale central bank purchases of assets boosted not just those being bought in markets 
but also virtually all other assets, be they financial or physical (such as housing, art and other 
collectibles). This was particularly the case in 202la€!. As the new year
unfolds, both the Fed and markets have a huge stake in inflation coming down in an orderly way. But 
the window of opportunity for policy to achieve this is rapidly closing. The alternative is a 
disorderly drop, which would involve the even bigger Fed policy error of having to be too abrupt in 
tightening monetary policy after being way too slow previouslya€!

And:

Robert Armstrong: How to Panic About Inflation'. a€~High levels of panic will be appropriate if we 
see sharp acceleration in services prices, especially outside healthcare and transports^!. This 
would indicate that the strong wage gains we have seen recently are spreading pervasively though 
the economy, in ways that could (in theory) scare everyone into thinking
inflation is here to say, and trigger the dreaded wage-price spirala€!. If the Fed gets to its 
target two per cent rate in 2023a€”that still means negative short-term ratesa€!. a€oeThat is not 
going to constrain the cost of financing anythinga€Da€!. The Fed might have to get much more 
hawkish than it is now, with heavy consequences for markets. Unhedged is not there yet,
because wea€™re just not convinced demand will be strong for long, and the bond market supports our 
doubts. But Michelea€™ s argument frightens us all the samea€!

LINK: <https://www.ft.com/content/04892blb-d977-473d-8b54-d34e33a29703>

And my immediate first response is to ask the question: In what sense is the Fed supposed to have 
been "way too slow" in tightening monetary policy? We still are way short of full employment. Some 
of that is due to childcare and virus-fear bottlenecks. But some of it isna€™ t. And to the extent 
that there are important jobs not being done because people cana€™ t afford to make alternative
childcare arrangements or fear the virusa€”well, the inflation that comes from paying people more 
to see if they will take those jobs is to be welcomed, not fought:

Plus the economy has undergone a great wheel: 6% less relative to trend in personal consumption 
expenditures on services, and 20% more relative to trend in personal consumption expenditures on 
goods. Not all of that is going to stick into the post-plague economy, but a good deal of it will. 
We have an economy in which nominal wages and some nominal prices are really sticky downward.
That means that if market prices are to do their job signals of where the value is, prices and 
wages in industries that need to expand must rise relative to prices and wages in industries that 
need the contract. With prices and wages in industries that need to contract sticky downward, that 
means: inflation:

Confirmed case numbers are bullshit, save that there are going to be a lot more of them than there 
were last winter. But this seems to indicate that, here in the U.S. at least, if you get it bad 
enough to get recorded in the system, your odds of dying are not materially lower than if last 
winter you got it bad enough to get recorded in the system.

The Overshoot

Are America's "Excess" Savings Here to Stay?

The pandemic led to an unprecedented collapse in consumer spending, an unprecedented surge in 
business borrowing to cover lost revenues, and an unprecedented flood of government spending and 
loan guarantees across much of the world. The net effect was that household savings ballooned, with 
holdings of physical currency, bank deposits, money-market fund shares, and similar instruments
soaring by trillions of dollars in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and the other rich countries. Relative 
to what would have been expected based on pre-pandemic trends, American households havea€!
