He makes lots of good points:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Rafael R. Guthmann</strong>: <em>Beware the GDP</em>: ‘The 1937 German worker could rent 181% as many rooms as an American worker today, buy 99% as many potatoes, 42% as much bread, 47% as much “natural” cheese, and 26% as much beef. Compare these figures to the 13.5% per capita GDP “measured” in the Maddison dataset. Note also that the relative prices between rent and beef are different by a factor of eight. This is so thanks to technological change: US real estate became expensive over time as other goods became relatively cheaper, which means that estimated variation in GDP changes a lot depending on the method used to estimate it. </p><p>We measure nutritional standards using height data. In the US today, the average adult male height is 175.3 cm, in India average adult male heights are 10 cm shorter, at 165 cm. However, Indian men from the upper classes are 174.4 cm tall, and less than 1 cm shorter than Americans, which suggests the difference is not genetic but nutritional. For comparison, German 17–18 year old schoolkids were reaching 175 cm just before WW2…. The Maddison dataset claims the GDP per capita of Greece two thousand years ago was about 1,300 dollars, which is about 1/5 of the level of GDP per capita of India and about 1/4 of Pakistan or Nigeria today. However, skeletons from Hellenistic Greece suggest an average height of 172 cm, which is much closer to current American heights than to heights in India (165 cm) or Pakistan (165.8 cm) today. </p><p>Also, the Maddison dataset claims incomes in Ancient Greece two thousand years ago were only 30% higher than in Iron Age Belgium (around the same time). Houses in Iron Age Belgium… houses in Greece… these houses do not appear very consistent with a [mere] 30% difference in per capita GDP…. The people living in Greco-Roman city-states had the perception that they were sophisticated civilized folk and their neighboring tribal populations were uneducated and ferocious barbarians. Perhaps, this perception was not only due to delusional ethnocentric beliefs but instead a consequence of the very concrete difference in the material sophistication of their societies? </p><p>“Economic growth began recently and everybody in the past—even Europeans less than a century ago—consisted of peasants living under minimum subsistence”—or is it just that the lack of evidence combined with the spurious application of platonic theoretical constructs such as GDP that make us think that way?…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:62548726,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rafaelrguthmann.substack.com/p/beware-the-gdp&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:757128,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Rafael’s Commentary&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Beware the GDP&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;If you log on to the “Economic Growth” page of “Our World in Data” it is easy to access estimates of GDP for over a hundred countries for the last two thousand years.

primarily on (a) its willingness to save and invest, and (b) the efficiency of its workers, which is in turn a function of (c) its level of technology—its useful ideas about manipulating nature and organizing humans—and (d) its natural resources per worker.</p></li><li><p>A society’s population growth rate depends on (a) its level of consumption of necessities that make you biologically fit to reproduce relative to (b) its sociologically-determined familial and other institutions that potentially curb the rate of reproduction.</p></li><li><p>Societies differ in the proportion of their productive resources they allocate to necessities vis-à-vis luxuries.</p></li><li><p>Technological progress before the Industrial-Revolution Age proceeded at a slow average proportional growth rate <em>h</em> measured in hundredths of a percent per year.</p></li></ol><p>Then we get:</p><ul><li><p>The right-hand side of the slide above: the society’s level of productivity per worker will head for and then tend to oscillate around a <em>Malthusian </em>level equal to (a) the society’s taste for non-necessities (which include such things as having a rapacious and greedy upper class, and liking to live in cities), times (b) its sociologically-determined subsistence level of necessities consumption (which can be raised by things like a late age of first female marriage, large-scale female infanticide, or frequent <em>chevauchées</em>), times quantitatively unimportant nuisance terms.</p></li><li><p>The left-hand side of the slide above: the society’s population density will head for and then tend to oscillate around a <em>Malthusian </em>level equal to (a) the quality and abundance of natural resources per acre, times (b) the ratio of the technology level to the “subsistence” level of necessities consumption at which the population barely replaces itself, times (c) the propensity to save and invest in everything that makes humanity more productive (from tools to liming the soil to building commercial networks), (d) a chief boost to which its the provision of a <em>pax imperia</em>, times (e) the inverse of the taste for non-necessities, all (e) raised to the power that is the extent that higher population induces resource scarcity and thus lower productivity,  times quantitatively unimportant nuisance terms.</p></li></ul><p>As the centuries and millennia pass, the Malthusian equilibrium level of population density will slowly rise as technology improves.</p><p>And as the centuries and millennia pass, the Malthusian level of typical human living standards will slowly rise even as necessities-valued production per worker does not to the extent that there is faster technological progress in making middle-class conveniences than in making true bioreproductive necessities.</p><p>But even though a society tends to go back to its Malthusian equilibrium, it does not have to be there: all kinds of shocks can knock it away.</p><p>Moreover, and more important, the Malthusian equilibrium can and does shift. There are BigTime changes across societies and over time as polity and sociology shift in:</p><ul><li><p>the subsistence level of necessities consumption</p></li><li><p>the taste for luxuries</p></li><li><p>the incentives to save and invest</p></li></ul><p>These drive big differences in how societies look and are, and big differences in how societies’ economies grow and shrink: truly dire Dark Ages like post-Roman Britain or the early-Iron Age Ægean; truly magnificent (if often cruel and astonishingly unequal) civilizational “efflorescences” as Jack Goldstone has taught us to call them. Establish a <em>pax imperia,</em> with associated protection of commerce and industry from freelance expropriation by thugs with spears through a government that controls its own functionaries and so generate lots of savings, investment, and an increased division of labor; acquire a taste for luxuries, especially living in cities and upper-class and even middle-class display of comfort; and generate sociological institutions that curb and control female fertility and female-child survival, and watch what happens. On the other side, have barbarians within the gate so that as much wealth as possible is immediately turned into silver and buried, establish a sociology of very early female first marriage, and have little taste for or indeed specialization in producing non-necessities—and your Malthusian equilibrium can shift to something of interest to archæologists, but not of interest to artists or indeed to connoisseurs of material culture.</p><p>Moreover, remember this always: the gulf between the standard of living of the upper and even the middle class (who leave the major archæological footprint) on the one hand and the peasant-craftsman-servant working class on the other, whose reproduction generates the resource scarcity that anchors the Malthusian equilibrium—that can and does vary widely and wildly as well.</p><p>That pre-Industrial Revolution Age history was “Malthusian” does not mean that nothing interesting happened, or that everything was the same.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/in-what-sense-was-the-pre-industrial?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/in-what-sense-was-the-pre-industrial?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Aimee Mann</strong>: <em>4th of July</em> &lt;<a href="https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=7cgoGd1jpNY&amp;t=45s">https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=7cgoGd1jpNY&amp;t=45s</a>&gt;: </p><div id="youtube2-7cgoGd1jpNY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;7cgoGd1jpNY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;45s&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7cgoGd1jpNY?start=45s&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay;

In the 1990s I used to hear from Republicans that Clinton was not a legitimate president first because he had only won 43% of the vote (as Ross Perot split the real and rightful Republican majority), and second that the democratic party had forfeited its right to have a place at the table when they decided to back him during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Then in the early 2010s I heard not from Republicans I talked to, but in whispers, that a Black man could not legitimately govern a white nation. Now again I hear the whispers that Biden is too old to be a legitimate president. Democracy requires a loyal opposition, or it breaks down. And there is no loyal opposition on the Republican side anymore—there is only the Trumpist Party, and the whimpering Never Trump remnant:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Lucan Way</strong>: <em>Volatile Compounds</em>: ‘A developing fear among Republicans that they won’t be able to win a presidential election democratically….
