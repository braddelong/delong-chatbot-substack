In it, DeLong claims that the "long twentieth century" was the most consequential period in human history, during which the institutions of rapid technological growth and globalization were created, setting humanity on a path towards improving life, defeating scarcity, and enabling real freedom. But... this ran into some problems. Sean and Brad talk about the power of markets, how the New Deal led to something approaching real social democracy, and why the Great Recession of 2008 and its aftermath signified the end of this momentous era.</p><h4><strong>References:</strong>&nbsp;</h4><ul><li><p><em><a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/j-bradford-delong/slouching-towards-utopia/9780465019595/">Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Twentieth Century</a></em> by J.

Accept that the market giveth, the market taketh away, and say, blessed be the name of the market. To which Karl Polanyi responds… try to impose a system in which the market rules everything, in which the only form of social power comes from your wealth, in which the only rights that are recognized are property rights, and people will explode in revolution and resistance…. People… think they have other rights and demand that those be recognized…</p><p>Schumpeterian creative destruction [means] the forces-of-production… technological hardware underneath human society… [is] radically transformed every generation…. We have to… rewrite the sociological, political, economic, organizational software… run[ning] on top of this new forces-of-production hardware…. Frantically rewrit[ing] it… caught between the Hayekian imperative that we need the market economy… [and] the Polanyian… [imperative] that people will react…. They may react well – FDR and the New Deal. They may react very badly – Benito Mussolini and fascism. But they will react…. That interplay is most of the political economy story of humanity since 1870…</p><p>Right wing classical liberalism in exile… get back to the pre-Great Depression System…. People who [see the New Deal Order as]… much too bureaucratic… prone to rent-seeking…. Much of the 1960s counterculture…. The assembly-line office culture that was necessary for the prosperity of social democracy [seen as] positively inhuman…. Steve Jobs's 1984 Super Bowl Macintosh launch commercial…. How good the market can be… at crowdsourcing… summon[ing] the ingenuity of everyone who wants to be prosperous and get rich…. Plus the idea that taxes had been too high on the rich, so they spent their time buying political influence and figuring out how to evade taxes rather than being good entrepreneurial job creators. And [the idea] that subsidies had been too great for the non-rich… people feather-bedding their way through society and not contributing…. The New Deal order was distributing a lot of good things to people as entitlements simply because they were citizens…. Social democracy produces… people who are very fearful and angry about how others are being the moochers and the takers. And… neoliberals want…  to say that success in the market is a sign of your moral virtue…</p><p>We've already had several revolutions in forms of effective communication, both for scientific and other forms of knowledge, and for political organization – in our lifetimes…. And that has powerful, powerful, powerful implications for how we organize ourselves, and the economy is very much a part of organizing ourselves…. The experience of all past generations weighs like an Alp upon the brains of the living as Karl Marx wrote in his <em>18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</em>, trying to understand how the hell it could be that someone who he regarded as as much of a clown as we regard Donald Trump wound up as Emperor of France in 1851 simply because he had a famous uncle, in large part…</p><p>Our modern media shifts us from a public sphere of compromise — one in which everyone agrees we have a pretty comfortable common home here, but the Left says we need to build an addition, and the Right says we have to fix the holes in the roof — to one in which people trolling each other on Twitter forever. Who are your enemies? Who do you identify your enemies as the first step everyone takes in gaining an audience, so that you cannot even be heard without starting out, as we cannot compromise with these people, whoever the 'these people’ are…</p><p>You have managed to get magnificent things out of all of your guests so far in all of this new series that you've started…. If we do get down to a world in which podcast hosts are no longer a mass, but instead a very small elite group, you are certain to be among them…</p><p class="button-wrapper"
