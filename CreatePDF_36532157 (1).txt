Even though she is endorsed by Ross Douthat, Angela Nagle seems to me to be a remarkably silly 
person. She a€oehoped or expecteda€! Trumpa€D would a€oeadopta€! national
economic revival policiesa€D. And now she is surprised that the hated a€oeLibsa€D are enacting such 
policies, have a€oegone much further with thema€D, and a€oethese are
good policiesa€D. In spite of huge amounts of evidence, she has not yet been able to open her eyes 
and realize that Donald Trump is a grifter who does not care about anything
other than staying out of jail and owning the media cycle. Expecting him to lead a national 
economic revival was really stupid.

Did I hint that it is surprising that someone endorsed by Ross Douthat is remarkably silly? My bad. 
That start should be: a€oeSince she is endorsed by Ross Douthat, it is no
surprise that Angela Nagle seems to me to be a remarkably silly persona€n:

Angela Nagle: How The Libs Owned Us All: a€~Their policy proposals have included major national 
infrastructure spending, including expanding the train
system, a capital gains tax increase and a withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Whether they 
fulfill these promises is another question, I know. I have to
be honest though. These are good policies. Sorry. This does leave the remaining Trump inspired 
populist right in a new and somewhat awkward position.

While they have spent the last four years talking about abandoning Reaganomics and becoming critics 
of the free market, the libs have already adopted
national economic revival policies you might have hoped or expected from Trump himself and have 
gone much further with thema€!

Paragraphs:

Wow. San Francisco Bay turns out to be a uniquely powerful global brand! We will give the Pearl 
River Bay a heavy workout, win or lose. Let the games begin!:

JDSupra: Chinaa€™ s Greater Bay Area Puts Hong Kong in the Lead as Super Connector to the World: 
a€~The country is now building a landmark
megalopolis on its southern coast with the name the a€oeGreater Bay Areaa€D (the a€ceGBAa€D)a€! 
connecting] Hong Kong with 11 surrounding
cities    in southern China including Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Macau. The GBAa€™ s super economy is 
comparable to the economy of the San Francisco

Bay Area and the projected total GDP is expected to reach US$4.6 trillion by 2030a€!. With a total 
area of approximately 56,000km2 closely connected by
highways, high speed railways and ports and a population of approximately 67 million people, the 
GBA is expected to strengthen the cooperation among
the cities within it to maximize their own existing advantages in building a large-scale and 
vibrant city clustera€!

Liz Cheney appears to have given up on being a politician. She seems to have decided thata€”since 
the future is unpredictablea€”she will do what is right, in one area at least:

Josh Marshall: Cheneya€™ s Media Blitz: a€~Cheney told Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace that 
Trump a€oecontinues to be a real dangera€D for
his continued efforts to delegitimize the election processa€!. a€oePeoplea€! [now] believe that 
they cana€™t count on our electoral process to actually
convey the will of the peoplea€!. We have to be a nation of laws. If you reject the rulings of the 
courts, if you work against the rulings of our courts, then
you really are at war with the Constitution. And he is a continuing danger to our system.a€D Cheney 
expressed her dismay over the former president
misleading the millions of people who support him. a€oeTheya€™ ve been betrayed,a€D Cheney said. 
a€oeAnd certainly as we see his continued action

to attack our democracy, his continued refusal to accept the results of the last election, you see 
that ongoing dangera€da€!

Homelessness is continuous with a number of thingsa€”with housing policy being one very important 
dimension, but not the only dimension. Whether a€oethe forces pushing you
outa€! come up on you slowlya€D or not is important only if you have, as so much of the United 
States does, a nonviable crippled social-welfare system:

Matt Yglesias: Homelessness Is About Housing: a€~Something that I took for granted in one section 
of a€oeSome Thoughts on Faculty Lounge
Politicsa€D that I realize not everyone knows or agrees with is that homelessness is fundamentally 
continuous with general housing policya€!. It
misconstrues   the problem as a a€cehomelessnessa€D problem with primary adjacencies to mental 
health, addiction services, and law enforcement. I think
ita€™   s a housing problem with primary adjacencies to questions like a€oewhy was New York Citya€™ 
s population falling even before the pandemic?
a€Ua€!. People can leave cities for all kinds of reasons, after all, but most of them would come 
down to a€oeit became a worse place to live.a€D But
what                                                                      you expect to see if 
somewhere becomes a worse place to live is that the price of living there falls thanks to low 
demand. But what we actually
observed was a strong increase in rents over the decade. Rather than New York becoming a worse 
place to live, it became a more expensive place to
livea€!. Unusually high levels of homelessness and unusually low levels of vacancy are both caused 
by the same thing a€” scarcity of dwellingsa€!. We
think of the a€oehomeless persona€D and the a€oemoved to North Carolina to be closer to family and 
also to afford more space for the kidsa€D as two
entirely different types of people. But ita€™ s a single underlying phenomenon. And who ends up in 
which category will come down to a mix of luck,

whether or not you do in fact have family in North Carolina, and whether or not the forces pushing 
you out of the high-cost area come up on you slowly so
you have time to plana€!

I believe the Fed is correct here. But time will tell:

Steve Matthews: Fed Officials Have Six Reasons to Bet Inflation Spike Will Pass: a€~Acceleration in 
U.S. price growth this year will have a€oeonly
transitory effects on underlying inflation,a€D Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said Wednesday. 
Governor Lael Brainard said the day before that officials
should  be a€oepatient though the transitory surge.a€D Powell has made the same argumenta€!. 
Measures of expected inflation suggest price gainsa€!
[after]  the next year or soa€! [will] drop back to more normal levelsa€!.. Powell saida€! a€oelt 
seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation moving
up  in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there was still 
significant slack in the labor marketa€Da€!. The sticky-price
index rose a modest 2.4% over 12 months through Aprila€!. A number of structural factors have led 
to global disinflation over the past three decadesa€!.
Outside of passing on commodities prices, most U.S. firms remain reluctant to raise prices on other 
goodsa€!. Business survey shows limited price
increases  over next 5a€‘T0 yearsa€!. a€ceBase effects will contributed! to core inflation in April 
and May,a€D Powell saida€! a€oeand theya€™ 11

It is not just that the engineers who design and the engineers and technicians who manufacture the 
Apple Silicon Ml are very good. It is that the engineers who program the internal
guts of MacOS are very good too:

Jim Salter: Applea€™ s Ml is a Fast CPUa€”but Ml Macs Feel Even Faster Due to QoS: a€~When Oakley 
noticed how frequently Mac users praised
Ml Macs for feeling incredibly fasta€’’despite performance measurements that dona€™t always back 
those feelings upa€”he took a closer look at macOS
native task schedulinga€!. The lower-priority tasksa€! [were] slower on the Ml Mac than the Intel 
Maca€!. Operations with higher QoS settingsa€!
performed more consistently on the Ml than Intel Maca€’’macOSa€™ s willingness to dump 
lower-priority tasks onto the Icestorm cores only left the
higher-performance Firestorm cores unloaded and ready to respond both rapidly and consistently when 
userlnitiated and userlnteractive tasks needed
handling.   Applea€™ s QoS strategy for the Ml Mac is an excellent example of engineering for the 
actual pain point in a workload rather than chasing
arbitrary metricsa€!. Big Sur certainly could employ the same strategy with an eight-core Intel 
processora€!. What makes the Apple Ml feel so fast
isna€™    t the fact that four of its cores are slower than the othersa€”ita€™ s the operating 
systema€™ s willingness to sacrifice maximum throughput in
favor                                                                      of lower task latency. 
Ita€™ s also worth noting that the interactivity improvements Ml Mac users are seeing rely heavily 
on tasks being scheduled
properly in the first placed!
