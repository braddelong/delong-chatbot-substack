I confess that I still do not understand why everybody is not on Team Transitory right now.

There is little sign of the incorporation of any expectational shifts into contracts looking 
forward. And the breakevens do not seem to incorporate any expectational shifts of more than minor 
magnitude either.

People saying that the Federal Reserve needs to, right now, shock the economy out of a path 
destined to stagflation seem to be applying the 1970s template far outside of its proper zone of 
application, and doing so far no sensible reason that I can see. Wait, preserve optionality, and 
confirm that your future actions will be data-dependent seems far and
away the best course:

Paul Krugman: The Inflation Suspense Goes On: a€~If there was any information content in todaya€™ s 
release ,a€ I extreme scenarios in both directions became a bit less likelya€l. The headline number 
is highly likely to come down over the next few months, if only because the big run-up of oil 
prices from their pandemic
lows seems to have gone into reversea€!. Underlying inflation appears to be running high by recent 
standards, maybe around 4 percent instead of the 2 percent that is the Feda€™ s targeta€l. 
Production is constrained both by bottlenecks and by the withdrawal of several million Americans 
from the labor forcea€l. How long
will elevated inflation last? The secret answer (dona€™ t tell anyone) is that we dona€™ t knowa€!. 
The most likely scenario is a minor-league version of the 1946a€“48 inflation spikea€l. I still 
dona€™ t see any evidence that 1970s-type stagflation, in which everyone kept raising prices 
because they expected everyone else to
keep raising prices, is emerging. But todaya€™ s numbers neither reinforced nor challenged my 
beliefsa€l

Let's get real: the American Rescue Plan was the best economic policy in forty years

Ita€™ s time to set the record straight. The recovery is moving fast, and the American Rescue Plan 
is integral to that fact. Inflation hawks will tell you the Rescue Plan was a massive failure, 
citing only higher inflation. They are wrong, and we cannot allow them to write the Covid history 
book. Yes, inflationa€™ s been higher and for longer than
expected bya€!

Our public health agencies should follow the science

Today my kida€™ s elementary school is hosting a pop-up vaccination clinic for 5 to 11-year-olds to 
get their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, exactly three weeks after a pop-up clinic for first 
shots. Ita€™ s organized that way because of the CDC-recommended dosing schedule which, in turn, is 
in line with the Emergency Use Authorization the FDA
granted the kiddie vaccine, which followed an EUA and eventual standard licensure for adultsa€!

Paragraphs:

Steve Randy Waldman: Republican Primaries'. a€~I agree with Shora€™ s view that Democratic Party 
activists, particularly on social issues, constitute a weird, vanguardist community that often 
fails by placing its own concerns and unpopular remedies before serving the actual preferences of 
the demos. But public opinion polling is a bad toola€! as
likely to mislead as to help. Our political parties require sociological change. They cannot remain 
platoons of ideologues supported by plutocratic philanthropy, joined at the hip to canny lobbyists 
and dealmakers, and serve the public well. There is no technocratic quick fix to that. The parties 
have to change. Democrats are no worse than Republicans in
this regard, but that wona€™ t save thema€!. From 2023 on, for the forseeable future, Democrats 
will have little means of exercising political power at the national level. Of course Democrats 
should be careful not to let that be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Human affairs are unpredictable 
and pessimism can be hubris as much as optimism. But the
possibility that the United States will be governed by Republicans or else entirely gridlocked for 
the next decade seems like one we should be thinking about and taking seriouslya€!

Zachary Bleemer & Aashish Mehta: College Major Restrictions & Student Stratification: 
a€~Underrepresented minority (URM) college students have been steadily earning degrees in 
relatively less-lucrative fields of study since the mida€“ 1990s. A decomposition reveals that this 
widening gap is principally explained by rising stratification at public
research universities, many of which increasingly enforce GPA restriction policies that prohibit 
students with poor introductory grades from declaring popular majors. We investigate these GPA 
restrictions by constructing a novel 50-year dataset covering four public research universitiesa€™ 
student tran- scripts and employing a staggered difference-in­
difference design around the implementation of 29 restrictions. Restricted majorsa€™ average URM 
enrollment share falls by 20 percent, which matches observational patterns and can be explained by 
URM studentsa€™ poorer average pre- college academic preparation. Using first-term course 
enrollments to identify students who intend to earn
restricted majors, we find that major restrictions disproportionately lead URM students from their 
intended major toward less-lucrative fields, driving within-institution ethnic stratification and 
likely exacerbating labor market disparitiesa€!

Lina M. Khan: The Separation Of Platforms And Commerce: a€~A handful of digital platforms mediate a 
growing share of online commerce and communications. By structuring access to markets, these firms 
function as gatekeepers for billions of dollars in economic activity. One feature dominant digital 
platforms share is that they have inte grated
across business lines such that they both operate a platform and market their own goods and 
services on it. This structure places domi nant platforms in direct competition with some of the 
businesses that de pend on them, creating a conflict of interest that platforms can exploit to 
further entrench their dominance, thwart competition, and stifle
innovationa€!

Peter J. Boettke, Christopher J. Coyne, & Peter T. Leeson (2014): Earw(h)ig: I Cana€™ t Hear You 
Because Your Ideas Are Old’. a€~We contend that the market for ideas, while no doubt competitive in 
terms of scientific rivalry, is not free of distortions in the incentives and signals that guide 
economic scientists. As a result, ideas that are flawed

can come to dominate the profession, while useful ideas are left on the proverbial sidewalk of 
intellectual affairs. The smooth evolution of economic thought from falsehood to truth that 
underlies the Whig perspective is complicated by both historical circumstances and the intimate 
relationship between economics and politics that follows from the
attraction of public policy for those who enter the disciplined!
