First: The Persistent Structures of Antiliberal Thought


I often say that Frank Fukuyama's big mistake in his a€oeThe End of History a€D 
<https://www.istor.org/stable/24027184> was believing that fascism had died at the hands of the Red 
Army in the rubble of Berlin in 1945. Yet at the same time Frank was writing, Isaiah Berlin was 
undertaking one of his expeditions into the intellectual milieu of Saint Petersburg in the 1800s, 
and finding there what we now recognize as what we now see revived as Trumpism:

Isaiah Berlin (1990): Joseph de Maistre & the Origins of Fascism: a€~This isa€! a genuine 
convictiona€! that men can only be saved by being hemmed in by the terror of authoritya€!. Their 
appointed masters must do the duty laid upon them by their maker (who has made nature a 
hierarchical order) by the ruthless imposition of the rulesa€”not sparing themselvesa€”and equally 
ruthless extermination of the enemy. And who is the
enemy? All those who throw dust in the eyes of the people or seek to subvert the appointed order. 
Maistre calls them a€cela secte.a€O They are the disturbers and subverters. To the Protestants and 
Jansenists he now adds deists and atheists, Freemasons and scientists, democrats, Jacobins, 
liberals, utilitarians, anticlericals, egalitarians, perfectibilians, materialists, idealists, 
lawyers, journalists, secular reformers, and intellectuals of every
breed; all those who appeal to abstract principles, who put faith in individual reason or the 
individual conscience; believers in individual liberty or the rational organization of society, 
reformers and revolutionaries^!. This is a catalog of which we have since heard a good deal. It 
assembles for the first time, and with precision, the list of the enemies of the great 
counterrevolutionary movement that culminated in fascisma€!

LINK: <https://www.nvbooks.com/articles/199Q/Q9/27/ioseph-de-maistre-and-the-origins-of-fascism/>

The lesson that personal authority is necessarya€”that, as Karl Polanyi wrote at the end of The 
Great Transformation^’’fascists believe that individual freedom must be surrendered to obedience to 
the will of the leader if humans are to live successfully in societya€”is, indeed, the basic 
fascist lesson. People must, in Polanyia€™ s words, a€oeresign [themselves] to relinquishing 
freedom and glorif[y the] power which is the reality of societya€D, just as a single
stick that claims to be free is soon broken, while if it loses its freedom in a stick-bundle tied 
with leather thongs it becomes a mighty force in the hand of its wielder. Mussolini took this to be 
the lesson from the power he saw in ethno-nationalism during World War I.

But there are other liberal and anti-liberal currents.

Lenin suffered from the infantile mental disorder.of believing that upon the removal of the market 
the oppressive state would also wither away, and all would be very simple and easy, for "accounting 
and control necessary... have been simplified by capitalists to the utmost and reduced to the 
extraordinarily simple operationsa€’’which any literate person can performa€”of supervising and 
recording, knowledge of the four rules of arithmetic, and issuing
appropriate receipts."

What a maroon!!


Keynes thought the problem could be finessed with an extremely light-handed amount of central 
planning: full-employment policy, and the euthanization of the rentier class by the low-interest 
rates need to implement full-employment policy, would do enough of the job to make the economic 
problem cease being a bigger deal than the problem of the continued survival of Disco.
Polanyi himself called for a kind of a€cesocialisma€D. But what kind? He wrote: a€oeacceptance of 
the reality of society gives man indomitable courage and strength.... As long as he is true to the 
task of creating more abundant freedom for all, he need not fear that either power or planning will 
turn against him and destroy the freedom he is building by their instrumentality..."
That peroration may have satisfied Polanyi, but I have no idea what it means.

MEASUREMENT WITHOUT THEORY1

TJALLING C. KOOPMANS


THE EMPIRICAL APPROACH

HEN Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kep­
ler engaged in the systematic labor of

measuring the positions of the planets, and
charting their orbits, they started with con­
ceptions and models of the planetary system
which later proved incorrect in some aspects,
irrelevant in others. Tycho always, and Kep­
ler initially, believed in uniform circular mo­
tion as the natural basic principle underlying
the course of celestial bodies. Tycho’s main
contribution was a systematic accumulation of
careful  measurements.  Kepler’s  outstanding

various choices as to what to “look for,” what
economic phenomena to observe, and what
measures to define and compute, are made with
a minimum of assistance from theoretical con­
ceptions or hypotheses regarding the nature of
the economic processes by which die variables
studied are generated.

In fact, Burns and Mitchell are more con­
sistently empiricist than Kepler was. The lat­
ter made no secret of his predilection for the
principle of circular motion until observations
spoke decisively for the elliptical orbit. He
held other speculative views as to the role of


success was due to a willingness to strike out
for new models and hypotheses if such were
needed to account for the observations ob-

Pedro Schwartz: In Praise of Neo-liberalism: a€~Pigoua€™ s case against free markets was they were 
inefficient due to an endless number of external effects. Ronald Coase effectively turned the 
tables on Pigou with two arguments: that people and firms in the market often corrected 
externalities by mutual agreement, and that solutions imposed by government were more often a worse 
outcome than the starting situation. In the famous 1959 dinner at the home
of Aaron Directora€! Coase overturned a majority of twenty against his theorem at the beginning of 
the dinner. What is important for the neo-liberal position is that Coase did not take it for

DRAFT Review of R. Glenn Hubbard: The Wall and the Bridge

The real sea-change came in 1870, with the coming of what Simon Kusnetz <https://w w 
w.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1971 /kuznets/lecture/> labeled: Modern Economic Growth. 
Since then, humanitya€™ s global deployed-and-diffused technological capabilities have roughly 
doubled every 35 years or so, revolutionizing the economy each and every generation, and then 
re-revolutionizing it again in the next generation. Technological progress, the
market economy, and modern capitalism brought extraordinarily efficient new ways of making old and 
new things. But if your life was centered around making old things in the old way? Well, it was for 
good reason that Joseph Schumpeter called modern capitalism a€oethe perennial gale of creative 
destruction^□ <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.262276>. And the technological forces 
driving the a€oedestructiona€oe part were amplified because in

a market society the only rights that it recognizes are property rights, and only some property 
rights turn out to be valuable. People believe they ought to have many more and very different 
rights than those conferred by ownership of valuable property. People are not happy to be told that 
they should say: a€oethe market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the 
market.a€D

Now comes highly intelligent and thoughtful ex-right neoliberal economist Glenn Hubbard and his 
book The Wall & the Bridge 
<https://www.amazon.eom/Wall-Bridge-Fear-Opportunitv-Disruptions/dp/0300259085/>, to reflect on 
what has happened to the American economy over his career, since he started studying economics back 
in 1977. He closes with a vision of a very important and much better road not taken:

Since September 1977a€! technological change and globalization have magnified the market value of 
my skills anda€l [other] professionals. Meanwhile, the closure of Youngstowna€™ s integrated steel 
mills did not lead to moon-shot efforts toward the preparation and reconnection of many workers and 
communitiesa€!. Imagine if bold support for community colleges and training would match the 
preparation and reconnection of the

G.I. Bill as America was encouraging global integration^I bridge ideasa€l economic participation^!, 
that generates an ever-increasing wealth of the nation.
Imagine mass flourishing.

I read this closing. I flash back not to 1977, but to 16 years later, 1993.1 am in the Roosevelt 
Room of the White House, the voice I hear is not Glenn Hubbards but instead the voice of Bob Reich 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert Reich>, Bill Clintona€™ s then-Labor Secretary. Benefits of 
technology and globalization, the risks to those who might be left behind, the urgency of action to 
build not walls, to protect industries and occupations that the creative
destruction of modern capitalism is rendering unproductive, but instead bridges, to true human 
flourishing in the 21st centurya€”all that was in there. Plus there was a Vice President, Al Gore, 
keenly interested in taking the initiative to spend federal money to create the backbone of what 
became the Internet of the 1990s 
<https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/25986/historv-us-al-gore-reallv-did-take-initiative-creating-in
ternet>, the ultimate bridge to mass
flourishing   in the 21st century.

Bob Reich was then, in a sense, the leader of the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party. In those 
days I, working at the Treasury, was in the Bob Rubin winga€”the left-neoliberal winga€”of the 
Democratic Party. a€ceYesa€D, we said to Bob. a€oeYou are right. But not now. American voters are 
angry. We need to curb the deficit, raise taxes on the rich, put the budget deficit on a glide-path 
toward zero, and generate a high-investment high-productivity
growth recovery. So this year Reconciliation. Next year NAFTA. These left-neoliberal priorities 
must be our immediate priorities. Then we can turn to bridge building, and to social democracy.

It might be that if you could look Bob Reicha€™ s bare back you might you might scars from the 
treads of our vehicles as we rolled over him in the Clinton administration policy debates. The 
Clinton administration turn to social democracy, bridge building, and mass human flourishing never 
happened. We could have taken that road. But Newt Gingrich led Republicans to legislative 
victories, and blocked it. Gingrich then embarked on the journey that now has
him auditioning for the role of the Pierre Laval of American politics. Gingrich was bad news then. 
And he is bad news now

We would very much have liked to have had Glenn Hubbard on our side in the political economy 
debates of the 1990s.

Thus when Glenn Hubbard writes a€oewe economists have let the public debate drift to the opposite 
extremes of building walls and a laissez-faire optimism about change and markets making everything 
OKa€D, my immediate reaction is that of Tonto to the Lone Ranger in the old joke: a€oewhat is this 
a€~wea€™ , kemosabe?'a€oe When he talks about how a€oeT[rade ]A[djustment Assistance] came up as a 
policy topic only when new trade expansions were
soughta€”it received little sustained attention or interest in its augmentation [otherwise]a€D, he 
is talking about the Republican Party debate he participated in, rather than the one I have 
participated in.

But a€oeGlenn, you are late to the party !a€D is not a review but rather a self-indulgent whine. 
The big question is: What refreshments does he bring? The answer is that he brings a lot, and that 
they are tasty indeed.

I really wish that I had had this book in my hands six months ago, before my forthcoming Slouching 
Towards Utopia: The Economic History of the Long 20th Century, 1870-2010 <https://bit.lv/3pP3Krk> 
was set in type. I can count at least five pages that I would have been able to completely rewrite 
for the better had I had Glenna€™ s book at my fingertips as I undertook final revisions. Indeed, 
the intellectual landmarks he principally references are the same as
mine: Polanyi, von Hayek, Keynes.

I think Glenn has it right. Populists build walls. But what we need are bridges:

The antidote or counterargument to a wall is a bridge. Bridges prepare individuals for, and 
reconnect them to, participation in a dynamic economy. In an economic sense, they are required for 
mass flourishing. Politically and socially, we need bridges in order to regain public support for 
the economic systema€!. Economics offers the blueprints for bridges to prepare individuals for the 
market system, reconnect them to it, and build support
for it.
