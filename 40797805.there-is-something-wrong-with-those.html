A frustrating essay…. A useful one in the way that it illustrates the problems with popular arguments about the meaning of wokeness. The piece is built around extensive conversations with the victims of the woke mob…. Appelbaum plays with a few different historical analogies in the piece, including a number drawn from totalitarian states… but the one which frames the essay is that of Hester Prynne, the central figure of&nbsp;<em>The Scarlet Letter</em>. The woke are The New Puritans…. The essay stuck in my craw… an unfortunate lack of perspective. The fact that there is a much more virulent and imminent threat to a liberal America has been noted. The woke mob did not besiege the capital building in an attempt to lynch lawmakers and overturn an election, it isn’t threatening political violence day in and day out or working systematically to undermine American democracy, it doesn’t have the full support of the leaders of one of the nation’s two parties, and so on. That doesn’t mean that one can’t still complain… but perhaps it is possible to do so without using, say, the tagline quoted above…. My jaw fell open when I read the closing paragraph: “Worse, if we drive all of the difficult people, the demanding people, and the eccentric people away from the creative professions where they used to thrive, we will become a flatter, duller, less interesting society, a place where manuscripts sit in drawers for fear of arbitrary judgments. The arts, the humanities, and the media will become stiff, predictable, and mediocre. Democratic principles like the rule of law, the right to self-defense, the right to a just trial—even the right to be forgiven—will wither. There will be nothing to do but sit back and wait for the Hawthornes of the future to expose us…” The right to self-defense? The right to a just trial?… Wokeness… exploded… when white people finally began to pay serious attention to the fact that cops were killing black people with impunity…. People in power actually being racist is, historically, a pretty significant cause of flatness and dullness and manuscripts in drawers…. To imply that there hasn’t until now been an oppressive, illiberal culture denying opportunities for expression or justice to “difficult” people, such that the net effect of the recent push for social justice is, thanks to its occasional excesses, a stultifying one seems to me to massively mischaracterize what’s been happening…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK:</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:40767537,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://ryanavent.substack.com/p/mobs-and-justice&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:19756,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Bellows&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mobs and justice&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;“A growing illiberalism, fueled by social media, is trampling democratic discourse,” reads the homepage tagline on a new essay in the Atlantic, by Anne Appelbaum. “The result is a chilling atmosphere in which mob justice has replaced due process and forgiveness is impossible.” The piece, you may be surprised to learn, is about the woke mobs which occas…&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2021-09-01T14:40:33.380Z&quot;,&quot;like_count&quot;:6,&quot;comment_count&quot;:2,&quot;bylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:11852,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Ryan Avent&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/75430dc3-55a2-4440-b92a-663f6144336a_370x440.jpeg&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Writer, Northern Virginia&quot;,&quot;profile_set_up_at&quot;:&quot;2021-07-12T23:30:29.088Z&quot;,&quot;tos_accepted_at&quot;:&quot;2019-10-22T17:56:03.158Z&quot;,&quot;publicationUsers&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:242980,&quot;user_id&quot;:11852,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;admin&quot;,&quot;public&quot;:true,&quot;is_primary&quot;:false,&quot;publication&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:19756,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;The Bellows&quot;,&quot;subdomain&quot;:&quot;ryanavent&quot;,&quot;custom_domain&quot;:null,&quot;custom_domain_optional&quot;:false,&quot;hero_text&quot;:&quot;Exhalations&quot;,&quot;logo_url&quot;:null,&quot;author_id&quot;:11852,&quot;theme_var_background_pop&quot;:&quot;#E8B500&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2019-10-22T18:13:57.114Z&quot;,&quot;rss_website_url&quot;:null,&quot;email_from_name&quot;:null,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Ryan Avent&quot;,&quot;founding_plan_name&quot;:&quot;Founding Member&quot;,&quot;community_enabled&quot;:true,&quot;invite_only&quot;:false}}],&quot;is_guest&quot;:false}],&quot;utm_campaign&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;type&quot;:null}"><a class="embedded-post" native="true" href="https://ryanavent.substack.com/p/mobs-and-justice?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web"><div class="embedded-post-header"><span></span><span class="embedded-post-publication-name">The Bellows</span></div><div class="embedded-post-title-wrapper"><div class="embedded-post-title">Mobs and justice</div></div><div class="embedded-post-body">“A growing illiberalism, fueled by social media, is trampling democratic discourse,” reads the homepage tagline on a new essay in the Atlantic, by Anne Appelbaum. “The result is a chilling atmosphere in which mob justice has replaced due process and forgiveness is impossible.” The piece, you may be surprised to learn, is about the woke mobs which occas…</div><div class="embedded-post-cta-wrapper"><span class="embedded-post-cta">Read more</span></div><div class="embedded-post-meta">a year ago · 6 likes · 2 comments · Ryan Avent</div></a></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/there-is-something-wrong-with-those?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/there-is-something-wrong-with-those?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Gary Gorton</strong>: <em>Recent Changes &amp;

But it was dealt a body blow by the 2008 financial crisis, when “good” government, led by the US Federal Reserve, rescued financial markets from self-destruction caused by the deregulation promoted by free-market advocates. Another blow has come with the pandemic…. Trump’s major achievement was using government to create the conditions for rapid vaccine development; his major failure was not going further and undermining efforts by state and local governments to control the pandemic.

Haass is president of the Council on Foreign Relations and thus as emblematic a representative of the American national security establishment as one could want. On Friday, he commented about the ongoing turmoil in Afghanistan, “The alternative to withdrawal from Afghanistan was not ‘endless occupation’ but open-ended presence. Occupation is imposed, presence invited. Unless you think we are occupying Japan, Germany, &amp; South Korea. And yes, withdrawal was the problem.”… In advancing this consensus, ghouls who should have been discredited for their advocacy have been dug up and given prominent platforms: not just John Bolton and Paul Wolfowitz but even that ultimate undying security state vampire, Henry Kissinger. The basic argument goes something like this: Until Joe Biden came along, Afghanistan was a manageable problem. It was on path to becoming a Japan, Germany or South Korea, a country that would have a permanent American military presence under stable conditions with little or no loss of military life…. This establishment myth… is clearly designed to scapegoat Joe Biden for problems that are not caused by the withdrawal but are in fact inherent in bipartisan policy going back two decades in four administrations. To gauge how fantastical the establishment party line is, it is worth reading “The Afghanistan Papers,” a blockbuster Washington Post report by journalist Craig Whitlock that ran in 2019 (which will soon be available in expanded form as a book set to be released next week). Unfortunately, “The Afghanistan Papers” were largely ignored by the rest of the media and by the political elite. Yet it stands as the best and most clear-cut account of the failed American war….
