A Non-Socratic Dialogue:

Milton Friedmana€™s Influence Kept Right-Wing Economists from Reverting to Full Crazed 
Liquidationist Nutjobs for 60 Years. But Why Did It Then Decline So Fast in the Decade of the 
2000s?

Claudia Sahm: "We should have a recession,a€d John H. Cochrane said in November [2008], speaking to 
students and investors. a€oePeople who spend their lives pounding nails in Nevada need something 
else to do.a€D #yikes <https://t.co/vbSKhIRMtR> by @delong

Scott Gosnell: I was there. I may even have a recording down in the archives and may have sprained 
my eyes I rolled them so hard.

Brad DeLong: What! Really? Tell me morea€!

I mean, private housing construction as a share of GDP had crashed from its peak of 5.0% of GDP in 
2005Q4 through its historical average of 3.4% in 2007Q2, and had bottomed all the way down to 2.1% 
by 2008Q4, when Cochrane was opining about too many people pounding nails in Nevada:

Paragraphs:

Jiwon Choi, Ilyana Kuziemko, Ebonya Washington, & Gavin Wright: Local Economic and Political 
Effects of Trade Deals: Evidence from NAFT: a€~Counties whose 1990 employment depended on 
industries vulnerable to Mexican import competition via the 1994 North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) suffer large employment losses (relative to the bottom quartile of counties, 
counties in the top quartile of NAFTA exposure see 5a€“8 log-point
declines in employ- ment by 2000). Despite large employment losses, we can reject even modest 
population declines. Trade-adjustment-aid relief rises, but covers a tiny share of the job losses 
we document, and Disability Insurance in fact displays a much larger response. Exposed counties 
(many in the upper South) begin the period more Democratic in terms of votes in House elections, 
but as NAFTA is debated in 1992a€‘T994 they shift in the Republican
direction and by 2000 vote majority-Republican in House elections. We show with a variety of 
microdata, including 1992a€‘T994 respondent-level panel data, that opposition to free trade 
predicts shifts towards Republican party identification^!

Matthew Yglesias: Seventeen Points on Israel & Palestine : a€~As Joe Biden says, America is an 
ideaa€!. not an ethnostatea€!. The worst moments in our history trace specifically to the politics 
of ethnic exclusiona€!. This is the greatest country on eartha€!. The best country Jewish people 
have ever had in historya€!. The current iteration of the Zionist project appeals mostly to 
believers in ethnic nationalism. Ethnic nationalism is, as they say, Bad For The
Jewsa€!. I am a Jewish American who likes his cosmopolitan liberalism, thank you very much. I find 
it incredibly regrettable that hard nationalism is on the rise globally, and think that it is 
leading to pain and misery that will only get worse if it continues to gain steama€!. The 
Israel-Palestine situation has its own unique features, but it is also part of a fairly general 
trend toward hardening sovereignty claims and deploying nationalism to mask official
corruption^!

Beijing when ita€™ s in Americaa€™ s interests to do so,a€D but days later noted the likelihood of 
a€oeextreme competition^□ with Chinaa€!. [Moreover,] Republicans are certain to criticize the 
administration for being weak and ineffective in the face of international challengesa€!. This is 
unfortunate. For all the concepta€™ s influence in recent years,
great-power competition is not a coherent framework for U.S. foreign policya€!. Rivalries between 
leading states exist in every international systema€!. With Washingtona€™ s unipolar status now on 
the wane, powers such as China and Russia find it easier than they once did to challenge U.S. 
leadership^!. It is one thing, though, for Washington to observe increasing competition among great 
powers and adjust to a world in which it enjoys less influence than
it   once did. It is another entirely to elevate competition itself to the guiding paradigm of U.S. 
foreign policya€”as the Trump administration proposed and Biden may wind up doinga€!. When adopted 
as a foundational paradigm of foreign relations, great-power competition relegates collaboration to 
an afterthought or, worse, dismisses it as naivea€!
