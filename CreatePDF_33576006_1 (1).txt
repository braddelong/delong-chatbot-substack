Introduction:

Most of us spend more than one-third of our waking lives working for large, modern corporations: 
organizations where we do not know personally either those at the top or the bulk of those at the 
bottom of the organization's administrative hierarchy. This is a striking change from two centuries 
ago, when a productive organization of more than thirty was unusual, and one of more than three 
hundred an extreme oddity.

Why do so many of us work for large modern corporations? And what impact does working for large 
modern corporations have on our lives? The second is much too broad a question, and is moreover a 
question that I—a narrow-minded professional economist—feel unqualified to address. So I am going 
to focus on the economic side of the modern corporation. I am not going discuss the political or 
sociological or ethical implications of large modern corporations.
I am not going to discuss their historical development, or the contrasts between different 
countries' styles of corporate life.

I am going to focus on the issues of corporate control. A corporation is a hierarchical 
organization. It has a boss—today the he (almost always a he) called the CEO, whose theoretical 
power is autocratic throughout the scope of the corporation, and subject only to the periodic 
continued approval of the Board of Directors and the annual meeting of the shareholders. But we 
were all told, back when the Soviet Union collapsed, that hierarchical organizations simply
did not work as modes of organizing economic lifea€”that you needed a market in order to achieve 
anything better than low-productivity, bureaucracy-ridden economic stagnation.

What, then, are all these large corporationsa€”ATT and IBM, General Motors and Toyota, Microsoft 
and USXa€”doing? What methods of corporate control have saved them from turning into smaller 
versions of the unproductive Soviet economy?

That our economy is populated by large corporations shapes how we live. Our social being cannot but 
be shaped by the one-third of our waking lives spent at work. Our politics would be very different 
without corporations both as sources of pressure an influence on politicians and as intermediaries 
serving the purposes of politicians. It should not be surprising that the continued existence and, 
indeed, economic dominance of large corporations is due to a number
of different forces. Very, very few things in this world have a single cause. The corporation 
flourishes because it is useful to (and thus favored by) the government, because we have a set of 
institutions to govern corporations that greatly limit the power of the forces that destroyed the 
Soviet planned economy, because our technology requires increasingly fine coordination of different 
aspects of the production process, and because our corporations are embedded in
a market economy that imposes a substantial amount of competitive pressure on corporations. Even 
small lapses relative to its competitors in a corporation's efficiency as a productive organization 
can destroy the corporation as a profit-making organization—and corporations that are not 
profit-making organizations do not survive, but as long as there are other competing corporations 
their failure gives their competitors space to grow.

The balance among these four factors is next to impossible to assess. But all are strong and 
growing stronger. The past two centuries have seen the growth of the modern corporation from next 
to nothing to its present size and strength. There are no signs that the next century will see the 
modern corporation as an institution shrink.

A Market Economy?

Our economy is a market economy: on that everyone agrees. What economists call the "price 
mechanism" controls the allocation of labor, the production of goods and services, and the 
distribution of commodities. Wherever demand is higher lower than supply for some particular 
product prices fall, and some of those making or supplying it head off for other lines of business; 
whenever supply is higher lower than demand prices rise, and new producers and
sellers enter the market. To have a market economy is by and large a good thing: the price 
mechanism acts as a gigantic social calculating machine to organize our economy and to direct the 
division of labor and the allocation of production: an invisible hand, as it were (Smith, 1776; P. 
423).

It is a commonplace that any society that aspires to be even a half-good society must allocate 
labor to different branches of industry and organize production through the market system: there is 
no other realistic option. The collapse of the Soviet Union was the result not of its moral or 
political failures (although those were great) but of its economic failures: the inability of its 
Communist Party-run centrally-planned and heavily-industrialized economy to deliver
even the standard of living of Mexico or Malaysia. Levels of labor productivity east of the Iron 
Curtain were less than a quarter and probably only a tenth those of similarly-situated neighboring 
countries lucky enough to avoid Communist rule. Thus Communism's collapse has brought about 
near-universal agreement that the central planning-oriented alternative to the market economy was 
simply unworkable (for anything other than mobilization for a relatively
short war) (Ericson, 1991).

If history is—as Marx and Engels (1848) believed—about struggles over systems of economic 
arrangements, then we have indeed reached at least a temporary end of history (Fukuyama, 1992).

But do we really live in a market economy? When we look at the pattern of economic transactions in 
our modern market economy, the striking thing is how large a proportion of transactions do not pass 
through anything like a market. In any given year more than three out of every four workers do not 
go on the labor market: they keep working for the same organization that they had worked for the 
prevous year, doing much the same thing, at much the same
wage. When they do change jobs, they are at least as likely to change jobs within the same 
organization as to get bid away by another offering them a higher wage (or fired by the first as 
not worth their pay). Within the production side of the economy, the overwhelming proportion of 
movements of goods and the provision of services takes place within a single corporation: one 
branch or division providing something of value to another branch or division, with
no money changing hands. Microsoft's application developers do not sell their products to its 
marketing division. Different branches do not bid for and buy the daily services of the 
corporation's top managers. Within each of the corporations in our economy there exists not the 
spontaneous division of labor produced in an unplanned fashion by the invisible hand of the market, 
but a planned and organized division of labor.

To get an idea of the size of the segments of economic activity not planned and coordinated by the 
market system but guided and directed by the managerial hierarchies of modern

corporations, consider General Motors. General Motors is still the largest American industrial 
corporation. It has 710,000 employees. It has total annual sales of some $169 billion: more than 
one half of one percent of the total world's economic product. The recorded net value of its plant 
and equipment is some $220 billion. And its total profits in a good year (like this on) exceed $7 
billion a year. Only nineteen nations in the world today have an gross domestic
product larger than GM's total sales. Considered as an economic unit, the piece of the world's 
economy strucured and coordinated by General Motors is roughly one-third the size of Canada.

General Motors is one of the biggest of a large extended family of mammoth modern corporations. Go 
down Fortune magazine's "Global 500" list. The last U.S .-headquartered corporation on the list is 
ITT Industriesa€’’formerly International Telephone and Telegraph. It is perhaps one-twentieth the 
size of General Motors. But its annual sales are some $9 billion, and it employs some 30,000 
people. The total annual sales of the world's 500 largest corporations
are some $11.4 trillion—compared to roughly $8 trillion for the annual Gross Domestic Product of 
the United States.

There is a sense in which these large modern corporations do indeed live in the market economy: the 
prices at which they buy materials and sell goods are to a large degree those that balance supply 
against demand. They are set to match the marginal resource cost of the last unit of any commodity 
produced to the utilitarian benefit to its consumer. And when large corporations negotiate with one 
another, the terms and conditions they agree on are reached in the
context of the threat to break off negotiations and buy what is needed on the open market if the 
trading partner does not provide a good enough deal. The transactions by which a corporation buys 
materials and supplies from and sells products to the outside world are "market" transactions 
(Williamson, 1981). But there is a strong sense in which we do not live completely in this market 
economy. As consumers we do. But as producers and employees, many of us
live in an economy that is better thought of as a corporate economy: an economy in which patterns 
of economic activity are organized by the hands of bosses and managers, rather than a one in which 
the pattern of activity emerges unplanned by any other than the market's invisible hand.

It has long been obvious that management and the planned divisions of labor within the enterprise 
for it to manage play an important role in what are called market economies. We can see management 
at work even in Adam Smith's (1776) Wealth of Nations, which has for more than two centuries 
provided intellectual foundations for the market economy. Adam Smith begins his book by extolling 
the benefits of a finely-divided and highly-productive division of
labor. And the example of a high-productivity division of labor that Adam Smith gives is of a 
pin-making factory, in which:

one man draws out the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth 
grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct 
operations; to put it on, is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade 
by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this 
manner, divided into about eighteen distinct occupations...

And one boss hires the workers, sets them their tasks, designs the workflow, and watches over all. 
The productivity benefits of the division of labor are there, but they are there because the owner 
of the pin factory planned them. In Adam Smith's day it was a large enterprise that employed more 
than 200 people. Today General Motors employs 700,000. The past two centuries have seen a more than 
thousand-fold multiplication of the power of what Alfred
Chandler (1977) called The Visible Hand of corporate management as the planner, director, and 
organizer of the pieces of the economy.

Productive Efficiency

It is natural to look at the fall of the Soviet economy alongside the continuing flourishing of 
mammoth corporations and to be puzzled. Just what is going on here?. General Motors' total sales 
amount to forty percent of Russia's total national product: roughly all of the civilian economy in 
the 1980s. Didn't the fall of Communism prove that central planning simply does not work as a way 
of organizing economic activity? Yet isn't the internal division of labor
within General Motors (or Adam Smith's pin factory) a planned division of labor? Doesn't the 
internal economic organization of General Motors look a lot like the internal economic organization 
of the Soviet Union? So how does General Motors survive and make $7 billion in annual profits? How 
can the organization of large pieces of the economy through management be a success when their 
organization through planning is such a failure? So how is it that our
modern, large corporations are efficient production and distribution organizations? What mechanisms 
keep them from the fate of ever-rising bureaucracy, ever-increasing inefficiency, and technological 
stagnation that overcame the Soviet Union?

This is the problem of corporate control.

People have proposed four answers: they have appealed to industrial evolution; to economies of 
coordination; to the success of the mechanisms of corporate governance; and to the government's 
desire to support the modern corporation as an intermediary that it can use for its own purposes.

Industrial Evolution

Sixty years ago Ronald Coase (1960) gave an answer to those who wondered how it could be that our 
economy with its large corporations was still relatively efficient at organizing production: he 
appealed to economic evolutiona€”that through evolutionary processes the market economy would 
generate efficient productive organizations, and so the large corporations that had been produced 
by the market economy were efficient.

Suppose a firm was too small to be an efficient producer in its line of business. Then, Coase 
argued, it would go out of business: either it would be so inefficient as to keep losing money, and 
so go bankrupt, or sooner or later some financier would scent the profits to be earned by merging 
it into a larger firm that could realize the economies of efficient scale (see Alchian and Demsetz, 
1972). Suppose, on the other hand, that a firm was too large to be an efficient
producer in its line of business. It would tend to shrink: its low profits (or losses) would make 
it difficult for it to find funds to keep its capital from depreciating. Some financier might scent 
the profits to be earned by breaking it up into smaller, more nimble competitive pieces.

Thus, Coase argued, a market economy that (like ours) contains large corporations must contain 
efficient large corporations: otherwise they would have been eliminated by the market's competitive 
forces long ago.

From one perspective this is dangerously close to a tautology, like the mythical biologist who 
claimed that the population of a species grew because of its evolutionary fitness, and that the 
thing that proved that the species was evolutionarily fit was that its population grew. Coase 
essentially tells us that those large corporations that have survived in our economy have largely 
escaped the process of bureaucratization and ossification that doomed the Soviet
economy. But we knew that already: we wanted to know why. From a second perspective, however, the 
evolutionary argument does give a piece of the answer.

In the Soviet Union nothing bad happened to an inefficient industry, or an unproductive factory. 
Perhaps there were episodes of blame-pointing, plans for reform, and turnover of selected managers, 
but the organization's deficit would be covered by the central government and people would continue 
to go to work. By contrast, in our economy very bad things threaten to happen to large 
corporations. In the automobile industry both Chrysler and General Motors
approached the edge of destruction in the late 1970s and early 1980s, respectively. Apple Computer 
is now unlikely to survive its current crisis. One in ten of Fortune's 500 largest non-financial 
corporations lost money last year: after they had sold their products, there was not enough for 
them to pay their suppliers and workers, and so they had to dip into their capital.

The discipline that market competition exercises over corporation actions appears to be fierce and 
severe from inside all but the luckiest corporations. Every manager is aware that a series of 
lapses that has only a small damaging impact on a corporation considered as a productive 
organization will nevertheless have a large damaging impact on the corporation considered as a 
profit making organization. Shareholders and financiers have little patience with
businesses that do not make profits: better to take their resources and turn them over to a 
corporation and a managerial organization that can make a profit. So corporations that are unable 
to make profits do not survive. They rarely go through formal bankruptcy and liquidation, but they 
often go through informal bankruptcy and partial liquidation. They are almost always swallowed up 
by other corporations, with much of their productive resources shut down and
abandoned and the rest added onto a different organization.

In any set of organizations, some will be good and some will be lousy. In the Soviet economy 
getting rid of a lousy productive organization was a very big deal, requiring a mammoth political 
fight and the making of many enemies for the future, so there was little tendency for the sun to 
set on factories and industries that were not doing well. This is the core of truth in the 
"industrial evolution" argument: a properly functioning market economy enforces "sunset"
on unproductive corporations. Moreover, the threat that five unprofitable years mean the 
disappearance of the corporation raises the goal of increasing productivity to a priority much 
higher than in the Soviet Union.

Economies of Coordination


A second answer to tne question ot wnat Keeps modern American corporations under control—wnat Keeps 
tnem trom succumbing to tne deatn spiral ot bureaucratization and metnciency seen in tne tormer 
soviet union—is to appeal to economies ot scale and ot coordination, mere are times and places in 
wnicn tne marKet is a better social calculating mecnamsm tor directing tne division ot labor tnan a 
bureaucratic nierarcny; and mere are times and places wnen a

planned division of labor is better. Our corporate economy allows large hierarchical organizations 
to fill those niches in which planning is appropriate, and is thus preferable to alternatives that 
either leave no role for the market or no role for large organizations.

Economists believe that a a centrally-planned and administratively-allocated organization of 
production is likely to be most efficient when the costs of failing to produce the exact right 
amount of a commodity are high (Weitzman, 1974). If you have made twenty-two V-8 engines, you had 
better have ordered twenty steering wheels from your supplier. If when you go to the market you 
find that you can buy only twenty steering wheels, your production of the
twenty-first and twenty-second V-8 engines was a waste of effort. Thus the large corporation has 
its place wherever the waste from failing to exactly coordinate the quantities produced is 
relatively large. It may not be necessary to have such exact coordination.

In much of the economy substitutes for a good are common, alternatives are available, and 
efficiency is best pursued by trying to match the value of the last unit of the product produced to 
its cost in terms of resources. But whenever the cost of producing one too few is large, and the 
value of the one too many that is produced is zero, then administrative coordination of production 
is very valuable indeed.

Corporate Governance

The third answer is that modern corporations are efficient because they are by and large 
well-governed: the mechanisms that are supposed to keep corporations focused on reducing costs and 
improving quality so as to make profits by and large work. These mechanisms of corporate governance 
are a peculiar combination of formal, legal duties and processes with less formal modes of 
operation in the financial markets. The Legal Structure Begin with the law. In
law, the Chief Executive Officera€”the CEO—of a corporation is not its boss. The CEO is, himself 
(and in large corporations it is almost always a himself), simply another somewhat special employee 
of a corporation. In law the real corporation is made up of the stockholders: they are the "body," 
the "corpus." They have assembled, committed their money to entering this joint business together 
(or bought stock from those who committed their money to this joint
business), and hired employees to conduct the details of the business while the shareholders attend 
to the reast of their affairs. Once a year at the corporation's annual meeting its members—the 
shareholders—gather (or send in their proxies). They review the progress of the business. They 
periodically choose through election (one share-one vote) the principal employees to manage the 
business: the CEO andafew more. They also choose a Boardof Directors to
meet periodically to watch over how the business is conducted, to consult with and review the 
decisions of the CEO, and to exercise some of the shareholders' collective powers of ownership 
until the next annual meeting.

Subject to the power of the stockholders and the Board of Directors to remove him, the CEO of a 
corporation has extremely broad discretion. The corporation has suppliers, workers, executives and 
customers. It has informal agreements with them about how business will be conducted. It has 
contracts with them, which are the corporation's formal promises of what it is going to do and how 
it is going to do it. If the corporation breaks its contracts, it will have to
settle with the aggrieved party on pain of being dragged through the courts. But the CEO is the 
boss. He can break the corporation's contractual obligations when he feels it appropriate. And 
where explicit contracts do not tie his hands, the short-run power of the CEO is nearly absolute. 
Workers and managers are employed at will: except as restrained by labor-management agreements, the 
CEO and those to whom he delegates his power can fire workers on whim,
for no reason at all. Except as guaranteed by explicit contract, the claims of suppliers who have 
dealt with the corporation for decades are only as strong as the CEO wishes. Long-time customers 
have no right to the continued availability of the goods they are accustomed to buy if the CEO 
thinks things should be otherwise.

Thus the legal structure of a modern corporation grants the CEO (and those to whom he delegates 
managerial authority) extraordinary autocratic power. This power is confined to the economic 
sphere: they decide who has a job with the corporation and who does not, and what the corporation 
makes and what it does not. But within the economic sphere modern tools of administration and 
communicationmake their power lookstronger than thatof the most
absolute monarchs.

This power is checked and governed by the fact that the CEO is, ultimately, simply another employee 
of the corporation. The owners are the shareholders (usually working through their representatives, 
the members of the Board of Directors), who exercise their control through one-share one-vote 
majority-rule democracy.

Theory and Practice

However, there is in this case a larger than usual gap between the legal theory and actual business 
practice (see Allen, 1992). First, it is next to impossible for shareholders to spontaneously rise 
up at the annual meeting as one and to dismiss the CEO. A typical company will have at least as 
many shareholders as employees once you take account of the ultimate ownership interests of those 
who have their money in mutual or pension funds that own shares of the
corporation. This diversity of ownership helps to limit risk: widespread diversification is the way 
to make investment portfolios safer, and thus better for the investor. But such widespread 
diversification makes collective action by shareholders through the legal mechanisms of 
"shareholder democracy" very difficult. Exercise of shareholders' formal powers of ownership 
through votes at the annual meeting is overwhelmingly difficult because very few of the
shareholders have a significant stake at risk in any one particular corporation. It is hard to 
become an informed voter: it takes a lot of time and thought to sift and evaluate alternative 
proposals for the future direction of the corporation. Few of us are satisfied with the turnout and 
the level of engagement of America's voters in political elections. And in politics all of the 
emotional resonance of patriotism is deployed on the side of becoming an informed voter,
going to the polls, and casting one's ballot. Things are infinitely worse in corporate elections, 
where voting is not a duty of a good citizen and where information about the costs and benefits of 
alternative leaders and courses of action is difficult to assemble.

So when you look at turnout in corporate elections, it is low. Most of those who bother to vote 
have simply sent in their proxies authorizing whatever course of action was proposed by the CEO. 
Thus many of the members of Boards of Directors are in practice be candidates proposed by the 
CEO—people who know that they owe him a favor for getting them this particular well-paid part-time 
job. Organizing a shareholder democracy campaign—a proxy fighta€”
against the existing management is expensive and unlikely to succeed.

Adolph Berle and Gardiner Means (1932) pointed out nearly two-thirds of a century ago that 
shareholder democracy simply did not work: that political democracy is a so-so mechanism for 
exercising political control, and that corporate shareholder democracy worked considerably less 
well because of the absence of the emotional force of patriotism. Their Modern Corporation and 
Private Property argued that the top managers of modern corporations had
become "entrenched": they made up a self-reproducing oligarchy that could choose its own 
successors, could not be dislodged from control, and administer the corporation in their own 
interest—not in the interest of shareholder profitability or economic efficiency.

In the past generation it has become more and more clear that Berle and Means overstated their 
case. They were correct in claiming that shareholder democracy did not work in practice as the 
formal legal doctrines envisioned. But they were wrong in claiming that the self-reproducing 
oligarchy of top managers had become so entrenched as to have effectively turned the corporation 
into their own property. So what are the—alternative—mechanisms that control
corporations' CEOs practice? The first and most important such mechanism is peer pressure. It is 
not much fun to be CEO of a money-losing corporation. A higher salary or more perquisites of office 
does not repair the psychic injury: there is a point beyond which a higher salary is valued not 
because of the things it can buy but because it announces that you are a winner, but no one thinks 
that the highly-paid CEO of a money-losing corporation is a winner.

Because success in the games CEOs play with and among themselves is defined by a large positive 
bottom line, they would continue to chase economic efficiency and cost reduction even if they were 
a completely insulated self-reproducing oligarchy.

Voting-with-the-Feet and Corporate Takeovers

The second such mechanism is that shareholder democracy has a small amount of life in it. Although 
it is next to impossible to organize tens of thousands of small shareholders into a majority 
coalition to unseat the existing managers, it is very possible for one—very large—shareholder who 
owns a majority of shares to use the folmal procedures of corporate governance to replace the 
managers. When will such a single majorityshareholderappear?When the price
of the stock is cheap enough to make the profits from such a corporate takeover worth the risk. 
Thus the votes of individual shareholders matter, but the votes that matter are not ballots cast 
for an annual meeting but instead the votes-with-the-feet made when shareholders exit the 
corporation: when they lose confidence, sell their shares, and push down the corporation's stock 
price (see Hirschman, 1970).

Thus when individual shareholders lose confidence in a corporation's management, they sell their 
shares. And at some point the price drops low enough that a group of financiers who think they can 
do a better job buy up shares, and offer to buy up more until the achieve a majority and take 
control of the corporation. This market for corporate control works, and works well enough to 
terrify the managers of America'scorporations. Todayyouarc more likely to
hear—especially from CEO's who seek discretion to invest in long-term projects that they claim 
would be good for the corporation as an on-going entity—that our system forces top managers to pay 
more managerial attention than is healthy to shareholder views and desires.

It is still not completely clear what the wave of corporate takeovers that America has seen in the 
past two decades actually did to the economy. (I) Some argue that it was largely a device for 
merging competitors with one another, and that the profits earned through the takeover boom were 
either the benefits of realizing growing economies of scale or achieving greater monopoly power 
(see Bhagat, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1990). (II) Others see it as little more than a
wave of financial manipulation to (successfully) reduce corporations' income tax bills (see Blair, 
1995). (Ill) Still others see the takeover boom's replacement of one group of managers by another 
as a way to break a corporation's implicit and explicit promises on salary levels and operating 
procedures to its workers and suppliers (see Shleifer and Summers, 1989). (IV) And others see the 
wave of takeovers and threatened takeovers as a genuine improvement in

the way in which the market system disciplines executives who take their eyes off of the bottom 
line (see Jensen, 1989).

The most judicious (and probably the most correct) view is that of Steven Kaplan and Jeremy Stein 
(1993), who see (IV) as the most important element in the takeover battles of the early 1980s, and 
increasing elements of the other threea€”along with simple speculative excess caused by Wall 
Street's herd mentality leading it into deals that did not make financial sense—as the decade of 
the 1980s drew to its close. Fifteen years ago it was fashionable to hold up
the Japanese corporation as an example, to say that its managers regarded shareholders as only one 
stakeholder interest among many, and to say that the Japanese corporation was a superior 
organization and the wave of the future. Now it is fashionable to praise the American form of 
organization, with an active market for corporate control and with strong pressure on managers to 
do whatever they can to boost stock prices now.

If there is anything certain, it is that fifteen years hence some other organizational twist on the 
corporate form will be fashionable in its place, and discussion will focus around the flaws of 
existing American (as well as Japanese) institutions of practical corporate governance. But in the 
meanwhile it is important to recognize that CEOsa€”for all their near-autocratic power to fire 
workers by the tens of thousands, close lines of business, and shift the strategic
direction of their corporations—see themselves as tightly constrained, and with surprisingly little 
freedom to act otherwise. What looks to us like near-absolute and near-untramelled power looks to 
them like tight discipline enforced not just from the market for corporate controla€”the takeover 
game—but from other markets as well.

For most workers in most years (and for nearly all customers, and for most suppliers), there is 
another corporation that they could work for, buy from, or sell to located just down the street. 
Labor unions are weaker now than they have been at any time in the past sixty years. Nevertheless a 
modern

corporation must treat its workers at least as well as their perceived alternative employment, or 
they will walk. A company that is contracting has some but limited power to demand that its 
employees accept lower wages and harder working conditions. A company that is expanding must pay 
prevailing market or above market wages, or it simply will not expand. Moreover the fact that a CEO 
can command does not mean that other employees will obey.
Instructions can be given, but they need to be obeyed enthusiastically by others for them to mean 
anything.

CEOs have tools to win the enthusiasm of their subordinates: the rhetoric of shared accomplishment 
of action and vision; the carrots of promotions, salary increases, and bonuses; the sticks of 
demotion and dismissal. But even with these tools, managing a large bureaucratic organization is a 
difficult task. And changing its direction away from that of mere business-as-usual requires great 
skill and luck.

The Government and the Corporation

Still a fourth reason for the flourishing of the modern corporation is that the government finds 
the large corporation very valuable. Thus all kinds of benefitsa€”from the limited exposure to 
liability of those who commit their equity capital to the corporation, to the fact that 
corporations that pay their employees in the coin of social insurance benefits do so tax-free, to 
the fact that corporations realize economies of scale in dealing with the government and its
paperwork (whether the IRS or the MA)—give the modern large corporation a government-sponsored 
competitive edge. The corporation in America is valuable to the government because it can be called 
upon to do more than its own private purely economic tasks. From the perspective of the modern 
government, the corporation is the government's principal tax collector. The corporation collects 
the government's income and sales taxes for it. Withholding for
income taxes and point-of-sale collection for sales taxes make the paying of taxes largely 
automatic. The government would have an infinitely more difficult time collecting anything if it 
had to deal with each individual for his or her entire tax bill either for income or for sales 
taxes.

Indeed, there is no one that the Internal Revenue Service fears more than the independent 
contractor: the person who does not work for a corporation, and with whom the government must deal 
directly in order to collect taxes. So the IRS tries as hard as it can to force independent 
contractors into being someone's employees. It desperately wants collecting, withholding, and 
monitoring compliance with the tax law can be their employers' job—and not the IRS's.

The corporation provides an increasingly large share of social insurance benefitsa€’’largely at the 
government's behest. Large majorities of Americans and their politicians believe—at least after the 
end of political advertising campaigns—that American citizens ought to have social insurance 
services and benefits: health insurance, dental insurance, pension benefits, and so forth. But 
large majorities of Americans and politicians also fear—at least after the end of
political advertising campaigns—big government: for most politicians, proposing to socialize 
medicine or proposing large increases in social security taxes is a quick ticket out of one's 
office in the Capitol or the White House and into a better-paying but much lower-status job, 
arguing that oil companies are overtaxed or that Bengalis are selling an unhealthily large amount 
of textiles to U.S. customers.

So how can politicians and voters both have big government-like social insurance programs without 
having big government? By inducing or ordering corporations to provide them. Pensions? The 
government promises to reduce the total taxes paid by corporations and by workers by roughly 
thirty-three cents for every dollar that corporations and workers shift out of current wages and 
into invested funds to provide post-retirement benefits. Health? The
government offers the same deal: if corporations and workers will shift two dollars out of current 
wages and into purchasing health insurance for the workers' families, the government will 
contribute a third dollar by reducing the total taxes paid. It is no surprise that corporations 
have responded. Even the paperwork they must fill out to deal with the government is not a heavy 
burden for a large corporation, for the paperwork is highly repetitious.

So more than eight out of ten of those with health insurance who are not covered by the 
government's Medicare and Medicaid programs receive their insurance through their employers.

Conclusion

In the past century and a half large corporations—business organizations in which those at the top 
do not personally know those at the bottom of the hierarchy at all—have grown from exceptional 
oddities into extremely visible and widespread economic institutions. How have corporations managed 
to grow and survive in view of the obvious economic inefficiencies of bureaucratic and hierarchical 
organizations^’’inefficiencies of which we are now very
conscious because of the fall of the Soviet Union? People have proposed four answers: they grow 
because those that are inefficient died and disappeared; they grow because the increasing 
complexity of technology has created more and more places where the benefits of planned 
coordination outweigh the inflexibilities of bureaucratic hierarchy; they grow because over the 
past century and a half we have hit on modes of corporate organization that are actually
quite good at providing pressures for cost reduction and efficient production; and they grow 
because the government needs them—could not function without using them as intermediaries^’’and so 
rewards large corporations and punishes other forms of organization in subtle ways.

All four of these are surelv somewhat correct.

1995). (Ill) Still others see the takeover boom's replacement ot one group oi managers by another

wave ot takeovers and threatened takeovers as a genuine improvement in

the way in which the market system disciplines executives who take their eyes off of the bottom 
line (see Jensen, 1989).

The most judicious (and probably the most correct) view is that of Steven Kaplan and Jeremy Stein 
(1993), who see (IV) as the most important element in the takeover battles of the early 1980s, and 
increasing elements of the other threea€”along with simple speculative excess caused by Wall 
Street's herd mentality leading it into deals that did not make financial sense—as the decade of 
the 1980s drew to its close. Fifteen years ago it was fashionable to hold up
the Japanese corporation as an example, to say that its managers regarded shareholders as only one 
stakeholder interest among many, and to say that the Japanese corporation was a superior 
organization and the wave of the future. Now it is fashionable to praise the American form of 
organization, with an active market for corporate control and with strong pressure on managers to 
do whatever they can to boost stock prices now.

If there is anything certain, it is that fifteen years hence some other organizational twist on the 
corporate form will be fashionable in its place, and discussion will focus around the flaws of 
existing American (as well as Japanese) institutions of practical corporate governance. But in the 
meanwhile it is important to recognize that CEOsa€”for all their near-autocratic power to fire 
workers by the tens of thousands, close lines of business, and shift the strategic
direction of their corporations—see themselves as tightly constrained, and with surprisingly little 
freedom to act otherwise. What looks to us like near-absolute and near-untramelled power looks to 
them like tight discipline enforced not just from the market for corporate controla€”the takeover 
game—but from other markets as well.

For most workers in most years (and for nearly all customers, and for most suppliers), there is 
another corporation that they could work for, buy from, or sell to located just down the street. 
Labor unions are weaker now than they have been at any time in the past sixty years. Nevertheless a 
modern

corporation must treat its workers at least as well as their perceived alternative employment, or 
they will walk. A company that is contracting has some but limited power to demand that its 
employees accept lower wages and harder working conditions. A company that is expanding must pay 
prevailing market or above market wages, or it simply will not expand. Moreover the fact that a CEO 
can command does not mean that other employees will obey.
Instructions can be given, but they need to be obeyed enthusiastically by others for them to mean 
anything.

CEOs have tools to win the enthusiasm of their subordinates: the rhetoric of shared accomplishment 
of action and vision; the carrots of promotions, salary increases, and bonuses; the sticks of 
demotion and dismissal. But even with these tools, managing a large bureaucratic organization is a 
difficult task. And changing its direction away from that of mere business-as-usual requires great 
skill and luck.

The Government and the Corporation

Still a fourth reason for the flourishing of the modern corporation is that the government finds 
the large corporation very valuable. Thus all kinds of benefitsa€”from the limited exposure to 
liability of those who commit their equity capital to the corporation, to the fact that 
corporations that pay their employees in the coin of social insurance benefits do so tax-free, to 
the fact that corporations realize economies of scale in dealing with the government and its
paperwork (whether the IRS or the MA)—give the modern large corporation a government-sponsored 
competitive edge. The corporation in America is valuable to the government because it can be called 
upon to do more than its own private purely economic tasks. From the perspective of the modern 
government, the corporation is the government's principal tax collector. The corporation collects 
the government's income and sales taxes for it. Withholding for
income taxes and point-of-sale collection for sales taxes make the paying of taxes largely 
automatic. The government would have an infinitely more difficult time collecting anything if it 
had to deal with each individual for his or her entire tax bill either for income or for sales 
taxes.

Indeed, there is no one that the Internal Revenue Service fears more than the independent 
contractor: the person who does not work for a corporation, and with whom the government must deal 
directly in order to collect taxes. So the IRS tries as hard as it can to force independent 
contractors into being someone's employees. It desperately wants collecting, withholding, and 
monitoring compliance with the tax law can be their employers' job—and not the IRS's.

The corporation provides an increasingly large share of social insurance benefitsa€’’largely at the 
government's behest. Large majorities of Americans and their politicians believe—at least after the 
end of political advertising campaigns—that American citizens ought to have social insurance 
services and benefits: health insurance, dental insurance, pension benefits, and so forth. But 
large majorities of Americans and politicians also fear—at least after the end of
political advertising campaigns—big government: for most politicians, proposing to socialize 
medicine or proposing large increases in social security taxes is a quick ticket out of one's 
office in the Capitol or the White House and into a better-paying but much lower-status job, 
arguing that oil companies are overtaxed or that Bengalis are selling an unhealthily large amount 
of textiles to U.S. customers.

So how can politicians and voters both have big government-like social insurance programs without 
having big government? By inducing or ordering corporations to provide them. Pensions? The 
government promises to reduce the total taxes paid by corporations and by workers by roughly 
thirty-three cents for every dollar that corporations and workers shift out of current wages and 
into invested funds to provide post-retirement benefits. Health? The
government offers the same deal: if corporations and workers will shift two dollars out of current 
wages and into purchasing health insurance for the workers' families, the government will 
contribute a third dollar by reducing the total taxes paid. It is no surprise that corporations 
have responded. Even the paperwork they must fill out to deal with the government is not a heavy 
burden for a large corporation, for the paperwork is highly repetitious.

So more than eight out of ten of those with health insurance who are not covered by the 
government's Medicare and Medicaid programs receive their insurance through their employers.

Thus our modern social insurance state is to a large degree a corporate social insurance state: the 
corporation is the intermediary that delivers the benefits that the government believes citizens 
ought to have to its employees. Such a corporate social insurance state does not work very well. 
What good is employer-sponsored health insurance if you have no employer? What if your employer is 
a small corporation, and does not take the bait the government has set
because the tax subsidy the government offers insufficient to cover the administrative burden of 
becoming the government's local social insurance agent?

Conclusion

In the past century and a half large corporations—business organizations in which those at the top 
do not personally know those at the bottom of the hierarchy at all—have grown from exceptional 
oddities into extremely visible and widespread economic institutions. How have corporations managed 
to grow and survive in view of the obvious economic inefficiencies of bureaucratic and hierarchical

because the government needs them—could not function without using them as intermediaries^’’and so 
rewards large corporations and punishes other forms of organization in subtle ways.

All four of these are surely somewhat correct.

Deciding how important each is is next to impossible. We cannot rerun history with different forms 
of financial and legal organization to see how much of the growth in corporations is the result of 
improved forms of organization, or with different technologies that provide different economies of 
coordination. We can, however, note that all of the pressures continue to be on the side of an 
expanded role for the large corporation. The social insurance state will
continue to need the corporation as an intermediary. The evolution of financial and commodity 
markets is in the direction of increased market discipline and international competition. 
Technologies grow more sophisticated and complex. Individual corporations will grow and shrink. The 
very, very largest may turn out to have positive or negative synergies and increase or decrease 
their own shares. But the modern corporation will be here for a long time to come.
And the presence of the modern corporation will affect how we live along many dimensions, for the 
corporation is not just a private economic entity. Consider the corporation as collector of taxes 
and dispenser of benefits.

It is hard to imagine our modern government without the corporation as its agent. Before the rise 
of the corporation governments would strain their tax-collecting capacities to the breaking point 
to lay their hands on even fifteen percent of national income through excise taxes, real estate 
taxes, window taxes, luxury taxes, and trade taxes. Today industrial country governments collect up 
to three times as much without producing clear and visible reductions in rates
of economic growth. Or consider the corporation as a sociological entity: a place where you see 
your friends, engage in your status games, and first learn and then express your culture: what it 
is that your kind of people like to do. Your workplace is more than a third of your waking life. To 
lose or to change one's job is an event of much more importance than deciding to go to a different 
grocery store because you like its loss leaders.

Economists want to treat the two as the same: a change of where you sell your labor analogous to a 
change of where you buy your groceries. Sociologists point out that when you change your grocery 
store you do not change a large part of your circle of friends (and enemies) as well. But they have 
done little more than note a potentially unhealthy tension between an employment relationship that 
on the individual's side becomes invested with a large share of the
individual's identity and that on the corporation's side remains a matter of the bottom line.

The modern corporation has drifted far indeed from its origins, when it was a way for the king to 
create a collective identity for merchants and their townsa€”those who were neither lord, knight, 
peasant, priest, or monk—so that they could be fitted into the feudal system.
