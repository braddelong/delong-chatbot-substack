I am Brad DeLong, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a sometime 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. This is the weekly DeLongToday briefing. Here I 
hold forth here on the Leigh Bureaua€™ s vimeo platform on my guesses as to what I think you most 
need to know about what our economy is doing to us right now.
I promised Wes Neff when he agreed to provide the infrastructure for this that I and my briefings 
would be: lively, interesting, curious, thoughtful, and relatively brief.

Relatively.

I promised I would provide briefings on a mix of: forecasting, politics, macroeconomic analysis, 
history, and political economy.
Today is mostly an economic analysis situation briefinga€!

                                  Recorded: 2020-01-21

But first:

I want to note that I am extraordinarily pleased by the result of last Wednesdaya€™ s inauguration 
of President Joe Biden. It had much more of an effect on me than I had thought it would have. It 
was, for me, a real the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwelt in 
the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shineda€\

To all those of you who were among the helpers here, thank you very much.
And for those who were not, please consider three questions:

1. How did you turn into such an easily-grifted moron?

2. Why didna€™t you wake up and smell the coffee at any of the obvious moments?

3. How are you going to change your ways so that you are less of a menace to us in the future?
And I am 75% confident that we barely dodged a very dangerous bullet.

When Attorney General Barr quit, and when Trump replaced the top echelon at the Defense Department, 
and when past Secretaries of Defense including Richard Cheney wrote a letter stating that the 
military had no interventionist role to play in the transfer of power, people I respect said: Trump 
is going to try somethinga€\

It looks to me like a 75% chance that they were right: he did try somethinga€\

My view is that it is more likely than not that people in the defense and justice departments were 
told to slow-walk any requests for back up coming from a riot at the Capitol. And the mob was 
tolda€”in a semi-plausibly-deniable way, of course; thata€™ s how Trump operatesa€”to try to storm 
the Capitol and put some spine into Mike Pence and the Republican senators by threatening to lynch 
them.
But then they stormed the Capitol.


And they waited for instructions from Trump for what they should do next.
And those instructions did not come.

And then Pence told the Defense Department to stop the slow-walking.

And there were only 7 senators who were scared or thought it would be to their political advantage 
to try to overturn the election.

And there were only 120 House membersa€”40 scared, 40 hoping it would be to their political 
advantage, 40 easily-grifted morons who believeda€’’willing to try to overturn the election.

Now for the main coursea€!

I am here to talk about prospects for medium-term economic growtha€’’although my medium-term may 
seem like the long run to you. For I am going to do so by looking way back as well as sideways at 
the current developments in technology.
Let me start from where we are.

The world today has something like 7.6 billion people on it. The world today has an average level 
of national income of around $12 thousand per person per year. Part of the globe is much richer 
than $12 thousand per person per year: the top 10th that is the global north has an average income 
of national income of about $50,000 per year. Part of the globe is much poorer: the bottom 
billiona€”the bottom l/8tha€”has an average income of $1000 a year, which
supports a style of life not that significantly different from the style of life of our 
preindustrial peasant and craftworker serf ancestors. There are big differences along only a few of 
its dimensionsa€’’public health and mass communications being the major two.

Bottom Billion        World Average         Global North

There is a great deal of economic growth for humanity as a whole that is, in a sense, already 
completely baked into the cake. It is at hand and can be grasped by simply deploying and diffusing 
the technologies already deployed in the global north. Bringing the world average up to todaya€™ s 
global north average would quadruple humanitya€™ s wealth. It would open the door to the prospect 
of a truly human world. (Or it would if humanity could also be made
to undergo a psychological and sociological-organizational sea-change, for all evidence today is 
that, while poverty and material resource stringency greatly aid us in making trouble for 
ourselves, we are driven to make bad trouble for ourselves even under conditions of wealth and 
abundance.)

Would resource scarcitya€”of which the most important aspect right now appears to be the limited 
capacity of our biosphere to serve as a carbon sink without deranging our climatea€”keep us from 
accomplishing this to-hand quadrupling of human wealth? Almost surely not. Our physicists and 
technologists I have turned out to be more ingenious and creative than I would have thought at all 
likely a generation ago, The transition to non-carbon energy systems
is now held back not by humanitya€™ s poverty in any sense, but by the pure short-sighted greed of 
many of humanitya€™ s powerful, who are taking advantage of their strong positions to block action. 
This is just one of the many reasons that Americaa€™ s Republican Party needs to clean house. (It 
is not the most important such reason: the Republican Party in America needs to clean house unless 
it wants to go down in history as the keystone of the early
21st century fascist revival; but cleaning house with respect to environmental policy is a close 
second.)

How much more in economic growth can we expect from our future, in addition to this global 
quadrupling?

Since the end of World War II in 1945, the world has roared ahead, with the value of the stock of 
useful human ideas that underpins the efficiency of our labor growing at an average rate of 
2.2%/yeara€”that is doubling every 32 years. Not all of that has gone to support higher 
productivity and incomes. Those have grown at 1.6%/year, and the rest of the potential for income 
growth has gone to compensating for greater resource scarcity as humanitya€™ s
numbers have grown from 2.3 billion in 1945 to 7.6 billion today. But that needed to compensate for 
increasing relative resource scarcity is coming to an end.

Right now it looks as though the completion of the demographic transition will stabilize human 
populations at 9 billion in the middle of the 2000s. Thereafter improvements in technologies for 
manipulating nature and organizing humans will all flow through to higher incomes.
If we extrapolate the 2.2%/year 1945-2020 number for the invention and deployment of ideas, we get 
a more-than-quintupling to an average human annual income of $64 thousand in 2100: a world with an 
average a hair above that of the global north today.

A further 80 years and another more-than-quintupling would get us to $370 thousand in 2180. And if 
we look forward to the mid-millennium, extrapolating at the same pace, we see an average human 
annual income of $400 million per year in 2500. The average one of us then would have the 
income-based social power to every single dayEt, acquire goods and use services that would, in 
aggregate and on average, cost a million dollarsa€”and something like $10
million on a peak-consumption day.

Consider all of the technological and organizational change from the year -68000 to the year 1500. 
That seems, roughly, to be of the same proportional magnitude of all the technological and 
organizational change from the year 1500 to 2020. The year 2500 of our extrapolation tells us that 
we will take another such leap of the magnitude of -68000 to 1500 or of 1500 to 2020, and then a 
second such leap, and then 3/4 of a third such leap, and that will be our world
in 2500.

It is really hard for me to imagine what that might mean.

I suspect that we will not get there. That might be because my imagination fails me. But it is, 
more probably, because there is no sense in which the 2.2%/year proportional growth rate of the 
collective useful-ideas stock that humanity has seen since 1945 is in any way guaranteed. Let us 
look further back, and see what we see:
Before 1945 the ideas-stock proportional growth rate was almost as large back to 1870: 1.95%/year 
rather than 2.2% per year, taking us to a world in 1870 of 1.3 billion people with an extremely 
poor average annual human per capita income of $1.3 thousand.

But before then growth was much slowera€”something like only 0.5%/year back from 1870 to 1795, and 
then something like 0.15%/year from 1795 back to 1570, and something like 0.1% back to 1495, when a 
world of 500 million people had an average annual per capita income of the not just extreme- but 
the dire-poverty levelof $900. The paceof growth had been  gathering speed since1500 up to and 
through the Industrial Revolution era. But the biggest
upward acceleration by far was the one that took place around 1870.

And before then? As I said, as much of a proportional leap from 1500 to today as from -68000 to 
1500. Back in the year -68000, there were perhaps 100 thousand of us East African plains apes in 
our habitat of evolutionary adaptation, in ecological balance where if we were to become any poorer 
malnourishment would cause our numbers to dropand resources become more relatively abundant.And 
perhaps we had just learned toreally talk.
Between 1500 and the end of the Bronze Age in -1000, the rate of growth of our ideas stock was 
something like 0.04%/year. Between -1000 and the discovery of agriculture in -8000, something like 
0.015%/year. And before then? Perhaps 0.003%/year.

2.2%a€”0.5%a€”0.15%a€”0.04%a€”0.015%a€”0.003%. Thata€™ s too many numbers. To grab hold of them, 
think of them as modern-growth, industrial, commercial and imperial, agrarian, pre-civilization, 
and gather-hunter ages, each with its characteristic underlying economic growth rate. And think of 
each of them in terms of the time it takes the value of the human ideas stock to double: 32 years 
for the modern-growth post-1870 age, 140 years for the
1800-1870 industrial age, 500 years for the 1500-1800 commercial-imperial age, 1750 years for the 
-1000 to 1500 agrarian age, 4500 years for the -8000 to -1000 pre-civilization age, and 25000 for 
the gatherer-hunter age.

You might think that this broad pattern should make us very optimistic about the future of economic 
growth. We see, age after age, acceleration in the pace of growth. The difficulty of achieving 
technological breakthroughs because the low-hanging fruit has been harvested has been more than 
offset by the fact that there are so many more of us investigating ideas and our tools for thought 
are nowmuch much better. And thatmay well be true.
But there has been no significant acceleration in the pace of global growth since the 1870 or so 
breakthrough to the modern growth era. And there have been disquieting signs in the slowing pace of 
global north growth over the past couple of generations.

Measured in dollars of 2012a€™ s value, American real national income per capita was $31 thousand 
in 1948 and $53 thousand eighteen years later, in 1966. But 1984a€’’another 18 yearsa€”saw it at 
only $60 thousand, and that was after the first two very rapid years of growth of the Reagan 
recovery. And the last of the Reagan-Bush years, 1992, saw it at only $68 thousand. The growth rate 
thus went from 3.0 to 0.7 to1.6%/year. The run from 1992 to 2006

saw growth recover to 2.2%/year. But since 2006 it has been anemic at 1.0%/year, and that was 
before 2020a€™ s COVID-19 plague. Worldwide growth has been faster than American over the past 
twenty years as other countries have been catching-up. But economic history warns us that this 
catching up is not necessarily durable, or reliable.

And this slowdown has been called the Great Stagnation <LINK> by the intelligent and reliable Tyler 
Cowen, and by many, many others <LINK>. The past two generations are the first time when the pace 
of global productivity growth has materially slowed. Perhaps we might find analogies with the Dark 
Age at the very start of the Iron Agea€”when in a half-century it appears as though every large 
city on or near the arc of the Mediterranean coast between
Gaza and the Peloponnese was violently destroyed. Perhaps we might find analogies with the 
post-Antonine Dynasty repeated crises of and long-term decline of the Roman Empire. But we know too 
little about them for us to even claim that history rhymes here.

This age of the Great Stagnation has been marked by an extraordinary rise in wealth inequality. And 
that, in turn, triggered an extraordinary rise in demand for safe assets as the super-rich fear 
losing what they have much more than they wish to take advantage of opportunities for growth. And 
that, in turn, has triggered our cycles of high unemployment and disruptive financial speculation. 
And that, in turn, has triggered large scale belief that our government is
no longer securing the rights of the people who count. And that, in turn, has led to the otherwise 
mysterious attractiveness of neo-fascism. The slowdown in growth from a faster earlier pace has 
itself been destabilizing to generations who feel like they have been cheated.

But now it is really looking as though this Great Stagnation is over.

Exceeding the 1%/year productivity growth rate of the past would be wonderful. Is hoping we can do 
so reasonable?
I believe that it is.

I was most impressed by Caleb Whitneya€™ s piece on Cracks in the Great Stagnation <LINK>. rapid 
growth requires not just revolutionary technologies but revolutionary technologies that help in 
producing things in high demand so that they get widely deployed as well. He sees a future in 
which, perhaps:

VR/ARa€! become[s] the next consumer electronic platform with a whole suite of specialized 
productivity-enhancing features, similar toa€! computers and mobile phonesa€! future vaccinesa€! 
usinga€! mRNA technique [s]a€! specialized AI manages to find 20 to 40% improvements to basically 
every informationally complex taska€! driverless cars/trains/trucks fulfill[ing] their promise and 
reshap[ing]a€! citiesa€! geothermal or
nuclear energya€! clean energya€! abundanta€! too cheap to meter, with all the economic 
applications downstreama€!

And I have been impressed by Noah Smitha€™ s argument that our shift from 2% to 1% growth was 
mostly driven by our entering an age of energy-technology stagnation and energy-market disruption. 
As Smith quotes Bill Nordhaus <LINK>:

The productivity slowdown of the 1970s has survived three decades of scrutiny, conceptual 
refinements, and data revisions. The slowdown was primarily centered in those sectors that were 
most energy-intensive, were hardest hit by the energy shocks of the 1970s, and therefore had large 
output declines. In a sense, the energy shocks were the earthquake, and the industries with the 
largest slowdown were near the epicenter of the tectonic
shifts in the economya€!

But with the loss of the salience of oil, Middle Eastern war and politics no longer have the power 
to generate global energy-market disruptions. And our era of energy-technology stagnation is now 
over. This from Max Rosera€™ s Our World in Data <LINK>, may be the most important graph of the

And another straw in the wind is the highly reliable and intelligent Tyler Cowen: What Might an End 
to the Great Stagnation Consist of? <LINK>. He sees:

Applea€™ s Ml, GPT-3, DeepMinda€™ s application of AI to protein folding, phase III for a credible 
malaria vaccine, a CRISPR/sickle cell cure, the possibility of a universal flu vaccine, mRNA 
vaccines, ongoing solar power progress, wonderful new batteries for electric vehicles, a possibly 
new method for Chinese fusion (?), Chinese photon quantum computing, and ongoing advances in space

Note that the Apple Ml is here because it may mark a return to Moorea€™ s Law-scale improvements in

years, in a time in which Intel has barely managed 30% improvement:

And here is the kicker.

1  .0%/year growth has been the a€oeGreat Stagnationa€D of the past decades. It is the pessimistic 
scenario. Yet 1%/year growth is wonderful in the sweep of historical perspective, even if it is 
small beer compared to the 2.2%/year growth of the post-1945 era. 1.0% is twice the pace of the 
industrial age and 25 times the pace of the agrarian age. 1.0% per year growth would not carryus to 
a worldof $63thousand average annual incomes come 2100 and $400
million in 2500; but it would carry us to a world of $26 thousand average global incomes from 
2100a€”a bit more than half of todaya€™ s global north. And it would carry us to one of $145 
thousand average global incomes in 2270, a world as much proportionately richer than ours as ours 
is richer than that of our pre-industrial ancestors.

$145 thousand annual incomes are not the absurd mind-blowing singularity levels of $400 million. We 
can imagine how all of humanity would manage to usefully spend such incomes because they are the 
incomes that some of us already do manage to spend, and that all of us see, as such incomes are 
pretty much those that support the reference lifestyle of modern American TV. Such a universal 
American upper-middle-class world would look  to uslike  a
of abundance, and it would be, in the same way that the globe today would look like a society of 
abundance to a time traveler from our ancestorsa€™ pre-industrial past. And 2270,250 years from 
now, is not that far in the future. They are as far separated from us in time as we are from John 
and Abigail Smith Adams, and from Thomas and Sally Hemings Jefferson.

The future, indeed, is bright for humanitya€”if we can maintain the 1%/year average underlying rate 
of growth that seems to be our post-1970 new normal. And doing that is surely within our grasp, if 
we can organize ourselves to grasp it. And doing much better may well be very possible.
