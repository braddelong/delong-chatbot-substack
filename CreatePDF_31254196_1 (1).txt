Bernie Sanders: Why Impeach Now?

Bernie Sanders @BernieSanders

Some people ask: Why would you impeach and convict a president who has only a few days left in 
office? The answer: Precedent. It must be made clear that no president, now or in the future, can 
lead an insurrection against the U.S, government.

When Warnock and Ossoff are seated, Democrats and Republicans will each control half of the seats

Joshua Gans: B.l.1.7 <https://ioshuagans.substack.com/p/b 117>: a€~B. 1.1.7 has an advantage over 
older variants in infecting people when the mitigation strategies are in place. In other words, it 
is getting around them.  My guess is that the new variant can obtain more cases in certain 
settingsa€”like workplaces that previously were able to keep transmission lowa€”

and then people carry the new variant home where fewer mitigations are in place and transmission 
occurs more easily there.... That means that the fight against B.l .1.7 requires the places that 
have been the most vigilant need more action. It is hard to know what that is.  The other 
optiona€”and I will continue to beat this still live horse herea€”is ramping up testinga€!

Tom Snyder: The American Abyss chttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/magazine/trump-coup.html> : 
a€~When we give up on truth, we concede power to those with the wealth and charisma to create 
spectacle in its place. Without agreement about some basic facts, citizens cannot form the civil 
society that would allow them to defend themselves. If we lose the
institutions that produce facts that are pertinent to us, then we tend to wallow in attractive 
abstractions and fictions. Truth defends itself particularly poorly when there is not very much of 
it around.... Social media. supercharges the mental habits by which we seek emotional stimulation 
and comfort, which means losing the distinction between what feels true and what

actually is truea€!

BRIEFLY NOTED:

Haley Bird Wilt: The Consequences of Lying to People 
<https://uphill.thedispatch.eom/p/the-consequences-of-lving-to-people>: a€~Republican lawmakers 
misled millions of people into believing the results of a legitimate election could be overturned. 
Many of them viewed contesting the outcome as a relatively easy way to gain political currency 
among Trump
supporters, knowing all the while that their efforts would have no real impact on who will be sworn 
into office in two weeks. The deceptiona€’’primarily led by Trump, yet enabled by members of 
Congressa€”set the stage for the violence that unfolded at the Capitol Wednesday. Four people died. 
The normally dry procedural affair of counting of the Electoral College

votes was viewed by everyday Republicans and zealots alike as the place to make a final stand to 
overturn the electiona€”even though elected Republicans knew the outcome would ultimately remain 
unchanged. As my colleague Jonah writes this morning, a€oeConvincing people they need to prevent a 
coup when no such coup exists is a recipe for violence.a€D This
was the energy that fueled the horde on Wednesday a€!

Edward Luce: Americaa€™ s Dangerous Reliance on the Fed 
<https://www.ft.com/content/bcb8d4d9-ca6d-45b7-aafc-9e9ecf672a5b>: a€~Alas, the chances are that 
the Fed will remain a€oethe only game in towna€D. This would be both a missed opportunity and pose 
a severe danger. The opportunity is for the US government to borrow long term funds at near zero
rates and invest it in productive capacity. The danger of not doing that can be expressed in a 
simple equation: QE a€” F = P. Quantitative easing minus fiscal action equals populisma€!

Wikipedia: Metanarrative <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metanarrative>: a€~In The Postmodern 
Condition: A Report on Knowledge (1979), Lyotard highlights the increasing skepticism of the 
postmodern condition toward the totalizing nature of metanarratives and their reliance on some form 
of "transcendent and universal truth": a€oeSimplifying to the extreme, I
define postmodern as incredulity toward metanarratives. The narrative function is losing its 
functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal. It is being 
dispersed in clouds of narrative languagea€!. Where, after the metanarratives, can legitimacy 
reside?a€!a€D Lyotard and other poststructuralist thinkers (like Foucault) view this as a broadly

positive development^! grand theories tend to unduly dismiss the naturally existing chaos and 
disorder of the universea€!. Postmodernists attempt to replace metanarratives by focusing on 
specific local contexts as well as on the diversity of human experience. They argue for the 
existence of a "multiplicity of theoretical standpoints" rather than for grand, all-
encompassing theories.a€! Postmodern narratives will often deliberately disturb the formulaic 
expectations.a€I Others have related metanarratives to masterplots, a€oerecurrent skeletal stories, 
belonging to cultures and individuals that play a powerful role in questions of identity, values, 
and the understanding of lifea€Da€l

Simon Schama: Donald Trumpa€™ s Weaponised Lies Blew Up in His Face 
<https://www.ft.com/content/6cde0715-5506-4c09-a804-538031a667d9>: a€~The violent attempt to 
prevent Congress from certifying the electoral result should be seen in the context of Mr Trump's 
(not baseless) belief that a sizeable part of the country cares less about the constitution than it
does about him. Wednesday saw the most dramatic consummation of what has always been standard 
operational procedure for Trumpism: the wink to violence and the empire of lies. His 2016 campaign 
regularly featured invitations to rough up the mediaa€!

Salvatore Cerchio & al.: A New Blue Whale Song-Type Described for the Arabian Sea & Western Indian

3 subspeciesa€l 4 populations, each with a diagnostic song-type. Here we describe a previously 
unreported song-type that implies the probable existence of a

population that has been undetected or conflateda€L We label it the a€~Northwest Indian Oceana€™ 
song-type.a€! Moreover, the potentially restricted range, intensive historic whaling, and the fact 
that the song-type has been previously undetected, suggests a small population that is in critical 
need of status assessment and conservation actiona€!

J. A. M. de Sanchez: Stabilizing the Franc 
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/france/1928-10-01/stabilizing-frano: a€~Thus almost 
exactly twenty-three months after accepting the portfolio of Minister of Finance, M. PoincarA© 
brought to a conclusion the task of fiscal reform which he had set himself. If M. PoincarA©'s 
achievements in his first year were
remarkable,[i] those in his second have been no less so. Not only have the measures which were 
adopted in 1926-1927 continued to be strictly enforced, but new ones have been sought and applied 
which have resulted in a further strengthening of the credit structure of the State proper and of 
the national economy as a whole. So careful and complete were the preparations
for    de jure stabilization of the franc that the event itself was received in France almost 
phlegmaticallya€!
