Si,


Adina: Fic: Armistice (Jeeves & Wooster x Lord Peter Wimsey)'. a€~Jeeves was engaged in arranging 
bronze chrysanthemums in a bowl on the mantel when I emerged from the Wooster bedroom. a€oeWhat 
ho!a€D I greeted him jauntily. Such was my mood that with any bird less dignified I might have 
biffed him on the shoulder, but thata€™ s just not the sort of thing you do with Jeeves. a€oeWhat 
ho, what ho,a€D I repeated.
a€oeGood morning, sir,a€D Jeeves said, repeating the salutation with which he had greeted me an 
hour before when he brought in the sausages.

a€oeTopping morning, what?a€D I walked over to the window and might have flung open its draperies 
if Jeeves hadna€™ t opened them himself some time previous.
a€oeMost clement for November,a€D Jeeves agreed.

a€oeEspecially after all the drizzle last week. Why does it always rain for Guy Fawkes, do you 
think?a€D

Jeeves finished with the flowers and gave the bowl a keen gaze, moving it finally three hairs to 
the left. a€oeThe Americans have the same complaint about their own Independence Day, I believe. It 
has been theorized that the smoke from gunpowder has an adverse effect on the weather.a€D
a€oeTickles the clouds and make them let loose, you mean?a€D

a€oeThat is the general theory, sir,a€D Jeeves stated with perhaps a hint of doubt in his voice. 
a€oeWill you be lunching in today?a€D

a€oeMuch too top hole a day for that, dona€™ t you think? a€D I said, crossing to the mantle to 
steal one of the flowers for my buttonhole. a€oeMake hay while the sun shines, dona€™ t they say? I 
thought I would toddle down to the Drones and see whoa€™ s up for a spot of lunch.a€D

Jeevesa€™ s hand intercepted mine before I could disarrange his flowers. a€oelf I might suggest, 
sir, I believe this would be more appropriate.a€D This was a species of red vegetation that 
appeared in his hand as if by magic. It was rather larger and redder than was the Wooster wont, but 
I have never known Jeeves to err in matters sartorial. If he has a fault ita€™ s that his tastes 
tend too far to the conservative, so if he thought this red cabbage leaf unexceptional
then so it was.

a€oeRight ho,a€D I said after he had affixed the bally thing to my lapel. a€oeToodle-pip, then, 
Jeeves. If you want to totter down to the Junior Ganymede yourself feel free; I shana€™ t need 
you.a€D

a€oeVery good, sir.a€D Jeeves hesitated and looked at the clock. a€oe Would you care for a whisky 
and soda first? a€D It was my turn to look at the clock, which read ten-thirty, earlier than is my 
wont regardless of what my Aunt Agatha might say. My look must have said it all. a€oeOr perhaps 
another cup of tea?a€D he offered instead.
Jeevesa€™ s sudden impulse to provide the young master with liquid refreshment was rather rummy. 
a€oeNo need,a€C I said with the cheery wave, heading for the great outdoors.

I had scarcely quit Berkley Square when two well-known figures turned the corner towards me, Tuppy 
Glossop and his uncle, Sir Roderick.

There was a time when the sight of Sir Roderick, the noted loony doctor, would have sent me leaping 
for the high hills, he and I having failed to click after he arrived at my flat to find it occupied 
by a plethora of cats, thanks to my cousins Eustace and Claude. He had thus determined that I was 
non compos mentis and unfit to marry his daughter Honoria, but an otherwise unfortunate night 
mutually spent with our faces covered in burnt cork had sparked an
unlikely friendship. It was with a light heart then that I greeted them. a€oeWhat ho, Tuppy! Sir 
Roderick!a€D

a€oeMr. Wooster.a€D Sir Roderick was actually smiling, proving once again that he could be one of 
the lads once the ice was broken. Tuppy looked less pleased.

a€ceBertie!a€D he yelped. a€oeWhat are you doing in London? I thought you would be down at Brinkley 
Court.a€D B.C. is the residence of my good and deserving Aunt Dahlia, as sound an egg as ever 
chivvied a fox.
a€oeAunt Dahlia telephoned to say they were quarantined for the scarlet fever,a€D I explained, 
wondering at his interest in my plans.

Sir Roderick chuckled. a€oeThat sounds like the excuse I once useda€“a€D

Tuppy interrupted what looked to be an interesting reminiscence. a€oeNo, Ia€™ m sure Mrs. 
Traversa€“a€D His voice trailed off at some thought known only to himself.

a€oeHildebrand and I are off to the Bellona Club for lunch,a€D Sir Roderick inserted into what was 
threatening to become an awkward silence. a€oeWould you care to join us if you are disengaged?a€D 
Hildebrand was the name that Tuppya€™ s parents had provided the vicar at his christening, a piece 
of information that he naturally tried to keep quiet.
a€oeNot an engagement to be seen, old bean,a€D I said. a€oeLead on.a€D The Bellona Club was new to 
me, but I trusted Sir Roderick to provide a good feed.

As we walked Sir Roderick rambled on about the Bellona Club and his membership in it, but I wasna€™ 
t paying much attention, spending my time trying to figure out the concerned glances that Tuppy 
kept shooting me.
a€oea€“fought in the Boer War, though you wouldna€™ t think to look at me now,a€D Sir R. said. 
a€oeRose to captain before I took shrapnel to the left calf.a€D

a€oeEr, yes,a€D Tuppy said. He opened his mouth and then closed it again, with a sideways look at 
Mrs. Woostera€™ s bonny lad. He had the look of a man nerving himself up to bite an unclea€™ s ear, 
inhibited by the presence of an onlooker. a€oeYes, um.a€D He pasted a ghastly smile on his face. 
a€oeDid your aunt say how Angela was, Bertie?a€D he asked in a rush.
The poor sap must have been more worried about his fiancA©e than I thought. a€ceTickety-boo,a€D I 
reassured him. a€oeTickety-boo. Well, actually she didna€™ t mention Angela, but she said only one 
of the maids caught it. She was pretty incensed about the quarantine, told me to sneak in 
anyway.a€D

I may have forgotten to mention at the time that Tuppy and Sir R. were both wearing the same red 
flower with which Jeeves had garnished me, and now Ia€™ 11 be dashed if the doorman of the Bellona 
werena€™ t sporting the bally thing as well. There must have been a special offer on them, a 
conspiracy amongst the gentlemena€™ s gentlemen of London to save some dosh.

Once inside, Tuppy pulled Sir R. aside and I courteously studied one of the paintings on the wall 
to give him privacy to put the bite on. It had been years since I had had to depend on Uncle 
Willoughbya€™ s largesse, but I remembered the embarrassment of having to ask for an advance from 
time to time. Sir Roderick looked not unsympathetic, though why he looked at me I couldna€™ t say, 
and the business was quickly completed.
Sir Roderick was still smiling but didna€™t look terribly happy, if you know the expression I mean, 
when he stepped forward. Tuppy must have bit him for a whacking good sum. Honeymoon money, perhaps? 
a€oeMr. Woostera€“a€D His smile if anything was more forced. a€oeHildebrand has aa€!tiresome 
formality to conclude before lunch. Would you care to indulge me in a game of billiards while we 
wait?a€D

Billiards was exactly what I wanted to work up an appetite for lunch. a€oeCapital idea, Sir 
Roderick.a€D

The billiard room was deserted, a condition nearly unheard of at the Drones. Sir Roderick proved to 
be an acceptable player, if somewhat given to leisurely shots. One time he spent a solid minute 
studying his shot, the billiard room quiet enough that I could hear a church bell tolling somewhere 
in the distance. Shortly afterwards Tuppy rejoined us, looking solemn enough that I wondered if he 
hadna€™ t been negotiating with a bookie rather than contemplating
matrimony.

It was still early for lunch, so Tuppy and I played another game after Sir R. and I finished, and 
then I stood by and offered helpful advice while Tuppy played his uncle. By the time that round was 
over it was time to get outside some calories.

The dining room at the Bellona was pleasant enough, not as sprightly as the Drones, of coursea€“one 
could not use a ballistic bread roll to punctuate and argument, one felta€“but airy and 
well-appointed. The headwaiter was able to seat us without delay despite the growing crowd. 
Scarcely had we been seated when a beak at the next table turned around.

Scarcely had we been seated when a beak at the next table turned around.
a€oeWooster, old man!a€D Flim gave the glad cry. a€oeGood to see you again. You know my friend 
Freddy Arbuthnot?a€D he asked, waving to the chap at the table with him.

Oofy Prosser had introduced us once when I ran into them lunching at the Baribault, so I said hullo 
and then made the round of introductions at our table. Arbuthnot and Sir Roderick already knew each 
other, illustrating Jeevesa€™ s wheeze about it being a small world. They hadna€™ t seen each other 
for a while, so the rest of the conversation was put on hold for a time as they asked how Old 
So-and-So was doing.

Flim and Arbuthnot were wearing the same ruddy flower as everyone else. Even the waiter, hovering 
to take our orders, was sporting one, looking like a splash of fresh blood on his chest. A rifle 
shot to the heart bleeds surprisingly little, the organ and the man dead before it can pump out 
much blood. Private Jones had looked like that, just a tidy red spot and a calm white face. I 
couldna€™ t believe he was dead until I turned him over and saw the mangled mess
the bullet had made exiting his back.

Lieutenant Wimsey turned to look at me, all the blood leaving his face like it had the privatea€™ 
s. He was dead; they were all dead, all the corpses with their neat little bullet wounds, waltzing 
around the room in nightmarish parody of life. One of the corpses leaned towards me and I jerked 
back, remember the clammy feel of dead flesh. My chair overset, dropping me backwards. I think I 
screamed when Lt. Wimseya€™ s body fell on top of me. Knowing the
Germans would hear I forced myself to silence as I tried in vain to struggle out from under his 
weight.

I felt a prick on my left shoulder, a sting like a bee. How strange that that would hurt more than 
a bullet to the heart. My strength was ebbing, the lights dimming. I could only hope Sgt. White and 
the boys would forgive me for being so late.
Just before the lights went out for the last time I heard a voice speak.

a€oel always carry a sedative on Armistice Day.a€D
