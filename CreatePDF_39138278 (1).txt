Note on Kaiping Mine (Hoover and Chang)

Xiaosang Huang
Nov 15,2021

The narratives by Hoover might incline in obscuring negative revelations about his role in 
exercising deliberate manipulations in the case of patrimony transfer of Kaiping Mine from the 
Chinese government to English corporation. It is from his recounts as a major source, the former 
leader Chang is usually understood as a corrupt and incapable feudal bureaucrat who
readily sell the Kaiping Mine to shun his responsibilities in saving its declining output and 
accumulating debts, to gain more personal interests, and to avoid attacks from the Boxers. Such 
stigmatizing narration is further corroborated by predominant attacks of Chang's irresponsibility 
from Chinese officials led by one of the most powerful military politicians, Yuan
Shihkai, in 1903.

However, to better understand this specific figure's role in the patrimony issue of Kaiping Mine, 
and whether Hoover played the role of a selfless helper to save the whole mine and executing his 
leader Chang from angry Boxers, it might be helpful to also investigate other sources to picture 
the event in a holistic perspective. Regarding the Chinese documental records and
consecutive explanatory articles published on Ta Kung Pao by Yan Fu, the famous Chinese scholar who 
assisted Chang in Kaiping Mine's case and has unbiased first-hand insights, Chang is a patriarch 
who made the contract with Detring as a temporal compromise. The Kaiping Mine's production and 
transportation were severely impeded by the occupation of the eight­
nation alliance in July 1900, which is the major reason accounting for its declined output as well 
as the motivation for Chang to seek asylum in British power as companies being investors, which is 
also out of the will to save the mine from completely subjecting its patrimony to Russian power. 
Other documents also indicate that Chang made the contract with Detring
under the threat of being detained by the British embassy in Tianjin (accusation of raising pigeons 
to deliver messages in alliance with the Boxers), while the later business manipulations by Hoover 
and Moreing's company might lead to the final complete transfer in Kaiping Mine's patrimony.

The general stigma on Chang is partly the consequence of Yuan Shihkai's intention to step over 
modern industries and other political purposes, and the one-sided narration by Hoover who was 
suspected to collaboratively intrigued the business plan with the aid of British embassy powers 
with Detring and Moreing. Such deliberate manipulations were validated by the
court decision of Chang's case ended in favor of the plaintiff. Overall, readers should take a 
careful judgment over the credentials of Hoover's prevailing narration on his role and initiatives 
in the case of Kaiping Mine.
