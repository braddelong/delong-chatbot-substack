John Stuart Mill: War Is an Ugly Thing: a€~But [it is] not the ugliest of things: the decayed and 
degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth a war, is much 
worse. When a people are used as mere human instruments for firing cannon or thrusting bayonets, in 
the service and for the selfish purposes of a master, such war degrades a people. A war to protect 
other human beings against tyrannical injustice; a war to give victory to
their own ideas of right and good, and which is their own war, carried on for an honest purpose by 
their free choice-is often the means of their regeneration. A man who has nothing which he is 
willing to fight for, nothing which he cares more about than he does about his personal safety, is 
a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made and kept so by the exertions of 
better men than himself. As long as justice and injustice have not terminated
their ever-renewing fight for ascendancy in the affairs of mankind, human beings must be willing, 
when need is, to do battle for the one against the othera€!

Bret Devereaux: Understanding the War in Ukraine: a€~How Will This End? Badly. Beyond that, no one 
really knowsa€!. Putin is likely to carry this war to its conclusion. The reputational cost of 
turning back now, with blood already shed, would be catastrophica€!. The balance of equipment and 
numbers suggests that Russian forces are very likely to wina€! [but] a€~swift Russian victorya€™ 
isa€!. a rapidly vanishing possibilitya€!. We can be pretty sure
that the human toll here is going to be terriblea€!

Michael Kofman: d€™ Today may have been the worst day for the Russian military in Ukraine so far. 
They are still advancing, but there were a # of videos of destroyed or abandoned equipment and 
units. I have no idea why they sent in a small spetsnaz unit into Kharkiv, but it was easily 
repelled. It is clear they hoped to get Zelensky to surrender quickly without inflicting heavy 
casualties on the Ukrainian military/civilians. That failed, but their execution still
appears to be fairly restrained (e.g. in Kharkiv without armor). Certainly concerned plan B is more 
force. Theya€™re trying to further resource a failed strategy, neither willing to concede it was 
based on completely ridiculous assumptions, or open up a brutal warfighting effort using the bulk 
of the military power they have assembled. And they have ended up in the worst of all worlds. One 
must wonder when they will make the switch to more of a total war type
strategy. I am surprised that after day two when it was apparent light force wasna€™ t working they 
would. Maybe their command structure is far less reactive than we thoughta€!

@RobertJ585 @RALee85 @EvansRyan202 The limitation is a political constraint not a military 
constraint. Nothing more common in warfare than to see a leader make a terrible mistake, and then 
agree to trickle mil resources into what is visibly a failed strategy, so that it fails more 
expensively.
