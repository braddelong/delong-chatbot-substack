College graduates, after all, are the winners in our society. College certainly changed my life: My father was a high school dropout, but his daughter is a Harvard professor. My student loans (which I paid off just a few years ago) were absolutely worth it…. But today many of those who borrow for college do not graduate…. I now firmly believe that targeted debt cancellation is the best way to undo the damage done to millions of borrowers by a persistently dysfunctional system of college funding and student loan repayment. What changed my thinking? Decades of political paralysis around fixing that funding system. An unending increase in tuition prices and student borrowing. And a growing body of evidence showing harm to students who have borrowed to cover mounting college costs. College used to be nearly free…. A decade ago, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/upshot/were-frighteningly-in-the-dark-about-student-debt.html">we had only a sketchy portrait</a> of how this debt affected borrowers’ lives…. It was the Obama administration that released more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/upshot/new-data-gives-clearer-picture-of-student-debt.html">detailed data</a>…. Contrary to the popular narrative, the huge run-up in defaults has not been driven by $100,000 debts incurred by students at expensive private colleges. Rather, they are driven by $8,000 loans at for-profit colleges and, to a lesser extent, community colleges. These are the borrowers who will benefit from the Biden loan forgiveness policy…</p></blockquote><p>I confess that my attitude toward student loan repayment has long been a combination of: </p><ol><li><p>Isn't there a better way to build the money to build capacity?</p></li><li><p>Isn’t there a more progressive way to improve the distribution of wealth? </p></li><li><p>Don’t we want to retard rather than accelerate the shift of power to the presidency and so keep the United States from being a semi-elective dictatorship for as long as possible?</p></li></ol><p>But as for (3), I now think that it is too late. People talk about how “secret congress” can still work. But that requires that issues not be “partisanized”. And looking forward at the Republican Party of the future, it seems to me that nothing can be departisanized. The only hope for technocratic policy in the future is for a (Democratic) president to say “this is how things are going to be, but you can come along on the train and get some credit.”</p><p>(2) and (1) still hold. But I find myself sliding towards a different set of questions. The questions I find myself sliding towards are:</p><ol><li><p>Is this a bad thing? (Answer: no.)</p></li><li><p>Will this stabilize a coalition that will make it easier to do good things in the future? (Answer: yes.)</p></li><li><p>Is there a better thing that this forecloses that would otherwise happen with high probability? (Answer: no.)</p></li></ol><p>Given the answers to those questions, the only remaining question is whether the costs of an extra $35 billion a year of federal deficit are higher than the benefits of this not-bad thing. I strongly think that there are no net costs to an extra $35 billion a year of federal deficit as long as the Fed continues to hold to its 2%/year inflation target. The2%/year inflation target world is one in which “secular stagnation” remains likely. It is one in which the world remains desperately short of U.S. Treasuries, and so creating an extra $35 billion/year of U.S. Treasuries remains a no-brainer.</p><p>Could we spend the money doing better things? Yes, but what? Show up with a plan signed by 50 senators willing to use Reconciliation to accomplish it, and we can talk. Otherwise, I don’t think critics have much to say.</p><p>And, indeed, the fact that critics don’t have much to say seems to me to be proved by the LOUD! criticisms I hear:</p><ul><li><p>Biden is giving $10,000 to women who majored in Lesbian Dance Therapy!</p></li><li><p>Biden should call it the “Inflation Acceleration Act”!</p></li><li><p>Biden should have put forward a plan for comprehensive higher education reform!</p></li></ul><p>I do have a plan for higher-education reform: put some teeth in the inheritance tax and add-on a super-income tax bracket to have the federal government pay tuition for the first two years of state-run state and community college and training-apprenticeship programs. Build human capital capacity as we should have been doing for the past fifty years.</p><p>What’s that? You don’t have 50 senators on board?</p><p>Too bad.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/why-do-people-think-10000-of-student?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/why-do-people-think-10000-of-student?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Takatoshi Ito: </strong><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/japan-lessons-for-taiwan-chinese-aggression-by-takatoshi-ito-2022-08">Japan’s Lessons for Taiwan</a></p></li><li><p>Brad DeLong: <a href="https://www.friendlycitybooks.com/utopia">Slouching Towards Utopia — Friendly City Books</a>: ’September 12 at noon…</p></li><li><p><strong>Sarah Neville: </strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/26e0731f-15c4-4f5a-b2dc-fd8591a02aec">The Growing Evidence that Covid-19 Is Leaving People Sicker</a>: ‘The potential impact on heart and brain disease poses challenges to healthcare systems globally...</p></li><li><p><strong>Paul Kedrosky: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/pkedrosky/status/1564707002223169537">“With news today</a> that Meta and Snap are doing layoffs, I am reminded that layoffs are accelerating in the U.S., especially in tech.
