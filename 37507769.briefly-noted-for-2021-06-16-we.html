(b) The&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;has not “fallen into a trap”. It is aggressively misinforming its readers in pursuit of clickbait.</p><p>Moral fault attaches to anyone who supports it:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Thomas Levenson</strong>:&nbsp;<em>’I may teach</em>&nbsp;this&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;article in my science journalism class next year as a model of how to do it wrong. Amy Qin and Chu Bailiang are expert and knowledgable China reporters. They seem in this piece out of their depth on the science. I don’t have time right now (deadlines of my own) to fisk the problems in this piece fully… so I’ll just point to two problems very quickly. They are clearly drawing on others’ work to describe each of the alleged scenarios for a lab escape origin for the COVID pandemic… Their account follows closely the arguments from Nicholas Wade, who lost his connection to&nbsp;<em>New York Times Science</em>&nbsp;because of his commitment to motivated reasoning on race and genetics…. </p><p>In repeating very similar claims without scrutiny, the writers (and their editors) fall into one of the most annoying and damaging habits of herd journalism: amplifying a story because others are touting it, and not because they’ve subjected the details of the story itself to anything like rigorous tests. (An aside: Even though I think Wade &amp; Baker made claims well beyond the evidence, they’ve suffered the same fate of a lot of freelancers: seeing what they’ve written taken up in the Gray Lady without any hint that someone got their first. It was ever thus.) </p><p>Back to the point (I do have one. Or two.) By accepting the lab-escape framework as the premise of their story, Amy Qin and Chu Bailiang have fallen into the same trap their politics desk colleagues did in, say, the Clinton emails story… taking the bait on a loud story that repeatedly holds up poorly as each aspect of it is examined carefully. Given the evidence that pushing the idea that China foisted this disaster on the world has clear political motives behind it and aims before it, some caution would be indicated. And yet, despite bitter experience (never fully acknowledged within the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;newsroom) here we are again…. </p><p>When I show this piece to my students this fall, I’ll ask them to see who is quoted, &amp; how support for the two options–lab escape or natural origin–are described. They’ll find that only lab-escape proponents are quoted (except for the Chinese scientist under indictment), and that in the abstract, the lab-escape partisans are treated as equivalent in expertise and especially number or weight to the those pursuing evidence of a zoonotic origin for the virus. Is that true? No, gentle reader. It is not… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/TomLevenson/status/1404834728793026563">https://twitter.com/TomLevenson/status/1404834728793026563</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p></p><h3>Plus: A Snippet from a Dialogue:</h3><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal</strong>: WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT INFLATION SO MUCH? For today’s Markets newsletter, I wrote about inflation, the Fed, and why Treasury yields have been going down lately, despite some high and hot CPI prints…</p><p><strong>Max Kennerly</strong>: Kind of a good reminder why PCE is a better measurement. We don’t need to fiddle with inclusions and exclusions for spikes or drops in particular sectors, it does that automatically…</p><p><strong>Brad DeLong</strong>: We shouldn’t be talking about inflation&nbsp;<strong>at all</strong>&nbsp;right now: we have much bigger fish to fry. We should be talking about how we get 10M more workers back to work in þe right jobs as fast as possible, accepting þt we are leaving rubber on þe road as we do so…</p><p><strong>Larissa</strong>: Exactly. Especially since JPMorgan is using inflation panic as an excuse to hoard cash–even though inflationary fears should result in spending cash immediately because its buying power would diminish over time…·</p><p><strong>Brad DeLong</strong>: We should be postponing worrying about inflation until 2023, when we will see where we are. Why? Because þe Fed has a straightforward way of reducing demand &amp; cooling off inflation if it turns out þt demand is too high, but we have no good way of boosting demand if it turns out it is too low. Given þe enormous uncertainty, þe asymmetries þt emerge when you walk down þe strategy tree dominate. Until þose uncertainties resolve, no reasonable case for tightening immediately can be made.&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/delong/status/1404848286171746308">https://twitter.com/delong/status/1404848286171746308</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-06-16-we?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-06-16-we?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Rene Ritchie</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Apple VP Answers YOUR Watch &amp; Health Questions!</em>: ‘Apple’s Kevin Lynch, VP of Technology, and Deidre Caldbeck, Product Marketing, chat with us about their histories with Apple Watch and Health, new features like ID cards and keys, how they decide on new features, how they made Assistive Touch for Watch, bringing Mobility to iPhone, the visual representation and security of Health information, security vs sharing, and the future of Apple Health!… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEi0wlWYW_M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEi0wlWYW_M</a>&gt;:</p><div id="youtube2-MEi0wlWYW_M" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;MEi0wlWYW_M&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MEi0wlWYW_M?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted<strong>:</strong>  </h2><ul><li><p><strong>John F.

Innovation is a mentality, of constantly perfecting and optimising everything and anything around us, and it spreads from person to person. But there was nothing special about Britain in having people with the improving mentality. There was no uniquely British disposition, or national culture of innovation, whatever that is (bizarrely, I’m occasionally cited as saying as much). Far from it. A disproportionate number of the inventors of the period were immigrants, and I think the improving mentality arrived from abroad anyway, in the mid-sixteenth century. What made Britain special was that the improving mentality became especially viral there. Inventors in Britain, initially by accident, and increasingly on purpose, were especially good at organising themselves into innovation-promoting societies, creating norms for the sharing of inventions, lobbying elites for funding, or to pass laws that favoured innovation, and finding ways to raise the social status of being an inventor. The cause of Britain’s acceleration of innovation was the success of its innovation evangelists — usually inventors themselves, with a fair few non-inventors cheering from the side-lines too…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://antonhowes.substack.com/p/age-of-invention-honours-for-innovators">https://antonhowes.substack.com/p/age-of-invention-honours-for-innovators</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Time to start heavily penalizing and surtaxing states that are NIMBYist, IMHO:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Will Wilkinson</strong>:&nbsp;<em>NIMBYism &amp; the Externalities of Non-Development</em>: ’It’s conventional wisdom that land use regulation, like zoning, is a “local issue.” It isn’t, really…. Crazy regional variation in housing costs undermines the effectiveness of federal monetary and fiscal policy, compounding the massive macroeconomic cost of our systemic, zoning-driven misallocation of labor. Moreover, restrictive zoning in America’s superstar cities effectively subsidizes the growth of hotter, more sprawling (but less productive) runner-up cities, such as Phoenix and Austin, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and climate risk thanks to their heavy reliance on air conditioners and cars. All of which is to say, the fact that zoning’s locus of control tends to be local doesn’t mean that it’s a “local issue.” This is important to emphasize because the most promising path to the amelioration of our deepening housing affordability crisis involves a rebalancing of authority over land use regulation in the direction of state and even federal government…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/nimbyism-and-the-externalities-of">https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/nimbyism-and-the-externalities-of</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Very funny. &amp; very true:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ed Zitron</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Remote Debate Shows The Brittle State of Modern Management</em>: ’A fairly large cadre of people that take deep, painful offense at the suggestion that middle management isn’t necessary….

In a functional management system, if a team is failing the manager is the one whose ass is on the line… There are many managers who can’t manage, and there are many jobs that don’t require managers at all…. The irony of many executives banging on about how we “must return to the office” is that they’re definitely people who’ve talked about how you need to be a “self-starter.”… The reason that shitty managers are so common is that they… do not have enough shit to do—management that actually needs to exist generally has enough on their plate that they can’t micro-manage, and indeed won’t do so because they trust the people they’re managing.
