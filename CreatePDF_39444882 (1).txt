Steven Maurer:

Everything we're proud of, everything we think we do better than the Victorians is basically one 
single trick: the transistor in '47. After that, we can
suddenly make machines using lithography, which unleashes a second Gutenberg revolution in the 
economy. Physical goods like adding machines suddenly
become information goods like Excel. And now all the old publishing world problems about products 
with zero marginal cost come back with a vengeance,
along with all the more or less bad IP solutions for dealing with incentives for such products. And 
since the transistor is a product of Bell Labs, there are all
the difficulties about how you fund innovation, maybe knowing that almost all the money will be 
wasted but not caring if it buys you one cool thing and
how does one think about that? Presumably there would have been an independent inventor within a 
year or two, there was after all a large investment in
solid-state physics research, but what if it had never happened at all?

Also there is a prehistory to the story: The previous analog to transistors (which, alas, could not 
be lithographed) was the vacuum tube, which directly
descends from the light bulb and is first cousin to TV and particle accelerators. And it is also 
the basis of wartime computer designs which are immediately
transistorized as soon as the opportunity presents. How narrow the basis for everything turns out 
to be! And then once we have the technology, it takes us
seventy  years to work out the products we can usefully make from it and to teach new generations 
enough to actually be receptive to the possibilities, and
still                                                                    no end in sighta€!
