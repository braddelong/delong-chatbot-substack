Very Briefly Noted:

• Matthew Yglesias: The FDA vs. Cost-Benefit Analysis'. a€~The best waya€! for U.S. public health 
agencies to have the confidence of the American public is for them to make decisions that are 
defensible on the
meritsa€!. A solid track record of saying true things and giving advice that makes sense helps 
bolster your reputation over time. Resorting to Wizard-of-Oz tacticsa€! creates an increasingly 
brittle systema€!
subject to catastrophic failurea€! <https://www.slowboring.eom/p/fda-cost-benefit>

• Noah Smith: Haiti vs. the Dominican Republic. a€~The countries of Haiti and the Dominican 
Republica€!. The economic divergencea€! isa€! remarkablea€!. As recently as 1960, the two countries 
had similar
standards of living. Today, the D.R., by some measures, is eight times as rich as Haiti, while 
Haitia€™ s standard of living hasna€™ t advanced at all since 1950a€! LINK:

Paragraphs:

Noah Smith: Why Is China Smashing Its Tech Industry?: a€~China never really shifted out of survival 
modea€!. Growth has always been toward the telos of comprehensive national power. ChinaaC™ s young 
people may be
increasingly ready to cash out and have some fun, but the leadership is just not therea€!. They 
have to avenge the Century of Humiliation and claim Chinaa€™ s rightful place in the sun and blah 
blaha€!. ChinaaC™ s leaders
look at what kind of technologies they want the countrya€™ s engineers and entrepreneurs to be 
spending their effort on, [and] theya€! dona€™ t wanta€! stuffa€! for fun and convenience^!. Their 
consumer internet
sector[a€™ s]a€! linka€! [to] geopolitical power had simply become too tenuous to keep throwing 
capital and high-skilled labor at it. And so, in classic CCP fashion, it was time to smasha€!

Dan Rosen: Is Xi a Failure? Plus: Older Gentlemen Autocrat Tendencies, Odds of Taiwan Invasion, & 
Whata€™ s the Point of Liberal Governance Anyways?: a€~I wonder if there a€™ s a book to be written 
ten years from
now on how the twelve months from end-of-summer 2015 to December 2016 was thea€! decisive yeara€!. 
Suddenly you saw companiesa€! saying, a€oeHey, our Chinese JV partner just handed us this note 
requesting we
revise our articles of association to give the party committee a de jure role in the corporate 
governance structure ,a€da€ I The national champions who stepped up never stepped back and just 
evolved their role to now
becoming investors in everything. So taking little equity nibbles across the entire economy, 
oftentimes just single percentage points, but nonetheless, now you have Central Huijin and others 
with investments every wherea€!

Katie Baker: The Day the Good Internet Died: a€~For a small slice of time, being online was a 
thrilling mix of discovery, collaboration, creativity, and chaotic potential. Then Google Reader 
disappeareda€!. Google Reader
is not the worlda€™ s first RSS newsreadera€!. But ita€™ s the one that caught on. And using it 
requires little effort to yield satisfying, orderly rewardsa€!. Ita€™ s the year 2021a€!. Ita€™ s 
that blasted a€oeoh hello, are
you doomscrolling?a€n Twitter bot getting retweeted into my feeda€!. Often ita€™ s sponsored 
content, and I can never tell which servicea€™ s offerings leave me more unsettleda€!. Logging on 
feels like participating in
the setup to a Yogi Berra 2.0 a€oeterrible food, and such small portions!a€Da€“style jokea€”except 
that the punch line is about, like, public health statistics instead of prime rib. In the past week 
alone, the president of the
United States and Facebook, each citing the tech companya€™ s handling of pandemic info, have 
bickered publicly about, oh, just Facebooka€™ s ratio of murderousness to societal benefita€!. When 
Google Reader
disappeared in 2013, it wasna€™ t just a tale of dwindling user numbers or of what one engineer 
later described as a rotted codebase. It was a sign of the crumbling of the very foundation upon 
which it had been built: the era
of    the Good Interneta€!. Google had purchased Blogger back in 2003, and in an interview with 
Playboy in 2004, founder Sergey Brin outlined a vision for his company that felt extremely bloggy: 
a€oeWe want to get you out
of Google and to the right place as fast as possible,a€D he said. But nothing gold can stay, and as 
smartphones and tablets and apps and social networks began to supplement and then supplant the 
simple-text-on-a-desktop
experience near the start of the 2010s, Googlea€™ s corporate frame of mind shifted ever-inwarda€!
