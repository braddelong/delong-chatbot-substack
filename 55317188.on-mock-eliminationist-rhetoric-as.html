(But what else is new?):</p><blockquote><p><strong>Liam Bright</strong>: <em>’This</em>: <strong>Morgan J. Freeman</strong> @mjfree: “Being ‘anti-racist’ starts by admitting ‘whiteness’ is a disease…” from a well-followed [260K] blue-tick account, himself white. </p><p>To put the point mildly it’s not ideal messaging. But it also seems so hubristic to claim anti-racism requires knowing this sorta humanities talk. People have been anti-racist a long time without needing EdTheory degrees. </p><p>Re: the messaging—on its surface it so much sounds like “build up to mass murder talk”. Of course people balk. And we all even know that was the point! That was how it sounded edgy and attention-grabbing at academic conferences. No action is intended, but it’s cool to insinuate. </p><p>Really I basically think the academic humanities have vastly too much and the wrong sort of influence on contemporary activism. We’re bad and we’ve made what we’ve touched worse…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/lastpositivist/status/1526334892593799175&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;This from a well followed blue tick account, himself white.

And so he profoundly mistakes the situation. </p><p>The right thing for him to do is to take lessons from Daniel Davies:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Daniel Davies</strong>: <em>Rules for Contrarians: 1. Don’t Whine. That Is All</em>: ‘I like to think that I know a little bit about contrarianism. So I’m disturbed to see that people who are making roughly infinity more money than me out of the practice aren’t sticking to the unwritten rules of the game…. If you start a fight, you can hardly be surprised that you’re in a fight. It’s the definition of passive-aggression and really quite unseemly, to set out to provoke people, and then when they react passionately and defensively, to criticise them for not holding to your standards of a calm and rational debate…. If you’re writing a contrarian piece properly, you ought to be well aware of what point it looks like you’re making, because the entire point is to make a defensible argument which strongly resembles a controversial one. So having done this intentionally, you don’t get to complain that people have “misinterpreted” your piece by taking you to be saying exactly what you carefully constructed the argument to look like you were saying…. Contrarians ought to have thick skins, because their entire raison d’etre is the giving of intellectual offence to others. So don’t whine, for heaven’s sake. Own your bullshit…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2009/10/22/rules-for-contrarians-1-dont-whine-that-is-all/">https://crookedtimber.org/2009/10/22/rules-for-contrarians-1-dont-whine-that-is-all/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>And this is a very nice follow-up:</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/cstross/status/1526480014996344832&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;<span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@lastpositivist</span> <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@delong</span> It also reflects the specifically Christian doctrine of original sin, which is extremely unhelpful—if the writer interprets everything through a religious lens they'll likely only be receptive to religious solutions, and blind to non-religious ones.&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;cstross&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Charlie Stross&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Tue May 17 08:29:30 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:3,&quot;like_count&quot;:54,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/cstross/status/1526480014996344832" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/cstross.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @cstross" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">Charlie Stross </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@cstross</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text"><span class="tweet-fake-link">@lastpositivist</span> <span class="tweet-fake-link">@delong</span> It also reflects the specifically Christian doctrine of original sin, which is extremely unhelpful—if the writer interprets everything through a religious lens they'll likely only be receptive to religious solutions, and blind to non-religious ones.</div></a><a class="tweet-link-bottom" href="https://twitter.com/cstross/status/1526480014996344832" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><span class="tweet-date">8:29 AM ∙ May 17, 2022</span><hr><div class="tweet-ufi"><span href="https://twitter.com/cstross/status/1526480014996344832/likes" class="likes"><span class="like-count">54</span>Likes</span><span href="https://twitter.com/cstross/status/1526480014996344832/retweets" class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">3</span>Retweets</span></div></div></a></div><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/BeijingPalmer/status/1526883714604605442&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;<span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@cstross</span> <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@lastpositivist</span> <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@delong</span> was thinking exactly this, along with the follow-up that you can't, in this way of thinking, be saved by deeds alone but by the grace of theory.
