A century and a half later, we have failed to reach the leisure society of Keynes, much less the classless society of Marx, or any of the other visions of heaven on Earth…. DeLong’s book is self-styled as a “grand narrative” rather than a dry academic analysis. He offers a strong perspective, in contrast to a book like Mark Koyama and Jared Rubin’s <em>How the World Became Rich</em>… performing a long survey of the many competing perspectives…. <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em> is in this way much more like Robert Gordon’s <em>The Rise and Fall of American Growth</em>; each book allows both the lay reader and the specialist to walk away with a greater grasp of the general economic history of the time period covered, and both offer a strong thesis that remains controversial among specialists….</p><p>The rationalization of invention and the routinization of diffusing innovations at scale; that is the basic logic behind the role of the research lab and the corporation in DeLong’s grand narrative. But the manner in which it was rationalized and routinized is explored in far less depth…. How <em>exactly</em> did the research lab and the corporation empower these men to accomplish these tremendous feats? And why did no one think to gather “communities of engineering practice to supercharge economic growth” before 1870? It seems answers to these questions were <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/braddelong/p/slouching-omission-mishandling-the?r=13cw5&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email">left on the cutting room floor</a>.</p><p>What DeLong <em>does</em> do, however, is no less valuable…. He moves on to <em>what</em> exactly happened, and <em>how</em> the world was transformed by this unexpected pivot from millennia of stagnation to a “long century” of slouching onward and upward…. He encourages his readers to constantly consider the conflicting moral perspectives of Friedrich Hayek on the marvels of the market and Karl Polanyi on its dangers in order to evaluate the flow of events he narrates from a broader perspective than either. It is difficult to conceive of a reader who will fail to come away from <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em> with their knowledge and their perspective enlarged; the breadth of what is covered is staggering…. </p><p>We ought… to take a page from DeLong’s “grand narrative” and get to thinking about the steps we might take to press ahead—even if we must do so at a slouch, and even if we never quite arrive at utopia in the end. </p></blockquote><p>As I said at the SSHA <em>Slouching </em>panel on Saturday:</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:85633405,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/in-which-i-quibble-wi-paul-krugman&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:47874,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot; In Which I Quibble wiþ Paul Krugman, &amp;&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;CONDITION: The Benefits of Central Heating!

forwards into technology, industry, and society; and forwards into economy, sociology, and polity. And I thought I could accomplish it. As Michael Walzer once told me, when one starts a book project one is confident that at the end, when one holds the finished copy in one’s hands and opens it, one will see letters of fire that will by the logic of iron necessity inscribe their truth directly on the minds and souls of readers, and that the book will be <em>κτῆμά τε ἐς αἰεὶ, </em>a treasure for all time. But when the actual book appeared—no letters of fire, no direct truth, just chicken-scratchings that were not even the shadows on the wall of the cave, but rather vague gestures in the direction of shadows from which a good-hearted and hard-working reader might learn <em><strong>something.</strong></em></p><p>Basic is not in the business of publishing thousand-page books. </p><p>And I very much doubt that I could have successfully executed a thousand-page book: the difficulty of the dive goes with the square of the number of pages. I wound up writing a book looking forward from 1870 that is overwhelmingly about the political-economy consequences of the magnificent explosion in the rate of technology-driven growth, with occasional side-glances at the parts of the original project that I was unable to execute.</p><p>I wish I had answers to give Adam to the questions he asks: How <em>exactly</em> did the research lab and the corporation empower these men to accomplish these tremendous feats? And why did no one think to gather “communities of engineering practice to supercharge economic growth” before 1870? But, alas, they are not even on the cutting-room floor. They are very hard and deep questions indeed. Was the explosion of wealth and productivity of 1870 causally-thin, in the sense that institutions had to evolve then in a way that was unlikely to get the explosion? Or was the growth acceleration of the Second industrial Revolution, the one big wave of Robert Gordon, causally-thick—largely baked in the cake, while the causally-thin nexus or nexuses came earlier?:</p><ul><li><p>Earlier this fall at Berkeley the extremely learned Robert Brenner lectured me for 45 minutes about how the true causally-thin nexus came much earlier: with the emergence, in the two centuries after the Black Death, in the 300 mile-radius circle around Dover, of market-bourgeois class relations, and thus the transformation of (a) a society of peasants, knights, lords, and the occasional merchant into (b) a society of laborers, craftsman, merchants, farmers, landlords, mercenaries, and plutocrat-politicians.</p></li><li><p>Had we managed to get Joel Mokyr as a discussant at the SSHA, he would surely have said that the causally-thin counterfactual nexus word was the founding of the Royal Society and <em><strong>nullius in verba</strong></em>, “nothing by word”. This shift from (a) ideas spreading primarily because they are useful to an upper class élite running a force-and-fraud domination-and-exploitation scheme on the rest of society, to (b) ideas spreading because they are true of empirical reality.</p></li><li><p>Nate Rosenberg and David Mowery would say that it was the diffusion of the steam engine that created a critical mass of engineers in the first two-thirds of the 1800s that was the key, and that once you had that critical mass the development f the industrial research lab was inevitable. Alfred DuPont Chandler would say similar things about the railroad: you had to build a corporation as we know it to run a railroad, and, once done, the advantages of diffusing that organizational form to other technology-frontier industries would become obvious.</p></li><li><p>Others would find different causally-thin critical nexuses:</p><ul><li><p>The consequences of the British-Dutch naval victories in the Wars of the League of Augsburg and of the Spanish Succession.</p></li><li><p>The Glorious Revolution of 1688.</p></li><li><p>Emperor Heinrich IV Salier, reportedly standing in the snow outside of the castle at Canossa in 1077, and the establishment there and then of the principle that the law is not just a tool for but binds even the most powerful.</p></li><li><p>Or you might even go back to the emergence of a strict monotheism—a God focused not on this world but on heaven and hell—in which case in this world one should praise the Lord, yes, but what is important here and now is to pass the ammunition.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>I wish I had a good answer. But already this year both Mark Koyama and Jared Rubin and Oded Galor have put in their own bids on these issues, set forth their own excellent analyses:</p><div id="youtube2-cmCNoOeEP5Q" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;cmCNoOeEP5Q&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cmCNoOeEP5Q?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay;

Historians… inescapably… write from a present-day perspective…. “Presentism” is not something that can simply be “corrected for,” like measurement error in a scientific experiment. Beyond this, history written with an eye to the present serves the common good. It illuminates how elements of our own world came into being, exposing the development of key political, social, and economic structures, tracing the effects of past choices, and offering insight into how change can take place…. What Sweet called “presentism” is to be accepted and even applauded, not denounced—at least to a certain extent. But at the same we need to be aware of the ways that it can also impoverish our understanding and appreciation of history.</p><p>The past… is a foreign country: weird, wonderful, and strange. Great historians give a visceral sense of this foreignness…. It took a very long time for historians to develop this sense of the strangeness of the past. Very few of the great historians of Western antiquity and the Middle Ages considered the societies they were writing about to be qualitatively different from their own…. This does not mean embracing moral relativism…. Understanding why slave owners or Nazis behaved as they did does not mean excusing them. But we do have to understand why… if we hope to understand why events played out as they did… a delicate balance between, on the one hand, trying to convey the sheer strangeness of the past, and, on the other, revealing its connections to the present and to our own concerns….</p><p>There is nothing more potentially liberatory than the sense of endless possibility that great history can open up — the sense that categories of thought and practice are not fixed, that the world can be made to change in all sorts of strange and unexpected ways. We may be driven, inescapably, by present-day concerns, but if we make the past look too much like the present, how can we envision a future that looks different from where we are now?…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 50% off a group subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48"><span>Get 50% off a group subscription</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h1>Oþer Things þt Went Whizzing by…</h1><h3>Very Briefly Noted:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Alan Blinder: </strong><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/alan-blinder-a-monetary-and-fiscal-history-of-the-us-1961-2021/">A Monetary and Fiscal History of the United States, 1961-2021</a>…</p></li><li><p><strong>Adam Ozimek:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/ModeledBehavior/status/1594713289774317573">‘My dissertation</a> has now been discussed in Slate, WaPo, Calculated Risk, but has only 7 academic citations…</p></li><li><p><strong>Matthew Zeitlin: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/MattZeitlin/status/1594713290562850817">‘Salame also supported Tom Emmer</a>, newly elected GOP whip and a longtime crypto booster.
