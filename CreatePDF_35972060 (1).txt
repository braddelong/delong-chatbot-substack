This is the DeLongTODAY Briefing. I am Brad DeLong, an economics professor at the University of 
California at Berkeley, and a sometime Deputy Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. This is the 
weekly DeLongTODAY briefing. Here I hold forth here on the Leigh Bureaua€™ s vimeo platform on my 
guesses as to what I think you most need to know about what our economy is doing to us right now.
I promised Wes Neff when he agreed to provide the infrastructure for this that I and my briefings 
would be: lively, interesting, curious, thoughtful, and relatively brief.

Relatively.

I promised I would provide briefings on a mix of: forecasting, politics, macroeconomic analysis, 
history, and political economy.

Today I continue to try to grapple with a big problem: I do not understand China, and I really need 
to. I started gnawing at this last week. And here I continue:

First, remember our five takeaways from last time:

1. Chinaa€™ s growth has created three Chinasa€”the Spain-level 60-million megacity growth poles, 
which also possess the worlda€™ s second-leading high-tech economy; the Poland-level 300-million 
coastal economy, which is the worlda€™ s largest export manufacturing mechine ever (and which is 
mostly integrated with the rest of the world much more than with Chinaa€™ s interior), and the 
Peru-level one-billion interior economy, whose performance
has been very good by global-south standards but sub-par by Pacific Rim standards.

2. All-in-all, Chinaa€’’coastal Chinaa€”has managed to grow about as fast as one would expect given 
(i) when it started its reform process, and (ii) that it is located on the Pacific Rim.

3. China managed to grow at a Pacific Rim pace by stepping away from really-existing 
socialism-style planning and implementing a market economy.

4. China accomplished this in seven stages: (i) rural de-communization, (ii) growth of TVEs, (iii) 
urban retail decontrol, (iv) successfully dismantling the SOEs, (v) the great rural interior-urban 
coast migration, (vi) housing privatization, and (vii) the WTO-undervalued RMB-export manufacturing 
push.

5. Last takeaway from last time: This was not at all easy. Other countries that attempted to 
transition to a market economya€”to a€oestep away from the plana€Da€’’suffered a decade-long 
depression, underwent enormous political turmoil, and ended with a system that was substantially 
dysfunctional both in its political and its economic aspects. China managed it.

Let me stress that: China managed it. a€oeStepping Away from the PlanaCD was not easy. In the 
former Soviet bloc to Chinaa€™ s east moving to a market economy was hellish. It took a deep 
decade-long depression to do it. And even afterwards it left societies that were deeply wounded 
economicallya€’’and politically. Politically, far too many of the former Soviet bloca€™ s 
ex-planned economies are fascist or fascist-adjacent. Economically, they lack much
dynamisma€’’Poland is doing best, and Poland is eworking only as a cheap labor soure for Germanya€™ 
s Weltexportmeister economy.

How did China manage to grow enormously during the process of creating a market economya€”a process 
that was a horrific disaster in the USSR and in much of the rest of eastern Europe? It required 
government economic management, and very skillful government economic management.

Thus when someonea€”even someone as brilliant and as incredibly knowledgeable as UCSDa€™ s Barry 
Naughton says that China over 1978-2006 was not a a€oedevelopmental statea€D because all it was 
doing was building a market economy from scratcha€”and doing so with nothing, with neither bricks 
nor strawa€”my reaction is not terribly favorable. That seems to me to miss the point. It is much 
easier to focus inventive and entrepreneurial effort in
sectors with large positive market externalities in a functioning market economy a€’’what the other 
Pacific Rim a€oedevelopmental statesa€D dida€”than to build one from scratch, all the while 
providing the ruling bureaucrats and cadres with incentives for cooperating in the a€oestepping 
away from the plana€D. China did so with its use of TVEs, which was a policy of political-economy 
genius. And yet they also, somehow, managed to keep valuable state-
owned assets from being tunneled out into the control of oligarchs. They dealt with the dismantling 
of the state-owned sector without causing horrific social discontent from its stakeholders as they 
lost position, stability, and income. Anda€”most important from the CCPa€™ s point-of-viewa€”they 
somehow maintained the leading role of the CCP, something that very few would have thought could 
survive the stresses of successful rapid economic growth (or,
indeed, of unsuccessful rapid economic growth).

Moreover, the market economy that China managed to build was a successful onea€”a Pacific-Rim class 
one, rather than one like those of Latin America or Africa. Let us remind ourselves why the Pacific 
Rim economies have done so wella€”a happy coincidence of cultural, political, political economy, 
and economic factors. First was the relative absence of landlords: an entrenched 
non-entrepreneurial upper class with wealth based on assetsa€”a class whose
dominance might well be threatened by economic growth, and that viewed society as a whole as a 
sheep to be sheered. Closely connected was the presence of an at least semi-honest, and, important, 
competent bureaucracy. But it needs more: a bureaucracy that shares with the nation an agreed-on 
image of the future, and shares a sense of national purpose that a prosperous and productive 
country is the common goal.

Then it is not hard to see what is to be done with respect to industrial development: the richer 
countries of the world provide a target. And it is not that hard to see how it is to be 
donea€”simply copy what they did, leap-frogging where possible. And it is virtually certain 
thata€”if it can be accomplisheda€”it will be very profitable.

Infrastructure^’’investing in buildings, machines, and people. (A cultural tradition that values 
education helps a lot.) Resource mobilizationa€”much of it building the cities and the housing so 
people can move from the farm to the factory, plus creating the channels for savings and then for 
savings to be transformed into investment. (A long-lasting tradition of functional bureaucracy 
helps a lot.) Then there are the a€oeindustrial policya€D concerns: how to
nurture and grow communities of engineering practice, how to select and support firms that should 
growa€’’success at exporting, thus using the middle classes of richer countries as a 
quality-control mechanism, has provided reliable). An undervalued exchange rate and global-north 
markets open to your exports may well be the best of all industrial policies. Judicious controls to 
ensure that foreign exchange to invest for the future rather than boost elite
consumption in the present, thus wresting substantial control over resource allocation away from 
those the market usually gives it toa€”the rich, who want to consume luxuries, especially 
high-status foreign-made luxuries.

The amazing thing about China is that it succeeded in matching the rest of the Pacific Rim. It 
succeeded in doing this while suspended in mid-aira€’’without the market-economy underpinnings 
already in place, but managing to build the market-ecopnomy underpinnings, each stage just in time.

There is, however, a caveat: it did not match the other Pacific-Rim economiesa€”not really. The IB 
people of poor China had a decade-long headstart on Vietnama€™ s doi moi market reform program. And 
yet they have not gained vis-a-vis Vietnam at all since 1980. Admittedly, there are poor parts of 
Vietnam as well. And Poor China has done much to catch up to, say, the slow-growing Philippines. 
But there are a billion people in China who live in regions
that, while much more prosperous than their predecessors were back in the late 1970s, are not any 
sort of growth miracle. Plus there is the dire condition of Manchuria, which was in the 1950s the 
heart of the centrally-planned industrialization push.

As economist Nancy Qian points out, success at spurring growth for the billion people in the 
regions of the interior is of vital importance for the regime: a€oeThe Chinese governmenta€! will 
be preoccupied for at least another generation by the need to increase domestic incomesa€la€D And 
this is, I think, a major source of Xi Jinpinga€™ s push for a€oedual circulation^□a€”to keep the 
export machine running, while redirecting as much of the wealth it
generates to the interior as can be possibly done. This, too, will be a very difficult task.

The fact that Chinaa€™ s coast is now so much richer than the interior is one major reason that the 
Xi Jinping government feels it has to play the nationalism carda€”not just protecting China against 
natural disasters, but the claim that India and Southeast Asian countries objecting to Chinaa€™ s 
reinterpretation of international land and sea boundaries are a new colonialism.

Coastal China, howevera€”the coastal regions outside the major growth poles, together some 300 
milliona€”have matched the pace. Coastal China has not yet seen any middle-income slowdown. Coastal 
China has, I think, now caught up with Thailanda€”and is growing significantly faster than Malaysia 
was when Malaysia was at Coastal Chinaa€™ s current level of income. But the Four Tigers and the 
heyday of Japanese growth? Those are things that
Coastal China has not quite been able to matcha€l

And then there is Growth Pole China: the Lower Pearl River, Shanghai, and Beijinga€”extraordinarily 
rich because of the extraordinary regional concentration of wealth in China. What is its real per 
capita income? Perhaps it is roughly equal to that of the U.S. in the early 1970s. Certainly it 
looks much richer than Japan looked back then, at the time of the a€oeNixon ShockaCD that triggered 
the first of Japana€™ s two major economic gorwth slowdowns. Yet
so far there is no sign of such a middle-income slowdown in Chinaa€™ s three growth poles. And 
there is not even a slowdown like that of Taiwan island and South Korea after the 1998 East Asian 
financial crisis

It is against this background that, starting in 2005-2010, China began to reassert state guidance 
and state control over the economy: the government felt that it needed to do more than manage 
decontrol and promote exports. The theory is clear: where there are substantial externalitiesa€”in 
the nurturing of communities of engineering practice, saya€”the competitive market will 
systematically get prices a€cewronga€d. And where there are strategic
complementarities, only the government can elicit the confidence in A that B will make the 
investments that will make Aa€™ s business model profitable and also at the same time that A will 
make the investments that will make Ba€™ s business model profitable. Chinaa€™ s 2006 
a€ceMegaprojectsa€D were an attempt to move beyond simple decontrol and export promotion and do 
standard Pacific-Rim catchup industrial policy.

But then around 2010 things change bigtime. As Barry Naughton points out in his very new and very 
good short book, _The Rise of Chinaa€™ s Industrial Policy_: a€oeSince about 2010a€l the volume of 
resources the Chinese state invests in targeted sectors has been much greater than anything [in] 
Japan or Korea.a€D And the nature of the targetting is different: Japan and Korea when they were 
middle-income economies were playing catchup. Now China
appears to think that it can play leap-frog.

Why this shift around 2010? First, and I think most important, there was no obvious next pro-market 
reform to undertake. And yet the government is bureaucratically programmed at a deep level to set 
big goals and pursue them. Add to this the fact that the Great Recession hit in 2008. The Chinese 
government made the correct, Keynesian diagnosis that continued prosperity required that the 
governmetn spend money on something. And they found that having the
government take control of and maintain the economy-wide spending flow worksa€’’worked much better 
than the destructive austerity policies of Europe and of Americaa€™ s Republican Party. Moreover, 
they found that having the government exercise command-and-control over the banks worksa€’’rather 
than let them stampede for the exits, as both American and European regulators did, and so trigger 
fire-sale collapses in asset prices.

China came out of the Great Recession with great confidence in the technocratic competence and 
power of its governments’’certainly much better than the clowns of the North Atlantic. The next 
natural question was: What else can government do that works? Plus the failure of the global north 
to handle the Great Recession removed any belief in China that further a€oeconvergencea€D of 
Chinaa€™ s economic structure toward that of global north-style
a€ceneoliberalisma€D was an attractive goal.

And then add on to this scientific-bureaucratic-technocratic discontent at the idea that China, as 
a low-middle-income country, should a€oestay in its lanea€D. At least as Barry Naughton interprets 
Chinaa€™ s Innovation-Driven Development Strategy, it is based on a consensus belief among Chinaa€™ 
s engineering governors that China righ tnow has a once-in-a-century opportunity to get in on the 
ground floor of a technological revolution^’’revolutionary
new technologies that are intelligent and ubiquitous in communication, data, and artificial 
intelligence, a technological shift that is so disruptive that it is a positive disadvantage to 
have successfully implented earlier stages. In Chinese thought, global-north success at Industry 
3.0 will hobble their ability to implement Industry 4.0, and gives China the opportunity to 
leapfrog: with the largest mobile internet market, with 5Ga€™ s ability to create very low-latency
local networks, artificial intelligence ot make sense of what sensors producea€”we are talking 
about the potential not just for intelligent machines but intelligent factories.

In short, as Naughton interprets it, the belief in China is that a new General Purpose technology 
is there to be grasped, in which Chinaa€™ s relative backwardness is, as Thorstein Veblen and 
Alexander Gerschenkron had thought was and had been the case with Imperial Germanya€™ s rapid 
overtaking and surpassing of Great Britain at the end of the 1800s. There are no powerful 
entrenched incumbents a€oeoccupying the commanding heights of the technology
revolutiona€Da€! in the Industry 4.0 vision that is targeted by Chinaa€™ s Innovation-Driven 
Development Strategya€”or that, at least, is the plan.

Adding to this is a perceived U.S. declaration of technological war against China. Back in the 
1950s the founders of what was to become the European Union strove to make the economies of western 
Europe so interdependent that they would never dare wage war against each othera€”it would just be 
too expensive to break the links to prepare. But, in Chinaa€™ s perception, the U.S. has, as Abe 
Newman and Henry Farrell would term it, a€oeweaponized
interdependencea€na€”have decided to use interdependence to kneecap Chinese companies like Huawei. 
As Dan Wang reports, Chinaa€™ s rulers see a€oea relentless pace of US actions targeting Chinese 
companies has delivered unmistakable setbacks to their operationsa€la€D The resutl has been to 
align the interests of Chinaa€™ s leading tech companies with the statea€™ s interest in 
self-sufficiency and technological greatness. The U.S. under Trump
has        thus triggered a a€oeSputnik momenta€D in Chinaa€”a willingness of the state to spend 
without counting the cost to acquire technologies of its own so that it will never again be 
dependent to any meaningful extent on higher-level technology from outside.

This is clearest in artificial intelligence. Yes, Google in California is the global leader. Yes, 
it requires specialized chipsa€”a€oeneural enginesaCEl. But advances in machine learning have 
steadily democratized the field. There are few barriers to new entrants.

It looks as though China will deploy $2T US in purchasing power in this technological-leapfrog 
attempt. Upstream, China needs to make huge heavy lifts to create sources of server chips, desktop 
chips, and communications chips that the U.S. cannot strangle. That means investing in a€cefabsa€d, 
which now cost $10B US each _if nothing goes   wrong_ to build something that can manufacture       
 chips at the technological frontier. Right now   pretty much only
TSMC, Samsung, and Intel cana€”and Intel is having problems maintaining the pace. Further upstream 
are those who do not manufacture but design the chips: Intel (again), the ARM consortia, now Apple, 
Qualcomm, Samsunga€”and Huawei was getting into the game before the U.S. kneecapped it with 
sanctions.

Moreover in all of this the U.S. may well be looking and moving in the wrong direction. To quote 
Dan Wang again, he sees: a€oeA marketing trick that California pulled off to situate consumer 
internet as the highest form of technology, as if Tencent and Facebook are the surest signs that we 
live a technologically-accelerating civilization. The a€~techa€™         giants arehighly-capable 
companies that print cash. But theya€™re barely    engaged in the creation of
intellectual property, excelling instead on business-model innovation and the exploitation of 
network effectsa€la€d Getting very, very good indeed at figuring out how to glue peoplea€™ s 
eyeballs to the screen through fear or clickbait so that you can sell them ads does not lead to 
global future technological supremacy.

To back up, what does the Chinese government think it is doing? It says that it is building 
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics. But it knows damned well that is not what it is doing. It 
is instead, building Authoritarian State Surveillance Capitalism with Egalitarian Aspirations
In this task, the Chinese government thinks:

* It has absolutely nothing to learn from the United Statesa€”as GFC, Great Recession, anemic 
recovery, Trump, disinformation epidemic, coronavirus shows. The United States is a society in 
decline, living off of accumulated capital

* It controls the most magnificent and profitable export machine the world has ever seen. But the 
purpose of the export machine is not profita€”not to maximize profit by Chinaa€™ s slotting itself 
into the export-machine slot in the global division of labor

* The purpose of the export machine, rather, is to gain access to technology from value-chain 
partners and to gain worker and engineering experience to attain technological parity


And then there is Growth Pole China: the Lower Pearl River, Shanghai, and Beijinga€”extraordinarily 
rich because of the extraordinary regional concentration of wealth in China. What is its real per 
capita income? Perhaps it is roughly equal to that of the U.S. in the early 1970s. Certainly it 
looks much richer than Japan looked back then, at the time of the a€oeNixon ShockaCD that triggered

is instead, building Authoritarian State Surveillance Capitalism with Egalitarian Aspirations
In this task, the Chinese government thinks:

* It has absolutely nothing to learn from the United Statesa€”as GFC, Great Recession, anemic 
recovery, Trump, disinformation epidemic, coronavirus shows. The United States is a society in 
decline, living off of accumulated capital

* It controls the most magnificent and profitable export machine the world has ever seen. But the 
purpose of the export machine is not profita€”not to maximize profit by Chinaa€™ s slotting itself 
into the export-machine slot in the global division of labor

* The purpose of the export machine, rather, is to gain access to technology from value-chain 
partners and to gain worker and engineering experience to attain technological parity

* From that point, the CCP thinks, Chinaa€™ s societal superioritya€’’plus its sheer size in an 
increasing-returns world, plus the CCPa€™ s ability to mobilize resoruces for investment, plus the 
focus of global-north companies and governments on the short run and short-run profits onlya€”will 
lead in a generation to Chinese technological supremacy
And after that, the CCP will lead humanity forward into the sunlit uplands of utopia. What form 
will that a€ceutopiaa€D take in the eyes of Xi Jinping and his successors?

* It will be a more egalitarian society than China today

* But it will still be under tight control from the CCP

* The CCP will need to control personnel and propaganda so that:

* Egalitarian norms are respected and encourageda€’’perhaps there will be oligarchs and plutocrats, 
but they will be kept in their place and allowed by the party to flourish only as long as their 
enterprises are useful and focused, and as they recognize that they are servants of the party, and 
not independent powerbrokers

* Policy remains technocratica€”no botches like the global northa€™ s failed handling of COVID-19, 
or of the Great Recession

* Technological progress remains rapid.

And, most important of all, in Xi Jinpinga€™ s eyes, the CCP can only be the vanguard of humanity 
if the CCP is more than a bunch of corrupt bureaucrats uneasily sitting atop the pyramid of 
society. Hence the need to use propaganda to create centralized campaigns of inspirationa€”to focus 
effort on national economic uplift, to continually recall the CCP to its egalitarian, utopian 
origins, and to keep the members of the CCP conscious that they are a unified
force rather than a collection of people who have climbed to the top of a bureaucratic heap so that 
they can give a handup to their familial and patronage networks. Avoiding the downfall into 
complacency and decadence will be very difficult. To do so needs tight central control of personnel 
and promotion from the center, and needs commitment by the center not to a comfortable bureaucratic 
lifea€”not to late-Brezhnevisma€”but rather to the revolutionary
utopian transformation of humanity.

And, of course, it is most important of all to firmly repress those who seek to remove the CCP from 
its vanguard rolea€”that way lies decadence and incompetence, like the United States today. Nobody 
in China would want to see a Donald Trump in the place where Xi Jinping is now. So far it is going 
well: the CCP treated a great many of its finest cadres very cruelly during the Cultural 
Revolution, yet the thought that the party was at faulta€’’rather than, say,
the Gang of Foura€”is firmly repressed, apparently even among the victims.

It could work: China and the CCP handled the Tienenman Square protest crisis of 1990, 
reform-restart in 1992,1998,2008, & 2020: it is effective and powerful. As long as the General 
Secretary remains minimally corrupt, key personnel decisions will put people who share the General 
Secretariate™ s vision in the driversa€™ seats. And, as I said before, nobody in China wants China 
to become more like America any morea€”COVID, Trump, the Great
Recession, and so forth put an end to any such aspirations

But I do not think that it is likely to worka€”at least not the way that Xi Jinping and his faction 
hope. I see a grave succession problem as the emperor ages. I see the control and information 
problems that always beset overplanninga€”and, no, near-ubiquitous surveillance will not help. I 
see a very powerful incentivization problem as well. When power controls and can threaten wealth, 
those who would otherwise be entrepreneurial will become focused on
acquring power which can protect itself rather than wealth which cannot, and growth will slow.

Plus the Chinese government thinks that it needs to be visibly eeking a a€oeplace in the 
suna€Da€’’perhaps to give the IB in a€oePoor Chinaa€D a feeling that they are winners too from 
Chinaa€™ s growth and power. But as pre-WWI Germany found, such growth provokes reactions. Disputes 
can turn into cold wars, and cold wars can get hot. Plus China may not recognize the degree to 
which the unweaponized interdependence between the U.S., Japan,
South Korea, & Taiwan means that the U.S. a€oevital interestsa€D security perimeter runs through 
the Taiwan Strait and along the 38th Parellel. The chances of major miscalculation are much too

country-sized power on its own. And then are 1.3B people outside the growth poles who can be

to growth. Plus the scale of ChinaS™ s domestic market, should the poorer regions of China with

utopian transformation of humanity.

And, of course, it is most important of all to firmly repress those who seek to remove the CCP from 
its vanguard rolea€”that way lies decadence and incompetence, like the United States today. Nobody 
in China would want to see a Donald Trump in the place where Xi Jinping is now. So far it is going 
well: the CCP treated a great many of its finest cadres very cruelly during the Cultural 
Revolution, yet the thought that the party was at faulta€’’rather than, say,
the Gang of Foura€”is firmly repressed, apparently even among the victims.

It could work: China and the CCP handled the Tienenman Square protest crisis of 1990, 
reform-restart in 1992,1998,2008, & 2020: it is effective and powerful. As long as the General 
Secretary remains minimally corrupt, key personnel decisions will put people who share the General 
Secretariate™ s vision in the driversa€™ seats. And, as I said before, nobody in China wants China 
to become more like America any morea€”COVID, Trump, the Great
Recession, and so forth put an end to any such aspirations

But I do not think that it is likely to worka€”at least not the way that Xi Jinping and his faction 
hope. I see a grave succession problem as the emperor ages. I see the control and information 
problems that always beset overplanninga€”and, no, near-ubiquitous surveillance will not help. I 
see a very powerful incentivization problem as well. When power controls and can threaten wealth, 
those who would otherwise be entrepreneurial will become focused on
acquring power which can protect itself rather than wealth which cannot, and growth will slow.

Plus the Chinese government thinks that it needs to be visibly eeking a a€oeplace in the 
suna€Da€’’perhaps to give the IB in a€oePoor ChinaaCD a feeling that they are winners too from 
Chinaa€™ s growth and power. But as pre-WWI Germany found, such growth provokes reactions. Disputes 
can turn into cold wars, and cold wars can get hot. Plus China may not recognize the degree to 
which the unweaponized interdependence between the U.S., Japan,
South Korea, & Taiwan means that the U.S. a€oevital interestsa€n security perimeter runs through 
the Taiwan Strait and along the 38th Parellel. The chances of major miscalculation are much too 
high.

On the other hand: There are 60M people in the a€oegrowth polesa€D. That is a European 
country-sized power on its own. And then are 1.3B people outside the growth poles who can be
