And much more of an economy in which demand pressure ran into bottlenecks and showed up in rising prices rather than rising employment last summer than I had thought or than the numbers I was then seeing validated.</p><p>And yet the whole round trip seems to leave us right now where I thought we were: still leaving rubber on the road as we rejoin the highway at speed, with the dominant feature of the situation being that we are rejoining the highway at speed and should be incredibly pleased at succeeding in doing so. Thus the most productive position for macroeconomic policy to take is to make sure we do rejoin the highway at speed, and accept that the rubber we are currently leaving on the road as we do so is a necessary side-effect of a very good thing—not something to worry about <em>right now</em>.</p><p>The time to worry about inflation will be next year, when we are moving with the traffic. Then will be the time to look at the situation, look at the bond market’s inflation expectations, and decide whether any sort of monetary policy régime reset is called for.</p><p>If there is an argument that I am wrong, please tell me.

Spellman College <em>magna cum laude</em>, a junior year abroad in Strasbourg, Truman Scholar, Oxford PPE, an M.A. from Université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar, Ph.D. from Berkeley with a dissertation on credit markets in Russia, Assistant Professor at Harvard’s Kennedy School, Senior Advisor on Finance and Development to the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, three years at the Hoover Institution, Senior Economist at the Council of Economic Advisors as, among other things, the point person on the Eurozone-crisis phase of the Great Recession, MSU Professor, Deputy Team Lead for Finance on the Biden-Harris transition.</p><p>From my perspective, her big economic research hits are “The Green Books and the Geography of Segregation in Public Accommodations”, “Rural Segregation and Racial Violence: Historical Effects of Spatial Racism,” “A Green Light for Red Patents: New Evidence from Soviet Innovation Abroad, 1933 to 1991,” “Violence and Economic Growth: Evidence from African American Patents, 1870-1940,” “Overcoming Discrimination by Consumers during the Age of Segregation: The Example of Garrett Morgan,”  “Inventing Social Capital: Evidence from African American Inventors, 1843-1930,” Explorations in Economic History,” and “Metals or Management? Explaining Recent Economic Growth in Africa”. None of these were easy to write: they all involve a huge amount of data-intensive gruntwork, as opposed to turning on the computer, feeding it a bunch of numbers, and then printing out pretty graphs.</p><p>Perhaps most interesting of the things that she has written from the perspective of the waves of garbage that have landed on Lisa Cook this week is her 2004 “The Next Battleground in the Terror War” &lt;<a href="https://www.hoover.org/research/next-battleground-terror-warhttps://www.hoover.org/research/next-battleground-terror-war">https://www.hoover.org/research/next-battleground-terror-warhttps://www.hoover.org/research/next-battleground-terror-war</a>&gt;, from 2004, that she wrote for the Hoover Institution:</p><blockquote><p>The war on terror has not been won in Africa…. Bringing stability to countries is one thing, but making democracy work in them is quite another…. Underdeveloped and dysfunctional economies breed poverty and are prime breeding grounds for terrorists…. The Bush administration has extended and promoted programs such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act…. The schedule for making more manufactured products from Africa available to American consumers needs to be speeded up… the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA)….  HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases are having a devastating effect…. Finally, all the aforementioned peace talks and agreements encouraged and supported by the administration are fragile…. Terrorism bred in distant failed states can eventually make its way back to us and to our allies. It is time to take Africa’s problems seriously…</p></blockquote><p>I read this, and I think: if there still were a Jack Kemp wing of the Republican Party, I really could see Lisa Cook either in it or as a valued centrist partner of it. I can see the George W. Bush African-engagement policy group enthusiastically embracing Lisa Cook as well. </p><p>But in the modern American Republican Party and conservative movement, there is absolutely nothing any African-American can do to gain approval—other than to let themselves be slotted into the role of an enthusiastic denouncer of "wokeness" in all of its forms. A John McWhorter can gain… not approval and respect, for that is beyond possibility, but a certain tolerance… with things like his <em>Woke Racism: How a New Religion Has Betrayed Black America</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Woke-Racism-Religion-Betrayed-America-ebook/dp/B095JLK96B">https://www.amazon.com/Woke-Racism-Religion-Betrayed-America-ebook/dp/B095JLK96B</a>&gt;. </p><p>Short of that, however, nothing else will gain you respect, or anything other than furious denunciations that, whatever you have managed to wrestle out of American society, it is much more than you deserve.</p>
