But do note that Biden has consistently portrayed his major initiatives as sensible and common sense. It is the Republicans who are pretending that they are radical-left initiatives, and making them of partisan salience. All Democrats can do is to beg McCarthy, McConnell, Murdoch, and the other grifters to limit their culture war grifting to unimportant symbolic issues, and let the business of government operate as the business of government should. But experience tells us that does not work. <em>ObamaCare is RomneyCare, after all. </em>But, yes, instead of making everything a culture-war battlefield, today not everything is a culture-war battlefield. Perhaps McCarthy and McConnell have told Murdoch and company to cool it on normal business? It is not clear to me what is going on:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Matthew Yglesias</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Rise &amp; Importance of Secret Congress</em>: ‘In the final two years of the Obama administration… we suddenly—with little fanfare but large bipartisan majorities — got: The Every Student Succeeds Act, a major rewrite of federal K–12 policy; An overhaul of the Department of Veterans Affairs, spearheaded by Bernie Sanders and John McCain; The FAST Act, which authorized $305 billion over five years in infrastructure spending; A ban on incorporating plastic microbeads into health and beauty products…. Biden has only been in office six months…. But along with the water bill he’s also signed the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act, and the Senate passed the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021—formerly known as the Endless Frontiers Act.… </p><p>The core of the Secret Congress theory is that on highly salient issues… polarization is high and compromise is rare. Congress is prone to gridlock…. Members of the minority (rightly) think that any popular, well-known bill that passes on a bipartisan basis is going to help the standing of the president…. In an era where congressional voting is so highly correlated with presidential approval, and primary electorates say they’d rather have members that fight the other party than help their own state, it’s extremely risky for a member of Congress to let an opposite-party president be seen as successful…. </p><p>But… no Republican congressman is going to be primaried for voting for the low-salience Endless Frontiers Act, because it doesn’t count as “giving Biden a win”…. While our representatives are grandstanding in front of the cameras, they’re also hammering out compromises on low-profile issues…. </p><p>The most important implication is that if you don’t have the votes to steamroll the opposition, avoid making your issue coded as highly partisan. Don’t frame your issue as a “win” for your party; talk about it as a common-sense reform. Do the work of trying to find and convince people across the ideological spectrum that it’s a good idea and that it’s in their interest to support it. You should also pay attention to substance rather than labels. The energy bill that passed late last year is a very significant injection of funding into zero-carbon energy research and deployment. But it wasn’t coded as a “climate bill,” and it’s certainly not the “Green New Deal”…</p><p>And as we saw with the Endless Frontiers Act, the final product is going to be deformed somewhat by the picayune priorities of members of Congress rather than reflecting the pure vision of a technocrat or ideologue. But that’s how it’s basically always been in America, and we’ve somehow muddled through okay…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-rise-and-importance-of-secret">https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-rise-and-importance-of-secret</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-06-21-mo?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-06-21-mo?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>AC-DC</strong>: <em>Highway to Hell</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l482T0yNkeo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l482T0yNkeo</a>&gt;:</p><div id="youtube2-l482T0yNkeo" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;l482T0yNkeo&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l482T0yNkeo?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Quinn Cummings</strong>: _’I was in my mid-thirties before I realized I have face blindness.

When we look back at 1950–2000, we will see it as pre-internet or pre-software-defined-business era. Much time was spent taking tech and applying it to the hard parts of running businesses that were doing what had been done inefficiently, at local scale (e.g., accounting and logistics). But those difficult parts were the problems defined by 1900–1950, the problems of figuring out just how to design, assemble, and distribute goods. Technology was applied to “automate” or “make efficient” those problems. It has been incredible. The disruption that took place was “scale”—corporations brought capabilities to make and distribute things globally, in a newly global market…. The first 25 years of internet, in hindsight, were an era of “connecting” those innovations…. Walmart took computers and software and turned the elaborate processes of selecting merchandise, distributing it, monitoring sales, and so on and automated it per store. Amazon built one giant store with everything…. That is what disruption looks like….</p><p>The debate over remote work vs hybrid vs HQ is only part of the picture…. PC people set out to solve information and programming problems not “how do you do reliability of OS 370 card readers”. In going after the same target (“accounting”) with new architecture, whole new economics and solutions appeared…. It is said the pandemic pulled forward a decade or more of “digital transformation”. Yes. But what it really is going to be is the equivalent of what WWII did to the corporation or the microprocessor to mainframe. The question is not “work remotely”, but what is the very structure of getting things done? We can’t see it now, but in 25 years corporations will run very differently. They will not be 3/5’s HQ with everything the same. Why and how?…. This is what disruption looks like. It happens slowly at first, then very quickly. It seems impossible to imagine a different way to do things, then we’re doing things in a different way. Stay tuned for a whole new way to work…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://a16z.com/2021/06/12/disruption-at-work-its-more-than-just-wfh/">https://a16z.com/2021/06/12/disruption-at-work-its-more-than-just-wfh/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p><em>Freddie from Barmen</em>: 175 years ago Friedrich Engels put his finger on the major flaw in economics that Paul Romer has tried to repair over his career:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Friedrich Engels (1843): Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy: "According to the economists, the production costs of a commodity consist of three elements: the rent for the piece of land required to produce the raw material; the capital with its profit, and the wages for the labour required for production and manufacture…. A third factor which the economist does not think about–I mean the mental element of invention, of thought alongside the physical element of sheer labour. What has the economist to do with inventiveness? Have not all inventions fallen into his lap without any effort on his part? Has one of them cost him anything? Why then should he bother about them in the calculation of production costs? Land, capital and labour are for him the conditions of wealth, and he requires nothing else. Science is no concern of his.</p><p>What does it matter to him that he has received its gifts through Berthollet, Davy, Liebig, Watt, Cartwright, etc.–gifts which have benefited him and his production immeasurably? He does not know how to calculate such things; the advances of science go beyond his figures. But in a rational order which has gone beyond the division of interests as it is found with the economist, the mental element certainly belongs among the elements of production and will find its place, too, in economics among the costs of production. And here it is certainly gratifying to know that the promotion of science also brings its material reward; to know that a single achievement of science like James Watt’s steam-engine has brought in more for the world in the first fifty years of its existence than the world has spent on the promotion of science since the beginning of time…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.bradford-delong.com/2018/11/friedrich-engels-1843-_outlines-of-a-critique-of-political-economyhttpswwwmarxistsorgarchivemarxworks1844-1.html">https://www.bradford-delong.com/2018/11/friedrich-engels-1843-_outlines-of-a-critique-of-political-economyhttpswwwmarxistsorgarchivemarxworks1844-1.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>The two plague years have given very many people who were not aficionados of online information a great deal of experience in dealing with it—especially in dealing with the short run gifts that are very, very obvious: people wanting your credit card number to give you a refund, and such.
