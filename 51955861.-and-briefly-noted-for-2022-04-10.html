And it is a thing that me, playing my position, should take note of:</p><p>Barry Eichengreen:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Barry Eichengreen</strong>: <em>Europe’s Economy on a Knife Edge</em>: ‘Before Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine, Europe’s recovery from the damage wrought by the COVID–19 pandemic was solidifying…. But then the war dented consumer confidence by heightening uncertainty and raising energy and commodity prices…. More costly energy will no doubt be a drag on growth. But if Russian gas continues to flow, higher prices will not bake in a recession…. But using less gas is one thing; using none at all is quite another. In the latter scenario, gas-powered factories won’t be economizing; they will be shutting down…. Whether gas supplies are suspended depends entirely on Putin, who could decide to terminate shipments in retaliation against Western sanctions. He may need the revenues, but this would not be the first time that anger and pride trumped economic logic. If the West makes payments not to Gazprombank but into escrow accounts, Putin will lose his last remaining incentive to keep the gas flowing…. If Putin allows his army to continue committing atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, Western European publics and policymakers will unite against him. Given their country’s history, Germans will not be able to sit back comfortably, in homes heated by Russian gas….</p><p>It is easy for an American, heated by natural gas from Texas and the Dakotas, to say that Europe should endure a recession in order to ratchet up the pressure on Putin. But if President Joe Biden’s administration and the US Congress think it crucial to intensify the pressure on Russia, then they can make it worth Europe’s while. Europe will take the lead in Ukraine’s postwar reconstruction. The logistics are easier…. But if Europe is the logical party to do the legwork and administer the aid, then the United States can provide the bulk of the finance, beyond that portion financed by escrow accounts and Russia’s other external assets. This will be an appropriate humanitarian gesture once the war is over. But a US commitment now to compensate Europe for the steps it must take, starting with a ban on imports of Russian oil and gas, is also a way to incentivize it to help bring the war to an early end…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-economic-growth-depends-on-putin-by-barry-eichengreen-2022-04">https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-economic-growth-depends-on-putin-by-barry-eichengreen-2022-04</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>I endorse this from Barry-down-the-hall 100%. Ukrainian reconstruction should be financed 100% out of Russia’s seized external assets, and then by the United States. Europeans should start paying for Russian gas into escrow accounts on which Ukraine reconstruction has a lien. Given the pictures and videos that have come out and will come out of Ukraine, and given the willingness of European voters to look at them in a way they would not look at pictures from Syria or Grozny, there is a very high probability that European politicians will ultimately be forced to act. It is much better for them to take control of the action now rather than to be reduced to the position of mid-1800s French politician André Ledru-Rollin: “There go my people! And I must follow them, for I am their leader!”</p><p>Those steps taken now should greatly concentrate the minds of Putin’s circle about the need to bring a war that Russia will be paying for both sides of to a rapid end. But Putin himself needs a line of retreat. The line of retreat I would offer him would be a Second Yalta Conference: International recognition of the redrawing of borders to place Crimea, Lohan's, and Donetsk on the Russian side; in return, immediate Ukraine accession to the EU and to NATO, plus Russian assets paying for Ukraine reconstruction (but not subsequent development); and the US funding a Marshall Plan for Ukraine.</p><p>Such a second Yalta conference will be generally condemned in a generation as a betrayal of the people living in Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk. And it will be rightly so condemned.</p><p>But I think it may well be the best thing we can do, given the situation. </p><p>One does not, after all, walk into a negotiation with a crazy man controlling nuclear weapons and expect roses and unicorns and rainbows.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/-and-briefly-noted-for-2022-04-10?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading—and please share with someone you think would learn from this…</p></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/-and-briefly-noted-for-2022-04-10?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/-and-briefly-noted-for-2022-04-10?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p></div><div><hr></div><h2>Some Pictures:</h2><p><strong>Dan Jones</strong>: <em>Apocalypse Wow</em>: ‘A giant tapestry in the Château d’Angers tells the story of the end of the world….

I study the first modern global banking crisis originating in London in 1866 and collect archival loan records that link multinational banks headquartered there to their lending abroad. Countries exposed to bank failures in London immediately exported significantly less and did not recover their lost growth relative to unexposed places. Their market shares within each destination also remained significantly lower for four decades. Decomposing the persistent market-share losses shows that they primarily stem from lack of extensive-margin growth, as the financing shock caused importers to source more from new trade partnerships. Exporters producing more substitutable goods, those with little access to alternative forms of credit, and those trading with more distant partners experienced more persistent losses, consistent with the existence of sunk costs and the importance of finance for intermediating trade…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/qje/qjac016/6563147">https://academic.oup.com/qje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/qje/qjac016/6563147</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>I think this is, flatly, wrong. The key question is whether a liberal-democratic order will in the end be more durable and more attractive to those who wield social power, both over material resources and over the means of persuading others, then an authoritarian-plutocratic order. I used to be confident that it would be. I thought the means of persuasion were limited in their efficacy. I thought that plutocrats would recognize that kleptocrats are not their allies, but rather predators to be feared. I thought they would conclude that it it was better to allow the moderation of autocracy in order to gain the protection offered by liberal society.

Fukuyama has also been willing to, as he put it in a recent essay, “stick [his] neck out” over the likely geopolitical consequences of the war in Ukraine. Chief among his predictions: Russia will lose the war, perhaps spectacularly, and this defeat will help the West get out of “our funk about the declining state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, thanks to a bunch of brave Ukrainians.” For those interested in the stability of the international order, it’s an optimistic, even reassuring, vision of the war’s potential outcome…. His “ultimate nightmare”, he said, is a world in which China and Russia work in harness with one another, perhaps with China bolstering Russia’s war and Beijing launching its own invasion—of Taiwan. If that were to happen, and be successful, Fukuyama said, “then you would really be living in a world that was being dominated by these non-democratic powers. If the United States and the rest of the West couldn’t stop that from happening, then that really is the end of the end of history”…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/encounter/2022/03/francis-fukuyama-on-the-end-of-the-end-of-history">https://www.newstatesman.com/encounter/2022/03/francis-fukuyama-on-the-end-of-the-end-of-history</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Put a tickler here that I need to return to this. There is an awful lot here, and I need to decide what to think about it:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Noah Smith</strong>: <em>Five Reasons China’s Productivity [Growth] Slowed Down</em>: ‘Productivity growth is the thread that ties together the entire story of the Chinese economy since 2008. Basic economic theory says that eventually the growth benefits of capital accumulation hit a wall, and you have to improve technology and/or efficiency to keep growth going. Some countries, like Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, have done this successfully, and are now rich; other, like Thailand, failed to do it…. For several decades, Chinese productivity growth looked like Japan’s or Korea’s…. But slightly before Xi came to power, it downshifted to look a bit more like Thailand…. The question then becomes: Why has Chinese productivity growth slowed to a crawl?… </p><p>Tailwinds…. As you reach the frontier, the remaining technologies you need to absorb to keep growing productivity quickly become more and more complicated…. Demographics…. China began to age rapidly  right around 2010…. Rapid urbanization… raises productivity a lot…. So in the last decade, three big tailwinds that were driving Chinese productivity growth probably dried up. And there’s not really anything that Xi Jinping or any leader can do about that. </p><p>But there are probably other factors dragging down China’s productivity growth as well, that might be more amenable to policy fixes. Low research productivity…. Unfortunately, research input doesn’t always lead to research output…. Zhang, Zhang &amp; Zhao…. Misallocation of resources…. A lot of this spending is being done by state-owned companies that are just throwing money at “research” because the government tells them to…. Limited export markets…. I’m a big fan of… the idea of “export discipline”…. A shift from export-led growth to growth led by domestic investment…. If [there are] productivity benefits from exporting, then this is also a challenge for long-term growth…. </p><p>Not enough consumption…. Consumers have a preference for differentiated goods that spurs companies to develop new products, increase quality, offer new features, and so on…. Over the past decade, China has been building a lot of buildings and a lot of infrastructure…. </p><p>In the last three years, Xi has undertaken a second, more destructive effort to reshape China’s industrial landscape. Instead of simply boosting the industries he wants, he has attacked the industries he doesn’t want…. An economy where the leader is always smashing companies and industries he doesn’t like is inherently an economy full of risk. Yes, Chinese engineers and managers will obey Xi’s will and go into the industries he wants them to go into. But the loss of entrepreneurship and initiative might make this a pyrrhic victory. In other words, escaping China’s low-productivity-growth trap is going to be tough, and Xi’s strategy doesn’t fill me with a ton of confidence…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:51604882,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/five-reasons-chinas-productivity&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:35345,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Noahpinion&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/04281755-2cd6-42e5-a496-e69153abebb2_281x281.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Five reasons China's productivity slowed down&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;It’s always an interesting experience to read books about China’s economy from before 2018 or so.

Liberalism requires rough equality of social power to be any good, yes—which means a great narrowing of economic disparities. Democracy is almost surely much better than not-democracy. But a democracy that does not respect your liberal rights wherever you find yourself in disagreement with the majority definitely does not advance your human dignity. Does non-liberal leftism turns into a better form of liberalism, rather than an alternative:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Matthew McManus</strong>: <em>A Critical Legal Examination of Liberalism and Liberal Rights</em>: ’This book has two aims. First, to provide a critical legal examination of the liberal state and liberal rights in the law, and secondly, to present a systematic alternative to liberal approaches to both the law and rights, grounded in a left-wing conception of human dignity. At the opening of the 21st century,&nbsp;a remarkable thing happened. Liberalism, once considered the only doctrine left standing at the end of history, began to face renewed&nbsp;competition from both the political left and the post-modern conservative right. This book argues that the way forward is not to abandon, but to radicalize, the potential of the liberal project. Analysing major theoretical positions in order to build a critical genealogy of liberal rights, McManus lucidly develops a left-wing alternative to the classic liberal approach to rights drawing on the traditions of liberal egalitarians and deliberative democracy theory. &nbsp;Societies, he argues, should be committed to advancing the human dignity of all through the enshrinement of certain rights into positive state law, the expansion of&nbsp;democracy, and a resolute commitment to economic equality…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Examination-Liberalism-Palgrave-Classical-ebook-dp-B08P2SPDT1/dp/B08P2SPDT1/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=">https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Examination-Liberalism-Palgrave-Classical-ebook-dp-B08P2SPDT1/dp/B08P2SPDT1/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p></p><div><hr></div><p>I am midway through <em>Aspects</em>, and I am finding reading it incredibly delightful.
