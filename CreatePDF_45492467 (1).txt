Arthur Eckstein (2006): Mediterranean Anarchy, Interstate War, & the Rise of Rome (Berkeley: 
University of California Press): a€~The fundamental question is not why Roman society was 
militaristic and often at war, but why the Roman city-state was able to create a very large and 
durable territorial polity when so many other city-states failed at
that taska€!. It is not stern militarism but Romea€™ s ability to assimilate outsiders and to 
create a large and stable territorial hegemony that makes Rome stand out from other city-states. 
The norm in the ancient world was that large territorial states were created by kingsa€!. Yet the 
premodern territorial states created by kingsa€! were themselves
inherently fragilea€! rest[ing] primarily upon the personal capabilities of the individual 
rulersa€!. Here, too, Rome was exceptionala€! not primarily the work of single titanic 
personalities, nora€! as fragile asa€! dynastic empiresa€!.

To understand the Roman ability to integratea€! one starts from the fact that the societies of 
central Italy were more open to immigration^!. Commercium, conubium, and migratioaQ. Two 
caaceptea^y municipium and civitas sine suffragioa€.’’dominated the Roman decisions after the Latin 
Wara€! Rome would have available the fighting power of the
Latin[s]a€! if they could be controlled and conciliateda€!. As a result of the reorganization of 
the 330sa€! Rome became the largest city-state in the ancient world in terms of citizen 
populationa€L The Roman development of an idea of citizenship divorced from ethnicity and/or 
geographic locationa€!. This gave Rome the exceptional advantages in
scale of resourcesa€! against large but fragile dynastic empires, or against small and hence 
limited city-states or mere tribal groupingsa€!.

From those exceptional advantagesa€! hegemony emergeda€!. [Rome had an] intensely militaristic 
culturea€! constantly expanding definition of securitya€! increasingly large ambitions. Rome was 
indeed like thisa€!. Buta€! most ancient statesa€! were also like thisa€!. What, then, explains 
Romea€™ s exceptional success? Most ancient states were
also fragilea€”even if powerfula€!. Romea€! after -338 simply did not suffer from the 
fragilitiesa€!. It is thisa€! that permitted Rome not merely to survive in its exceptionally harsh 
environment but to prevail over ita€!

Rome after 340-338 replaced ethnicity and geographical location as the basis of membership in the 
polity with a ladder of legal status-groups not tied to eithera€!. non-Roman allies (the socii), 
halfway citizens (the cives sine suffagio), full citizens (cives)a€\. the Romans werea€! generous 
in allowing non-Roman individuals and even (very
occasionally) whole non-Roman polities to climb up this status hierarchy, Rome gained an enhanced 
capacity to win loyaltya€!. The capacity for inclusion and integration^!. The rewards Rome was 
culturally and politically capable of dispensinga€! local peacea€! [and] the inclusion of local 
elites in the Roman state were much greater than any state
in   Greece could ever offera€!. It was the system of inclusion, which was ultimately a diplomatic 
and political skilla€! that made Rome potentially the most powerful state in the ancient 
Mediterranean^!
