George Orwell is very strong on the side that there is only one. And, in spite of himself, post-World War II English Marxist historian E.P. Thompson, one of the three great post-WWII English Marxists—Thompson, Hobsbawm, Miliband—is on Orwell’s side of this as well. </p><p>Not, I hasten to say, that Thompson argues on Orwell’s side. Rather, he illustrates and validates it. </p><p>Here he is in the early 1970s, issuing a complaint against Polish ex-Communist Leszek Kolakowski. His major complaint? Not that Kolakowski tells lies about really-existing socialism. It is that Kolakowski tells the truth about it, and because he tells the truth in ways and places that Thompson thinks he should not, he commits unforgivable sins: the sin against the Holy Ghost. But when did Thompson think you should tell the truth? At the time he wrote his <em>Open Letter to Leszek Kolakowski</em>, the answer was “nowhere and nowhen”:</p><blockquote><p><strong>E.P. Thompson</strong> (1973): <em>An Open Letter to Leszek Kolakowski</em>: ‘My criticisms of socialist reality have always been made in socialist journals…. When I can no longer criticize socialism from such an unmistakeable anti-capitalist standpoint, I will fall silent…. No word of mine will wittingly be added to the comforts of that old bitch gone in the teeth, consumer capitalism…. The apologists of capitalism appear with newly-soaped faces, and offer their beast as a beast of changed nature. But I know that that beast is not changed…. </p><p>Capitalist ideology is… a very ancient hegemony… so assured that it can dispense with many of the more vulgar institutional means of imposing orthodoxy…. Even the role of the Jester, which is a role you chose for yourself in the East, is a role which must be played with discretion. For the jester, if he jests in all company and jests unwisely, may provide arguments which acquire a different meaning when employed by the subalterns of the Emperor…. </p><p>Films… of revolutionary disenchantment… [were] first made in about 1792…. A powerful version was made in the 1930s and it has been running to packed houses ever since. The reactive pattern, by which disenchantment in revolutionary aspirations leads on, after creative difficulties and conflicts, to ultimate reconciliation with the pre-existent status quo—or even zealous ideological partisanship on behalf of the status quo—is deeply inscribed within western culture. And it has, within capitalist ideology today, a very important confirmatory and legitimating function…. </p><p>Your predicament in this respect was anticipated by [Alasdair] MacIntyre as early as 1958: “The reassertion of moral standards by the individual voice has been one of the ferments of Eastern European revisionism…. [But] one cannot revive the moral content within Marxism by simply taking a Stalinist view of historical development and adding liberal morality to it. But however one may disagree with Kolakowski’s theoretical position, the kind of integrity involved in reasserting moral principles in the Polish situation is entirely admirable…. But to assert this position in the West is to flow with the stream. It is merely to conform.”… MacIntyre does less than justice to your thought at that time. But in coming to the West… as you have done, you appear to fulfil a fifteen-year-old prediction…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/thompson-ep/1973/kolakowski.htm">https://www.marxists.org/archive/thompson-ep/1973/kolakowski.htm</a>&gt; [Alasdair MacIntyre, <em>Notes from the Moral Wilderness</em>, I, op. cit., p.93.]</p></blockquote><p>Note that Thompson is not alone. I have elsewhere talked about his peer Eric Hobsbawm. And their peer Ralph Miliband strongly, strongly objected to North Vietnam’s overthrow of the Khmer Rouge and thus the interruption of the Cambodian genocide. Why? Because it washed the movement’s dirty linen in public &lt;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/miliband/1980/xx/intervention.html">https://www.marxists.org/archive/miliband/1980/xx/intervention.html</a>&gt;. In all cases the logic seems to be this: The movement has set a direction, and once that direction has been set the Leader (or the Leadership) must not be questioned, for the most important thing is for the Party to present a unified, united phalanx to the outside world.</p><p>It is because of this attraction of follow-our-leader-right-or-wrong-and-especially-when-wrong that I come down mostly on the side of only one totalitarianism: a doctrine that claimed that the fatal flaw in liberal capitalist democracy was that it did not understand that people needed to be led by a leader or leader. The sources of the leader or leaders’ legitimacy differed: either an insight into the laws of historical materialism and its plan for humanity or a charisma that enabled the setting of nationalist, communitarian, and ethnic power-goals that gave meaning to the life of the leader or leaders’ subjects. But, still, the same-old same-old.</p><p>Later on, as of 1978, Thompson did somewhat change his mind, and would cry out “does the suppression of reason, and the obliteration of the imagination, have any place on ‘the Left’?”—without seeming to notice that he had been eager to deploy that slogan against the washing of really-existing socialism’s linen in public as late as 1973 &lt;<a

The Fed must now do two things quickly. CAMBRIDGE – It took way too long, but key officials at the US Federal Reserve have finally acknowledged that for months they mischaracterized an inflationary surge that has proven larger and more persistent than they expected. That recognition is welcome, especially given the likelihood that inflation will remain uncomfortably high in the coming months. The challenge now, not just for the Fed but also more broadly for the United States and other major economies, is to navigate a policy terrain in which communication and implementation have been rendered significantly more complex by a fundamental misreading of inflation as “transitory”…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-federal-reserve-transitory-inflation-trap-by-mohamed-a-el-erian-2021-12">https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-federal-reserve-transitory-inflation-trap-by-mohamed-a-el-erian-2021-12</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Michael Hiltzik</strong>: <em>Why Do We Fear Inflation?</em>: ‘There’s a right way and a wrong way to think about inflation.

After days of online vitriol (and support), the dust has settled a bit, and it’s worth reflecting a bit on what they did and why it mattered…. There are a few things you should notice. First, Fox is the 800-pound gorilla of conservative media. Unlike the more competitive environment in legacy media, where no single outlet comes close to comparable dominance, Fox isn’t just first, it’s first by a mile…. Second, look at who’s surging. Fox is in a state of very modest decline, most other sites are declining at a much faster rate, but the two outlets making dramatic gains—the Epoch Times and Newsmax—are, if anything, more aggressive than Fox.&nbsp;Third, look at the utterly dreadful quality of many of the outlets on the list…. And of course Fox doesn’t just dominate online, it dominates on television…. Fox is conservative media, and almost everything that is not Fox is some variation on the Fox product…. I’m reminded of the awesome power of Rush Limbaugh during his early rise…. New right-wing voices are often engaged in a de facto audition for that coveted Fox airtime. That reality, combined with Fox’s own aggressive defense of its brand, is one reason why so very little right-wing “media criticism” is aimed at the largest, most powerful, and most profitable cable network in the land. Fox broadcasts Seth Rich conspiracies? Memory-holed. Fox gave airtime to Kraken lawyers? Well, they were just asking questions. Its streaming platform airs a deranged Patriot Purge documentary that re-imagines the reality of January 6? Nobody watches Fox Nation anyway…. Look again at the list of the top 20 conservative outlets. How many reliably highlight Fox’s errors unless they’re attempting to scrape off part of their pro-Trump market share?… The cultural and political consequences in the right-wing grassroots are considerable…. Activists don’t know what they don’t know in part because telling them the truth in right-wing spaces carries a cost—and not just in reader disapproval. Fox, the most potent player in the market, will be displeased, and when it is displeased the ceiling on your career gets a little bit lower. And who needs that? After all, why focus on Fox? I’m sure the Washington Post has screwed something up.
