1870 GDP per Work Hour

FIGURE 2. PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH RATE, 1870-1979 vs. 1870 LEVEL

These notebook assignments are a required part of the course.

Collaborating on the notebooks is more than okaya€”it is encouraged! Seek help from a classmate or 
an instructor or a roommate or a passerby when you get stuck! (Explaining things is beneficial, 
tooa€”the best way to solidify your
knowledge of a subject is to explain it.)

But the work should be your own.

No cutting-&-pasting from othersaC™ notebooks, please! We want you to learn this stuff, and your 
fingers typing every keystroke is an important way of building muscle memory here.

In this notebook, you will attempt to assess to what degree countries that were well-positioned, 
economically, poiltically, culturally, educationally, and technologically, to a€ceconvergea€D to 
the standards of living and productivity
levels of the United States in 1870 have done soa€”or, rather, had done so as of 1979.

Neoclassical and neoliberal economists believe they have a strong theoretical argument that there 
should be a€ceconvergencea€D of economies. The first, less important, part is that economies should 
converge in their savings­
investment rates and in their population and labor force growth rates and thus in their capital 
intensity levels. More importanta€”so the theoretical argument goesa€”is convergence in the level 
of technology deployed. Development is
easier   than discovery, and deployment is easier than development. Discovery must take place, 
overwhelmingly, in the leading edge growth poles of the world economy. But development can take 
place in any of a wide range of places
with sufficiently developed communities of engineering practice. And deployment can take place 
anywhere that people are literate, experienced with the use of modern technology, and confident 
that their effort at deploying technologies
in production will be satisfactorily rewarded. Once, therefore, countriesa€™ economies have 
developed sufficient degrees of literacy and sufficiently strong communities of engineering 
practice to begin to transfer technology from
abroad and deploy it in their economiesa€”once they have made what Walt Rostow used to analogize as 
the a€oetakeoffa€n into self-sustained growth, a€ceconvergencea€D should follow. That, at any 
event, is the theory.

Back in 1986 Will Baumol: Productivity, Convergence, & Welfare: What Does the Long-Run Data Show? 
<http://pikettv.pse.ens.fr/files/Baumol1986.pdf> argued that the history since 1870 showed that 
this had in fact happened.
I disagreed.

Was I right?
