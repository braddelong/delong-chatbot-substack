That is enough to get inflation expectations up to the Fed’s target of 2.5%/year on a CPI basis. That is not enough for anyone reasonable to claim that an ever-upward inflationary spiral is on the way. The definition of “stagflation” is a world in which expectations are anchored on the belief that inflation is going to rise over time, hence an unemployment rate greater than the natural rate is required in order to hold inflation steady. That does not seem to be the world we are headed for in the optimistic scenario. And that stagflation equilibrium is much further away in the non-optimistic scenarios:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Laurence Ball &amp;&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>al.</strong></em>:&nbsp;<em>US Inflation: Set for Take-Off?</em>: ’How high is the ongoing US fiscal expansion likely to push inflation? This column presents new evidence that underlying (weighted median) CPI&nbsp;inflation has so far steadily declined since the start of the COVID–19 crisis, broadly as predicted by its historical Phillips curve relation. If the ongoing fiscal expansion reduces unemployment to 1.5–3.5%, as some predict, underlying&nbsp;inflation could rise to about 2.5–3% by 2023. If the fiscal expansion is temporary and monetary policy remains clearly communicated and decisive, there is little risk of a 1960s-type inflationary spiral… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://voxeu.org/article/us-inflation-set-take">https://voxeu.org/article/us-inflation-set-take</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-05-09-su?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-05-09-su?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Joseph Michael Newhard</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Stock Market Speaks: How Dr. Alchian Learned to Build the Bomb</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/article-alchian-bomb.pdf">https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/article-alchian-bomb.pdf</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jemima Kelly</strong>:&nbsp;<em>You Can Now Build a “Mini Media Empire” on Substack</em>&lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b9fea53-db83-4cd4-a9bd-10af24aebfea">https://www.ft.com/content/7b9fea53-db83-4cd4-a9bd-10af24aebfea</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Ian Cuttress</strong>:&nbsp;<em>TechTechPotato</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1r0DG-KEPyqOeW6o79PByw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1r0DG-KEPyqOeW6o79PByw</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Nina L.

Zoning reform proposal is… right-wing… let people do what they want with their property… people should decide for themselves…. But the dynamics of identity politics are strong, and Edward Ring in&nbsp;<em>American Greatness</em>&nbsp;tries to make a right-populist take where housing abundance is good but density is also bad…. There’s no reason Texas shouldn’t keep building more homes in the suburbs of Austin.

It might be that, at times when he was more than usually assailed by doubts concerning the future, he would turn in his perplexity towards more consumption and less new investment. But that would avoid the disastrous, cumulative and far-reaching repercussions of its being open to him, when thus assailed by doubts, to spend his income neither on the one nor on the other. Those who have emphasised the social dangers of the hoarding of money have, of course, had something similar to the above in mind.
