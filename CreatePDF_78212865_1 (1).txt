David Chance: REVIEW of a€ceSlouchinga€D at Independent .ie: Nice to see:

David Chance: a€~At 600-plus pagesa€! not for the faint-hearted, but therea€™ s little in the way 
of jargona€! the booked is laced with interesting
anecdotes, although DeLong does get a bit wordya€!a€™

a€oeA bit wordy.a€D Hah! At over 600 pages, it is not a book for a flight from Dublin to Frankfurt 
or a ferry ride to Liverpool. Think a€oetransoceanica€n instead. Slouching
Towards Utopia <bit.ly/3pP3Krk>
