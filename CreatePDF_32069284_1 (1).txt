Julia Carrie Wong: Great reporting on Facebook Groups, Mark Zuckerberga€™ s most blatant effort at 
social engineering which has been supercharging extremism and hate for years

The social network struggled to balance CEO Mark Zuckerberga€™ s mantra of free expression against 
internal findings that misinformation and rabid partisanship had overrun a feature meant to be

James Fallows: This dispatch by @froomkin is full of *so* much important and crucial advice that my 
first instinct was to just screenshot it all. Instead, please read it all!

eporters/a€! h/t @GRobLewis Two samples:

But publishing what anonymous sources say is essentially vouching for their
credibility, because readers have no way of judging it on their own. It also means the
sources can avoid accountability of any kind for what they said, including if they lied.

So new rules:


• No anonymous sourcing unless you and your editor agree that the information is vital to an
important story, otherwise unattainable, and you are either satisfied of your source's altruistic
motives or prepared to describe their more venal ones to your readers.

• Warn them that if they lie to you, you will out them.

I'm also abolishing the fact-checking department. Or rather, I'm turning everyone

into a fact-checker. Fact-checks shouldn't be segregated. If a lie is important, that's a
news story. If an entire political party is engaged in gaslighting, that's a news story.

Even  more  importantly,  we  should  pursue  consequences  for  lying,  because  right  now
there  are  none  beyond  a  "fact  check"  that  nobody  reads.  That  means  interrupting
known  liars  when  they  are  repeating  a  known  lie.  That  means  demanding  retractions,
publicly  and  repeatedly.  That  means  denying  serial  liars  the  opportunity  to  use  the

medi? - p^rtKMlarlY media - to spread their lie?, That mean? whenever YOU_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

quote  a  serial  liar,  even  if  they  are  not  provably  lying  at  the  time,  you  warn  
readers
that  they  lie  a  lot.  That  means  openly  distinguishing  in  your  reporting  between  people
who,  regardless  of  their  political  views,  can  be  counted  on  to  be  acting  in  good  
faith
from those who can be counted on to be acting in bad faith.

INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY

CNN: TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM LEAVES LESS THAN 2 WEEKS BEFORE TRIAL


Josh Marshall: Collins is off her game. If she wanted to Lucy this they'd come in just under $1.5T. 
Biden and Sen Ds would be tempted to engage at that number. (Number hardly matters. You pull the 
football regardless.) $600B makes it easy to say welp, no partner, reconciliation it is.

Paul Krugman: Why, exactly, is bipartisanship something to be valued right now? When a political 
party by and large still won't accept Biden's legitimacy and embraces Jewish space laser people, 
why is it a virtue to cooperate with

Paul Krugman: Also, the major items in the Biden proposal are very popular, generally with >60% 
approval. Why defer to a party that is lockstep opposed to what the public wants? 3/

your initial claim, but nevertheless you persisted by additionally asserting that “one of the people
who organized this is well known for having worked with The Lincoln Project in the past.’*

When Mr. Bannon then asked you to reveal the identity of this *guy working with The
Lincoln Project.** you responded with “I don’t know if 1 can reveal his name, because we have
that                                             from anonymous sources,** Mr. Bannon. realizing 
that you had no evidence to support your
wild accusation, stated •‘You’re killing me... You can’t throw a charge out there like that and
then say ‘Yeah. I got a double secret probation guy who I can’t mention.** Still, you held tight

to your fantastical claim about The Lincoln Project for the remainder of your appearance.'1

You committed a textbook act of defamation. You publicly accused The Lincoln Project
of an infamous and criminal act that it had nothing to do with, as you very well know. You lied.

You have until Wednesday, February 3rd to retract your statement fully and to apologize
publicly to The Lincoln Project. Refuse at your peril. In the meantime, you arc hereby notified
that   you should retain any and all documents, including emails and other electronic files, 
relating
to this matter. You will never again be America’s Mayor, but there may still be time to save
some                                             of the cash that you pawned your credibility for, 
should Dominion Voting Systems
ultimately leave you with any.

mostly I am just devastated that there are so many people in our country who would hate me without 
ever knowing me

Josh Marshall: GOPs are **not** in disarray. No party civil war. They are remarkably united in 
their total support of Trump, Q & the insurrection. The only commotion is punitive missions 
targeting a handful of stragglers who zigged for the constitution when they were supposed to zag 
for Trump.

Dan Davies: in 2008 it was when Sean Keane (laconic Kiwi guy responsible for Credit Suisse's short 
term funding desk) started a daily email that we all clamored to be on, in my memory opening with 
the line "I thought I would see my career out without anyone ever caring what I do ..."

(((Frances *Cassandra* Coppola))): can anyone join in this pile-on, or is it a private party?

Sean Tuffy: Ooh, are we piling on mandatory OTC clearing and the creation of a new breed of 
systemic risk?

Dan Davies: (as Paul Purcell says, it's always the fixed income assholes who spoil the party)

Dan Davies: not sure at this stage; whichever one made the collateral call on Robinhood which 
caused them to restrict accounts. Settlements guys On Here seem to be talking about DTCC. I am not

May I join you?

Dan Davies: not sure at this stage; whichever one made the collateral call on Robinhood which 
caused them to restrict accounts. Settlements guys On Here seem to be talking about DTCC. I am not 
a plumber by trade so I don't do detail on this!

Dan Davies: that would surely suck, but I'd expect the market to take its licking and keep ticking; 
clearing members have failed in the past, the secret is that everyone knows equities are risky, so 
people don't usually lever them up like bonds.

James Meadway: a€oeThe purpose of studying economics is not to acquire a set of ready-made answers 
to economic questions, but to learn how to avoid being deceived by economists .a€D (Robinson, 
rather than Robbins)

Scott cunningham: Professors of economics. What definition of economics do you give on day one? I 
usually use the lionel Robbins one about unlimited wants and limited resources with a second 
definition emphasizing allocations.

Scott Greenberg: Downsides of remote learning: * Much harder to pay attention * Professors are 
unable to read the room * Classroom interaction is more awkward * You're on your screen all day * 
Impossible to know if professor is looking at you * You don't see friends in the hallway between 
classes
