When real upward mobility is hard to find, people are easy prey to grifters:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ed Zitron</strong>: <em>If You’re Not A Skeptic, You’re A Sucker</em>: ‘I recognize that a lot of cryptocurrency fans feel somewhat unworthy of your sympathy… [but] millions of people interact with these chaotic, manipulated, and kleptocratic systems because they feel they have no other choice…. We are throwing regular people into a financial meat grinder in one of the most desperate financial eras in history. Thanks to the years of media attention given to millennial millionaires that have hit it big on crypto, the average person has an illusion of proximity to success, driven by endless advertising and marketing that tells them that they’re part of the future, and it’s a future where they’re going to be rich…. This is why I find those who call people worried about cryptocurrency “skeptics” so annoying—because the alternative is only zealotry…. By humoring Bitcoin as a valid store of value or investment, you are tacitly approving of the fact that there is no valid reason why it is worth anything, let alone tens of thousands of dollars. By having superstars talk about how this is “the future,” you are tricking the average person into believing that there is hope, all while throwing them into markets that are almost purpose-built to exploit…</p><p>LINK:</p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:55856747,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://ez.substack.com/p/if-youre-not-a-skeptic-youre-a-sucker&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:8982,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Ed Zitron's Where's Your Ed At&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/97017fa1-b263-4616-902f-774b57da05f1_256x256.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;If You're Not A Skeptic, You're A Sucker&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Earlier today, I answered a question about why I am so troubled by cryptocurrency after all of these years, and I came up with a simple answer: people are getting hurt, and it’s only going to get worse.

Right-neoliberalism said that <em><strong>of course</strong></em><strong> </strong>the only rights that did and should matter were property rights, and the point was to concentrate them in the hands of the right people. And the reaction against this two-headed doctrine? We should not be surprised that the reaction, and thus the attack against the liberal order that neoliberalism had hollowed out, came from the neo-fascist ethno-nationalist right, rather than from the pseudo-socialist left:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tom Clark</strong>: <em>How the Rich Ate Us</em>: ‘<em>The Rise and Fall of the Neoliberal Order: America and the World n the Free Market Era</em> by Gary Gerstle; <em>Liberalism and its Discontents</em> by Francis Fukuyama…. P&amp;O Ferries… confessed to having breached the obligations of redundancy law, but pleaded that this was in the service of an overriding duty—to the bottom line…. American liberals… in a… reflective mood… are interrogating the nature of the age we’ve been living through…. Francis Fukuyama… the wonderfully crisp <em>Liberalism and its Discontents</em>… the illiberal backlash as provoked by extreme offshoots of liberalism, one of them being neoliberalism, which has produced “grotesque inequalities” by hardening the traditional liberal presumption of free exchange to the point where “the doctrine becomes, so to speak, doctrinaire.”… Gary Gerstle… knows what a political order involves: a web of rules, institutions, presumptions and people that can survive a change of government…. What eventually crashed the neoliberal order, as Gerstle sees it, was not any progressive challenge, but… Donald Trump, who rode into Washington on a tide of rants about immigration and global trade…. Only with a “property first” rather than a “freedom first” reading of neoliberalism can we understand how Mises could hail 1920s fascism as a “makeshift” salvation for civilisation against the left, and grasp why the ageing Hayek would defend the 1970s coup against an elected socialist government in Chile, which brought Pinochet’s murderous regime to power. Yes, ideas had an important role in the neoliberal story. But ultimately it has been an instrumental one…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/how-the-rich-ate-us">https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/how-the-rich-ate-us</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Why “we said we would do something stupid, and now that it is clear that it is really stupid we really must keep our word and do it” gains you the kind of credibility you want to have has always been very hard for me to understand:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Paul Krugman</strong>: <em>How Low Must Inflation Go?</em>: ‘It look… well above 2 percent inflation, which the Fed and other central banks have traditionally seen as their target. And the Fed is set to continue tightening until that target is hit. So why is 2 percent the target?… During Ronald Reagan’s second term, America’s underlying inflation rate was roughly what it is now. Yet policymakers were strutting around boasting about their victory over inflation, and the public didn’t see inflation as a major concern…. If we are about to have a recession… it won’t be because hard economic considerations require that we squeeze inflation all the way back down to 2 percent. What we’re seeing instead is monetary policy driven by softer, vaguer concerns about credibility.

One of the most very eminent of Swarthmore professors might—<em><strong>might</strong></em>—be able to exact as much social and cultural deference as one of those 500, in some circles. But the associate director of an urban non-profit making 1/100 as much? Now there is the constant, for the past 2500 years, cry of the old vs. the young: “I do not know what Rome is coming to. These days a pretty-boy costs more than a sword, and a jar of imported fermented fish sauce more than a farm! <em>O tempora! O mores!</em>” What does Timothy Burke think that this “social and cultural deference” might possibly be? And how is it exercised and made visible? The $5 million-a-year guys are fine with the world, unless they have gotten themselves trapped in the Fox News grift.</p><p>In what alternate universe is the usually very smart Timothy Burke living? (Yes, I know: it is the Swarthmore campus.):</p><blockquote><p><strong>Timothy Burke</strong>: <em>Academia: Disentanglement</em>: ‘There is an attainment of cultural status that is “class-like”… conferred in part by elite selective higher education. The graduate of an elite selective college or university who is making $45,000 as the associate director of an urban non-profit may be granted a kind of cultural and social deference that is not shown to the graduate of a regional public who owns a car dealership that makes him $5 million a year…. It… structures a whole range of status markers, forms of address, and especially access to the “attention economy” or to mass media. What Adler-Bell and others call “wokeness” is just a small subset of this kind of sorting.
