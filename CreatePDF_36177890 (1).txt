Paragraphs:

For a century now the forces that are now Likud and the forces that are now Hamas have chosen 
violence in the Middle Easta€”glory in it, and think that it strengthens them vis-a-vis their own 
internal political opponents, as
long as each can pretend to its core supporters that it is protecting them rather than endangering 
them by amplifying violence. We almost got this under control in 1995. But then Israeli rightists 
assassinated Yitzhak Rabin,
and Likud and Hamas both managed to choose violence and make chaos their ladders to victory over 
their internal political adversaries. And here we still are today:

Jonathan Katz: Finding what youa€™ re looking for: a€~The trigger for the current crisis was an 
attempt by Jewish settlers to seize four Palestinian homesa€!. The incompetence and viciousness of
Jerusalema€™ s Jewish authorities and the government of Benjamin Netanyahua€!. Israeli police 
respondeda€! with brutal force, and then, inexplicably, by attacking the Al-Aqsa Mosquea€”the
third holiest site in Islama€”with tear gas, rubber-tipped bullets, and stun grenades, during 
Ramadan prayersa€!. Hamas responded with rocketsa€L Israel responded by murdering Gazan civilians.

And now here we area€!. Hamas has no more monopoly on resistance to Israeli occupation or apartheid 
than Netanyahua€™ s Likud Party and its ethnonationalist allies do on the fight for the survival
of Jews. Both can and must be opposed. The other is to keep in mind the humanity of the individuals 
involveda€!. Only a common understanding of one anothera€™ s humanity and the rights that
humanity entails will ultimately end it. Otherwise, there will be only more sufferinga€!

What happens in 2024 should there be Republican congressional majorities that disenfranchise 
Californiaa€™ s electoral votes. I presume then Kamala Harris will try to defuse the situation by 
gaveling the joint session into
recess, and California will then appeal to the Supreme Court to mandate that congress count the 
votes, on the grounds that while the Constitution says that each House shall set its own procedures 
(by majority vote) it says no
such thing about the procedures for a joint session. But we are, still, on the edge of a knife:

Martin Wolf: The Struggle for the Survival of US Democracy: a€~In a liberal democracy fair 
elections determine who holds power. Trying to distort or overturn the vote is treason Donald Trump
tried to do both before and after last yeara€™ s presidential election. He tried to turn the United 
States into a dictatorship. This was not at all surprising: It was clear from the beginning of his 
political
career that this was his goala€!

When global uplift became an explicit major policy goal of the United States of America:

Harry S. Truman: 1949 Inaugural Address: a€~[ 1 ] We will continue to give unfaltering support to 
the United Nations and related agencies, and we will continue to search for ways to strengthen their
authority and increase their effectivenessa€!. [2] We will continue our programs for world economic 
recoverya€!. [3] We will strengthen freedom-loving nations against the dangers of aggressiona€!.

[4] We must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and 
industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areasa€!

As Duncan says, not all journalists, but when did Americaa€™ s journalists become people who worked 
so hard to be soulless psychopaths?:

Duncan Black: Eschaton: Wea€™ re in a Guild Not a Union: a€~#Notalljournalists, of course, but 
after decades of employment in their industry getting destroyed, and associated impact on the
career paths of most of those that remain, the willingness of journalists run with a€rewhat if 
minimum wage workers have it TOO GOOD?a€D stories is a bit shocking and doesna€™ t fill me with
too much sympathy for this vital functiona€!

Twenty Years Ago: Review of Richard Evans, Lying About Hitler: a€~how can Evans draw a bright, 
distinguishing line between historians like Thucydides, Syme, Taylor, and 
Gibbona€”more-than-reputable historians, great
historiansa€”all of whom go beyond the boundaries of their evidence in one way or another, and 
David Irving? Evans has a response: that what makes Irving a€rediscrediteda€O is not the 
imaginative interpretations he

builds on top of the historical evidence he has found, but instead hisa€”mendaciousa€’’handling of 
the evidence itselfa€!

Ten Years Ago: Another Note on Von Misesa€™ s (and Ron Paula€™ s) Monetary Mental Disorder: Our 
text remains: a€~Ludwig von Mises: Attempts to carry out economic reforms from the monetary side 
can never
amount to anything but an artificial stimulation of economic activity by an expansion of the 
circulation, and this, as must constantly be emphasized, must necessarily lead to crisis and 
depression. Recurring economic crises
are nothing but the consequence of attempts, despite all the teachings of experience and all the 
warnings of the economists, to stimulate economic activity by means of additional credita€!a€™ Note 
that this does not just
apply to fiat money produced by a government. This applies to all financial market asset valuations 
in excess of capital cost of production (or perhaps the value of the inventions of the gigantic 
Krell-like brain of John Galt).
They are, to von Mises, all cheats. Thus Von Mises loathes fractional reserve bankers and 
IPO-mongers as much as he loathes modern central bank chairs. The a€ revalue equals cost of 
production constant returns to scalea€D
viewpoint is an astonishingly powerful set of blinders to wear. Anybody have a better theory?a€!
