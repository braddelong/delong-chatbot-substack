An unbecoming end A resignation speech is an easy one to give. Even those folk mightily pleased to 
see you gone are willing to make some allowances for the circumstances in which the resignation 
address is given. The requirements for a successful farewell are not exacting: show some humility, 
a little knowing humour, a nod to history and the great responsibilities of office, and, perhaps
above all, depart with a certain stoic gracea€!

AJs:

Nullius in verba is a truly remarkable game changer. In nearly all human societies for nearly all 
of human history, a€oeLook, Think, Test, Tella€D is interrupted after the a€Dthinka€oe part. First 
of all, the next stage is not a€Utesta€oe but, rather: a€DDo the conclusions from thinking help 
reinforce the ability to do so of those who extract resources from the population as a hole so that 
they
view can have enough?a€oe Second, a€Utest" is really hard to do right: the experimental method is 
time-consuming, when you can do it at all: the path of least resistance is to look for an authority 
who agrees with you, and then be satisfied. This is what modern science starting with the British 
Royal Society turns away from, and this is what makes it such an extraordinary success: Test
everything. Believe nothing simply because someone earlier has written down the words without doing 
the experiments:

Chad Orzel: The Three Definitions of a€oeSciencea€T2 a€~I) A process for generating reliable models 
of the worlda€!. a€oeLook, Think, Test, Tella€Da€;. II) A body of verified knowledge about the 
world. One of the outcomes of the iterative process of Definition I is a collectiona€! of models 
about the world that have been very thoroughly subjected to the scientific
processa€!. Much of this knowledge is embodied in technology: we use our knowledge of orbital 
mechanics to launch satellites, our knowledge of light to make optical telecom networks, our 
knowledge of genetics to predict and treat diseases, etc. Ill) A collection of institutions and 
formal practices associated with the people who carry out the process of sciencea€!.

Nearly all of the arguments about what a€ceSciencea€D is and isna€™ t involves blurring one or more 
of these togethera€!. The iterative trial-and-error process of Definition Ia€! is truly universal, 
practiced by basically every human culture at some level. At least for knowledge like a€oelf you 
have these symptoms, you should eat these plantsa€Da€!

The Three Definitions of "Science"

Several years ago now, I wrote a book about the universality of science, Eureka: Discovering Your

The reasons why the UK economy is stagnant seem to me to be relatively shallow. They seem to me to 
be: Cameron, Osborne, Clegg, May, and Johnson. You can throw in Corbyn if you like. Perhaps you can 
say that there is something structural about British politics that such horrible, cynical, 
destructive, and incompetent-at-policy leaders have commanded parliamentary majorities in the past
fifteen years. But I tend to attribute the disaster to sheer contingency:

Martin Wolf: The UK Economy Is Stagnanta€” & the Reasons Run Deep'. a€~Boris Johnsona€™ sa€! hasa€! 
been an immensely significant political leader, albeit a disastrous one. He has shifted the debate 
on core issues from solutions to symbols. This is true, above all, of Brexit, his enduring 
legacya€!. [But] Brexit is not the most important challenge confronting
British policymakersa€!. The 15 years between 2004 and 2019a€”pre-Covid and pre-Brexita€”were the 
weakest for growth in gross domestic product per head since the years between 1919 and 1934a€!. The 
UKa€™ s relative GDP per head hasa€! fallen, from 92 per cent of German levels in 2007, to 87 per 
cent in 2015 and 82 per cent in 202la€!. The big question in
UK economic policy is how to end the stagnation. The answer will not be tax cutsa€!. Nor will it be 
deregulation^!. It will depend on higher investment^! bringing lagging firms and regions to the 
frontiera€! improvements in corporate governance and capital marketsa€! exploiting the energy 
revolution, to accelerate growth and lower emissions. Candidates for the
highest office must offer serious answers to these big challenges. And they must make those answers 
credible, despite the folly of Brexit. Will they do so? I doubt ita€!

If you are interested in Malthusian economies, you should be interested in Lemina€™ s work:

Lemin Wu (2015): If Not Malthusian, Then Why?'. a€™ The Malthusian mechanism cannot explaina€! 
pre-industrial stagnation^!. Technological improvement in luxury productiona€!, would have kept 
living standards growing. The Malthusian trap is essentially a puzzle of balanced growth between 
the luxury sector and the subsistence sectora€! [probably] caused by
group selection in the form of biased migrationa€!. A tiny bit of bias in migration can suppress a 
strong tendency of growth. The theory reexplains the Malthusian trap and the prosperity of ancient 
market economies such as Rome and Song. It also suggests a new set of triggering factors of modern 
economic growtha€!

Let me strongly second Cosma here:

Cosma Shalizi (2014): Elizabeth L. Eisenstein, The Printing Press as an Agent of Change: a€~This is 
and deserves to be a modern classica€!. Eisensteina€™ s fundamental point, which I think is 
entirely sound, is that you cannot understand anything about the transition from ancient or 
medieval intellectual life to the modern life of the mind without grasping the
importance of being able to quickly, cheaply make large numbers of very accurate copies of a text, 
and distribute them widelya€!. The anthropologist Dan Sperber once wrote that a€oeculture is the 
precipitate of cognition and communication in a human populationa€D. Even with my quibbles, this is 
the best examination Ia€™ ve ever seen about how changing the
means of communication changed the culture of a human population. That transformation is still 
reshaping the world, and I think this book is essential reading for coming to grips with ita€!
