Five Paragraphs:

1) Cutting yourself loose from your relationship with your largest trading partner is not usually a 
source of strength or freedom. And with an a€ceevasivea€D fabulist like Boris Alexander de Pfeffel 
Johnson in charge of setting the course, Britaina€™ s future looks like one of near-stagnation. 
Think of what has happened in the past fifteen years to Italy, but with much worse weather:

Chris Patten: The UKa€™ s Hard Brexit Choices Have Arrived: a€~Almost all serious economists and 
business leaders expecta€! slower economic growth for the foreseeable future (as a result of 
Britain having left its main export market)a€!. The government has not released an official 
projection of Brexita€™ s economic impact; if the figures were good, they would be
published in bolda€!. While ministers hunt for excuses, businesses face higher costs, more red 
tape, and delayed supplies. a€oeGlobal Britaina€D will apparently get around such problems by 
finding new markets in Asiaa€!. [But] there is no tunnel between Folkestone and New Delhi, and 
there are not 10,000 goods trucks a day shuttling between Dover and Shanghaia€!.
Stronger UK-China trade ties would present Johnson with another hard choice. Will Britain continue 
to stand with other liberal democracies like the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan in 
trying to contain the threat that China poses to its region and the international rule of law? Or 
will it kowtow whenever President Xi Jinpinga€™ s regime stamps its feet?a€! The
UKa€™ s tough choices accumulated!. The problems lurking around the corner look menacing. Britain 
will have to make the best of Brexit. But it will be a long, hard struggle, all the more so with an 
evasive fabulist in charged!

2) The bullshit flows fast, thick, and plentifully from Facebook these days:

Alyse Stanley: Zuck Slowly Shrinks & Transforms Into a Corncob Ahead of Applea€™ s Looming Privacy 
Updates: d'Facebook has pushed back against Appled™ s planned rollout of anti-tracking tools at 
every possible opportunity, but now the social media giant seems to be changing its tune in a 
last-ditch effort to save faced!. Zuckerberg said Facebook may actually
be in a doestronger positiondD after the privacy updatesd!. (As you might already suspect, 
Facebookd™ s claims have been found to be misleading at best, and self-serving propaganda at the 
worst)d!

3) I do not know whether Teslas this-is-definitely-not-an-autopilot here is simply being in human, 
or is also very badly programmed. But since it is going to deal with humans, acting in a way that 
communicates verbally and nonverbally with humans in a way that reassures and informs them is a 
vital importance. And that seems to have been badly neglected here:

Elizabeth Blackstock: Terrifying Drone Footage Of Tesla Making Unprotected Left Turn: d'Full video 
on Chuck Cookd™ s YouTube channeld!. His car waits and waits for an opportunity to turn left 
between bursts of traffic. The left turn isnd™ t a difficult one for most driversd!. The car just 
kind of waits in limbo until it deems the moment is right, which it will only
do if it decides crossing is safe. So that means it just kind ofd! takes off. It doesnd™t give Cook 
a warning. It just goes. And as you can see in the clip above, Cook doesnd™t always deem it safe to 
do so, which means he needs to be on high alert to grab the wheel or hit the brakes. It kind of 
negates the whole purpose of it being a driver assistance program when the
driver has to be more alert than normal. This comes just after last weekd™ s video showing the 
absolute chaos thatd™ s going on with Teslad™ s Full Self Driving Beta programd!

4) I confess that I do not know how to figure out whether or not the decline of the open web and 
the rise of the wannabe walled gardensd’’wannabe gardens like Facebook and Twitter and, yes, you 
too Google that treat their users like cattle to be tripped, drifted, misinformed, and scared out 
of their witsa€”was a mirror on the thing or not. Would it have survived had Google not decided 
that RSS
feeds were its enemy as a mode of disintermediation? But it is easy to insert ads in the RSS feeds! 
Whatever. Google killed its Google RSS Reader, and so here we are. I would really like to know why, 
and how to make it better:

Kevin Drum: Why Have Blog Audiences Declined Over the Past Decade?: a€~RSS was a threat to 
practically every platform that aggregates news since it allowed users to decide for themselves 
what news they wanted to seea€”and to see it without passing through a gatekeeper. The best way to 
eliminate this threat was to eliminate or reduce support for RSS, as Google,
Facebook, and Twitter have all done. Blogs were just collateral damage here. An RSS reader is the 
only decent way to read a collection of blogs, and with the demise of RSS and Google Reader it 
became more difficult to follow blogs. Sure, lots of people switched to a different reader, but 
lots more didna€™ t know how or just never got around to it. And with that, the decline
in  blog readership accelerated. This was the start of a vicious cycle that opened up opportunities 
for Twitter, Medium, YouTube, podcasts, Substack, and other platforms that increasingly replaced 
blogs as the place for web-centric conversation^!

5) This strikes me as very, very good news indeed. Now all we have to do is teach people how to do 
this, and also construct truth sandwiches:

Anna Funk: Scientists Can Implant False MemoriesaC” & Reverse Them'. a€~Two key methods [that] 
helped participants differentiate their own real recollections from the false ones: Asking them to 
recall the source of the memory. Explaining to them that being pressured to recall something 
multiple times can induce false memories. WHY THIS MATTERSa€’’Ultimately,
the team found rich, false memories can mostly be undone. And they can be undone relatively easily. 
a€oelf you can bring people to this point where they are aware of that, you can empower them to 
stay closer to their own memories and recollections, and rule out the suggestion from other 
sources,a€D Oeberst says. a€oeYou dona€™ t need to know what the truth of the
matter is, which is why they a€™ re nice strategies,a€D false memory expert Elizabeth Loftus, who 
was not involved in the study, tells Inversea€!
