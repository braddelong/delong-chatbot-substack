This may well be wrong: my guess is that there is a 1/4 chance I will delete this tomorrow:

a€oeVladimir Putina€! decid[ed] not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future 
generationsa€! for two key reasonsa€!. National securitya€! the creation ofa€! an outpost for the 
West to put pressure on us, is only the second most importanta€!. The first would always bea€! 
[erasing] national humiliation^’’when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation
(Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states, not onea€! 
gnash[ing] onea€™ s teeth helplessly, remembering the times when a€~we lost Ukrainea€™ a€!a€D

Full annexation of Ukraine (and Belarus) was on the menu.

Moreover, somebodies thought it would be all over by nowa€”that this would have followed the 
Czechoslovakia-in-1939 playbook, and that it would've been largely a parade of tank columns into 
and through Ukraine, while NATO dithered, and the Ukrainian government fled into exile. And then 
nobody dared to say "this is not going according to plana€D and pulled it back
before publication.

But who was the intended audience for this? And whose thinking does this represent? Are these 
people attempting to anticipate the FAUhrer, as the saying goesa€”figure out today what his desires 
tomorrow will be, or at least what will flatter him when he sees how you are trying to anticipate 
his desires?

Christo Grozev: a€™ Yesterday, multiple Russian state media published ana€! essay: it presumed 
a€oePutin solved the Ukrainian question for evera€na€”i.e. it presumed Russia took over Ukraine and 
essentially annexed it into a forever-newa€“old-uniona€!. This essay was apparently written for a 
scenario where Russian armed forces had taken over
Kyiv and subjugated the countrya€! Which didna€™ t actually happen. So, what did state news agency 
do? They deleted the article, as if the plan had never been published in the first place, (if you 
click on the article link you will get a non-existing pagea€!but herea€™ s the original, archived:

<https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/https://ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html>)a€!. 
This same essay was carried on other state-run channels tooa€L

So indeed, this was meant to toast a Greater Russia outcome that never happened. Herea€™ s the plan 
the author hada€”and apparently, was seen as endorseable by state media:

A new world is being born before our eyes. Russiaa€™ s military operation in Ukraine has ushered in 
a new eraa€”and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here 
begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic systema€”but this 
is worth talking about
separately a little later.

Russia is restoring its unitya€”the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its 
unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a 
virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian 
armies, are still shooting at each other, but
there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia.

Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people 
togethera€”in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned 
this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only 
betray the memory of our ancestors, but
would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding 
not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to 
solve it would always remain the main problem for Russiaa€”for two key reasons. And the issue of 
national security, that is, the creation
of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second 
most important among them.

The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national 
humiliation^’’when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced 
to come to terms with the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to 
abandon their history, agreeing with the insane
versions that a€oeonly Ukraine is the real Russia,a€D or to gnash onea€™ s teeth helplessly, 
remembering the times when a€oewe lost Ukraine .a€D

Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every 
decadea€’’recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against 
Russians would gain momentum. And in the event of the consolidation of the full geopolitical and 
military control of the West over
Ukraine, its return to Russia would become completely impossiblea€”it would have to fight for it 
with the Atlantic bloc.

Now this problem is gonea€’’Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood 
will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of 
part of the Russian world. Within what boundaries, in what form will the alliance with Russia be 
consolidated (through the CSTO and
the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be decided after the end is 
put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian 
people is coming to an end.

And here begins the second dimension of the coming new eraa€”it concerns Russiaa€™ s relations with 
the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and 
Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole. These relations have entered a new 
stagea€”the West sees the return of Russia
to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of 
his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would 
give up Kyiv? That the Russians will forever be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe 
is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration 
from the Anglo-Saxons and
assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to 
the unification of Germany, which took place according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) 
will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of 
geopolitical stupidity. The West as a
whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its 
sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, 
one had to be just geopolitical fools.

More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the 
Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And 
already fifteen years ago, after Putina€™ s Munich speech, even the deaf could heara€”Russia is 
returning.

Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans 
to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. Seeking 
to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has 
not been the case for a long timea€”the world
has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who 
rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses 
from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and 
geopolitically. But for the West
itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costsa€”and the main ones are not at 
all economic.

Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomya€’’the German project of European integration does not 
make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical 
control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a 
controlled Europe. But Europe
needs autonomy for another reason as wella€”in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result 
of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the 
geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the 
Europeans of even the chance of independence, not to mention the fact that they are trying to force 
a break with China in the same way on Europe. If now the Atlanticists are happy that the 
a€oeRussian threata€D will unite the
Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for 
autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why 
independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on 
their eastern bordersa€’’realizing that it will turn
into  a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership 
is over in any casea€”but various options for its future are still possible.

Because the construction of a new world ordera€”and this is the third dimension of current 
eventsa€”is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading 
cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a realitya€”the operation 
in Ukraine is not capable of rallying
anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly 
wella€”this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical 
expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russiaa€™ s return of its historical space and its place in 
the world.

China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asiaa€”no one believes 
that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only 
challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered 
completely and finally over. The new
world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West 
(united or not)a€”but not on its terms and not according to its rules.
