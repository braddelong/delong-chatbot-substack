The Great Depression, postwar social democracy, the race question, the history of technology, are all addressed from an American point of view…. </p><p>For DeLong the long era of American dominance was concluded in the decade after 2008, a period characterised by secular stagnation and the ascent of Donald Trump. One can see why this combination was traumatic for veterans of the 1990s-era Clinton administration. But, as a world historic caesura, it is something of an anticlimax. Does the shock of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 defeat really rank alongside the fall of the Soviet Union or the rise of China? Or is the relative banality of that moment, the confirmation of the bigger point, that for all its monumental self-obsession the American narrative is losing its ability to organise our understanding of the world?…</p></blockquote><p>1/ Well, yes. </p><p>Being the furnace where the future was being forged from <em>circa</em> 1870 up until <em>circa</em> 2010, and being the world’s hyperpower and hegemon from 1945 to 2005, will get you a lot. </p><p>Views from Moscow or London or Paris or Delhi or Mombasa are very interesting, but you do see more from the perspective of Washington and New York—albeit from a point of view that is, in many ways, very peculiar indeed. In fact, I would say that the failure of Hobsbawm’s <em>Age of Extremes</em> to take a properly Americanocentric point-of-view is (one of the things that is) crippling to the book’s ability to tell the history as it really happened. <em>Ars longa; vita brevis.</em> I believe the Americanocentric point-of-view allows us to come closer to doing our proper job than any other.</p><div><hr></div><p>2/ I think Adam has misread me here. I do not say that the long 20th century came to an end in 2016, with Hillary Rodham Clinton’s defeat. I say it had ended by 2010, as various pieces of the pattern of previous history had fallen away in 1990, 1993, 2001, 2005, 2010, and so forth. 2016 marked the end of any hopes for revivification and resurrection. The end of a funeral is not the moment of death.</p><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/publish/post/75272792?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thank you for reading Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality.
