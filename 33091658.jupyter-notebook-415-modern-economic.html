<h1><strong>Problem Set 4.1.5. How Important Are Resources in Generating Late 20th-Century Global Inequality?</strong></h1><h2>Do resources play an important role on a global scale in relative prosperity?</h2><p>These notebook assignments are a required part of the course.</p><p>Collaborating on the notebooks is more than okay—it is encouraged! Seek help from a classmate or an instructor or a roommate or a passerby when you get stuck! (Explaining things is beneficial, too—the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.)</p><p>But the work should be your own.</p><p>No cutting-&amp;-pasting from others' notebooks, please! We want you to learn this stuff, and your fingers typing every keystroke is an important way of building muscle memory here.</p><p>In this notebook, you will attempt to assess whether and how much engrossment of natural resources by the global north since the start of the commercial revolution era in 1500 has played an important role in the rise of global inequality.</p><p>Let us get started!</p><h1>1. Preliminaries</h1><h3>A. Computing environment</h3><p>First, we set up the computing environment with the libraries we need:</p><p>In&nbsp;[&nbsp;]:</p><pre><code><em># 4.1.5.1.A.1. set up the computing environment: ensure that graphs# appear inline in the notebook &amp; not in extra windows:</em>  %<strong>matplotlib</strong> inline </code></pre><p>In&nbsp;[&nbsp;]:</p><pre><code><em># 4.1.5.1.A.2. set up the computing environment: standard libraries...</em><strong>importnumpyasnpimportpandasaspd</strong></code></pre><p>In&nbsp;[&nbsp;]:</p><pre><code><em># 4.1.5.1.A.3. set up the computing environment: plotting library</em><strong>importmatplotlibasmplimportmatplotlib.pyplotasplt</strong></code></pre><h3>B.

Global North &amp; Global South</h1><h3>A. Global North</h3><p>Now let me provide you with another set of data analogous to those for the world as a whole. This set will be for the "global north" or "west"—that part of the world that dominated the Americas starting in the 1500s and then became much richer and more powerful than the rest since the start of the 1700s—consisting of northwest Europe, and then by 1770 of that plus the Atlantic seaboard of the Americas, adding on Australia and New Zealand by 1870, and now including those areas plus southwest and some of central Europe, plus Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.</p><p>The data are:</p><p>In&nbsp;[&nbsp;]:</p><pre><code><em># 4.1.5.2.A.1. for the "global north" or "west":</em>  long_run_growth_list_global_north = [     [-68000, 0.00001, 1200, 379.47, 0.0001],     [-8000, 0.1, 1200, 1897.37, 0.0294],     [-6000, 0.2, 900, 2012.5, 0.0294],     [-3000, 0.5, 900, 3182, 0.0294],     [-1000, 2, 900, 6364.1, 0.0294],     [1, 5, 900, 10062.5, 0.0294],     [1500, 25, 1000, 25000.4, 0.0294],     [1770, 75, 1400, 42866.8, 0.0588],     [1870, 175, 2800, 106928.6, 0.0882],     [2020, 800, 50000, 3580637.4, 0.1147]     ] </code></pre><p>Note that there is an extra column: it will be "resources"—the share of the world's resources that is occupied/owned/conquered/exploited by the global north.

Population</h3><p>Note that the population of the global north grows for two reasons: (1) the populations of economies already in it expand in its own territories and then in other territories it conquers, occupies, and settles; and (2) new economies join it. In 1500 the civilization we now call the "global north" was pretty much restricted to the countries that touched or were just across the sea from what is now Belgium and Holland—and of what are now France and Germany, only northern France and nortwestern Germany counted. Now it encompasses all of western and most of central Europe, North America, and Asia's Pacific Rim plus Australia and New Zealand.</p><h3>B. Resources</h3><p>Note that the natural resources controlled by the global north grew both because the global north expanded in area and becomes its citizens acquired—well, largely stole—resources outside of the global north, many of which global north citizens control to this day.</p><h3>C. Productivity</h3><p>We first see the global north acquiring a (very small) edge in productivity, income per capita, and living standard growth over the period 1 to 1500. Northwest Europe in 1500 is an an up-phase of the Malthusian cycle: it lost 1/4 of its population to the Black Plague of 1346-8, and subsequent plagues kept its population from recovering, leaving it with a favorable land-labor ratio and a high level of labor productivity. It also had a small edge in technology: sails and guns and clocks, mostly.</p><p>Then, after 1500, in the three subsequent Commercial Revolution, Industrial Revolution, and 20th-century Modern Economic Growth Ages, the global north's productivity and income edge surges: useful ideas are invented and deployed in the global north faster than they diffuse across the global south, resources are engrossed by the global north through settlement, expansion, conquest, theft, purchase, and investment. And, until the demographic transition to something close to zero population growth in the global north becomes well established, its population share of the world grows as well.</p><h3>D. Not in the Model</h3><p>The numbers in the "differences" table above understate the magnitude of the true historical differences between the global north and south for three reasons not in the model that seem to me to be obvious, and perhaps for other non-obvious reasons as well.</p><p>First, the global north did not just gain growth advantage from the workings of the global economy and its imperialism after 1500. It gained a current consumption advantage as well, for a component of production and income earned in the global south was transferred to the global north.</p><p>Second, the model above has no place in it for the people killed, enslaved, and enserfed.</p><p>Third, the model has no place in it for differences and changes in the terms-of-trade between global north and global south. Put broadly, The terms of trade of market exchange favored the global north from 1500 to 1770, then favored the global south from 1770 to 1860, then favored the global south as far as manufactured and the global north as far as resource products were concerned from 1860 to 1950, and, last, have favored the global north—with a very important exception of oil—since 1950.</p><p>Plus imperialism and exploitation were profoundly uneven. They share of global south resources in Asia conquered by the global north was small. But if you happen to live on an island in the East Indies and the Portuguese or Dutch arrived, the likelihood was that they took everything that was not nailed down—and then exploited and diverted the income from a lot that was.</p><h3>E. Questions:</h3><p>Now let me ask you some questions that you can then do calculations to answer:</p><h4>1. Productivity Multiple—a Worked Example</h4><p>What relative multiple of global-south average income and productivity do we guess global-north average income and productivity was in 1500?

Growth Rate Differentials</h4><p>How much greater has been the growth rate of the resources available to the global north than to the global south since 1500? And what have been the differences in population growth rates? And in ideas-stock growth rates?</p><p>In&nbsp;[&nbsp;]:</p><pre><code><em># 4.1.5.3.E.4.  resource growth-rate difference since 1500?# notice that this is simply simply # 4.1.5.3.E.3. with# "rho" replacing "g"; simply take a weighted average# resource_growth_rate_diff_1500_2020 = ...</em>  print("The difference in annual average resource-availability growth rates since 1500 =",        resource_growth_rate_diff_1500_2020) </code></pre><p>In&nbsp;[&nbsp;]:</p><pre><code><em># 4.1.5.3.E.4.a. n growth-rate difference since 1500?</em>  population_growth_rate_diff_1500_2020 = ...  print("The difference in annual average population growth rates since 1500 =",        population_growth_rate_diff_1500_2020) </code></pre><p>In&nbsp;[&nbsp;]:</p><pre><code><em># 4.1.5.3.E.4.b.  h growth-rate difference since 1500?</em>  ideas_growth_rate_diff_1500_2020 = ...  print("The difference in annual average ideas growth rates since 1500 =",        ideas_growth_rate_diff_1500_2020) </code></pre><h4>5. Counterfactuals...</h4><p>And now we get to the point of the whole exercise. Recall that our very crude growth framework assumes that ideas are twice as salient in boosting productivity and income than resources per capita are at retarding it—that while a 1% increase in the value of the ideas stock boosts income and productivity by 1%, other things being equal—<em>ceteris paribus</em>, if we drop into Latin, and&nbsp;<em>cet. par.</em>&nbsp;if we drop into Latin and abbreviate, as John Maynard Keynes's teachers back around 1900 were wont to do—an increase in resources per capita by 1% increased income and productivity by only 0.5%. (And, of course, this runs in reverse as well for resource scarcity per capita or for ideas lack depressing income and productivity.)</p><p>In equations, the relationship between the rates of labor-efficiency growth g, ideas growth h, resource-stock growth ⍴, and population and labor-force growth n is:</p><blockquote><p>g=h+ρ−n2</p></blockquote><p>Suppose that the global north had not engrossed more of the world's resources since 1500—that the 850 million people in today's global north were still drawing on the 2.71% of the global resource base that northwest European civilization drew on back in 1500.</p><p>What does our model then say would be the difference in income and productivity growth rates between the global north and south since 1500—the number that you calculated (or should have calculated) as 0.00339 (that is, 0.34%/year)?</p><p>In&nbsp;[&nbsp;]:</p><pre><code><em># 4.1.5.3.E.5.  counterfactual stable-resources income differential growth rate since 1500# resource_stability_counterfactual_income_growth_rate_diff_1500_2020 = ...</em>  print("RESOURCE STABILITY COUNTERFACTUAL") print("The difference in annual average income growth rates since 1500 would have been =",        resource_stability_counterfactual_income_growth_rate_diff_1500_2020) </code></pre><h4>6. Relative Productivity in the Counterfactual</h4><p>Under that resource-stability counterfactual, what relative multiple of global-south average income and productivity do we guess about the analogue to the answer to the 6.49—what global-north average income and productivity as a multiple of global south would have been today, holding all variable in our model other than resource access and availability constant?</p><p>In&nbsp;[&nbsp;]:</p><pre><code><em># 4.1.5.3.E.6.  resource-stability counterfactual; current global-north income multiple# resource_stability_counterfactual_income_diff_2020 = ...</em>  print("RESOURCE STABILITY COUNTERFACTUAL") print("Global north average income today as a multiple of global south would have been =",        resource_stability_counterfactual_income_diff_2020) </code></pre><p>If all has gone well you got an answer of 6.49—the actual multiple of global north income today relative to global south—and an answer of 3.14 for question—what that multiple would have been had the 850 million people today in the global north not owned and controlled immense proportions of the world's resources outside global-north civilization's original northwest European homelands clustered around what are now Belgium and Holland.</p><h4>7.
