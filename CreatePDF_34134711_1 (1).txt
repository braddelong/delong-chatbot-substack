Here's me: We are still here, but it is not our time to lead.  Barack Obama rolls into office with 
Mitt Romneya€™ s health care policy, with John McCaina€™ s climate policy, with Bill Clintona€™ s 
tax policy, and George H.W. Busha€™ s foreign policy. And did George H.W. Bush, did Mitt Romney, 
did John McCain say a single good word about anything Barack Obama ever did

over the course of eight solid years? No, they f—ing did not.... While I would like to be part of a 
political coalition in the cat seat, able to call for bids from the left and the right about who 
wants to be part of the governing coalition to actually get things done, thata€™ s simply not 
possible...

And: Our current bunch of leftists are wonderful people.  Theya€™re social democrats, theya€™re 
very strong believers in democracy. Theya€™re very strong believers in fair distribution of wealth. 
They could use a little more education about what is likely to work and what is not. But theya€™re 
people who wea€™re very, very lucky to have on our side. Thata€™ s

especially opposed to the people on the other side, who are very, very strange indeed. You listen 
to [Never Trump conservatives]... about all the people they had been with in meetings, biting their 
tongues over the past 25 years, and your reaction can only be, a€oeWhy didna€™t you run away 
screaming into the night long ago?a€D...

And: We learned more about the world. I could be confident in 2005 that [recession] stabilization 
should be the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. That you look at something like laser-eye 
surgery or rapid technological progress in hearing aids, you can kind of think that keeping a 
market in the most innovative parts of health care would be a good thing. So something like an
insurance-plus-exchange system would be a good thing to have in America as a whole. Ita€™ s much 
harder to believe in those things now. Thata€™ s one part of it. The world appears to be more like 
what lefties thought it was than what I thought it was for the last 10 or 15 yearsa€!

A Clinton-era centrist Democrat explains why ita€™s time to give democratic socialists a chance

a€oeThe baton rightly passes to our colleagues on our left.a€D By Zack

The rise of the Democratic left, personified by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), has raised a serious question: Should Democrats lean away from 
market-friendly stances and get comfortable with big government again? Should they embrace an 
ambitious 2020 candidate like Sanders and policies like the Green New Deal, or stick with
incrementalists like former Vice President Joe Biden and more market-oriented ideas like Obamacare?

One of the most interesting takes Ia€™ ve seen on this debate came from Brad DeLong, an economist 
at the University of California-Berkeley. DeLong, who served as deputy assistant secretary of the 
Treasury for economic policy in the Clinton administration, who is one of the market-friendly, 
a€oeneoliberala€n Democrats who have dominated the party for the last 20 years. The
term he uses for himself is a€oeRubin Democrata€D a€” referring to followers of finance 
industry-friendly Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.

Yet DeLong believes that the time of people like him running the Democratic Party has passed. 
a€oeThe baton rightly passes to our colleagues on our left,a€D DeLong wrote. a€oeWe are still here, 
but it is not our time to lead.a€D

Ita€™ s not often that someone in this policy debate a€” or, frankly, any policy debate a€” 
suggests that their side should lose. So I reached out to DeLong to dig into the reasons for his 
position: Why does he believe that neoliberalsa€™ time in the sun has come to an end?

The core reason, DeLong argues, is political. The policies he supports depend on a responsible 
center-right partner to succeed. Theya€™ re premised on the understanding that at least a faction 
of the Republican Party would be willing to support market-friendly ideas like Obamacare or a 
cap-and-trade system for climate change. This is no longer the case, if it ever were.

DeLong notes. a€ceAnd did George H.W. Bush, did Mitt Romney, did John McCain say a single good word

Market-friendly neoliberals, rather than pushing their own ideology, should work to improve ideas 
on the

policy for the foreseeable future.

What follows is a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Zack Beauchamp

I want to start with your notion of a€oeRubin Democrats.a€D What does that mean, exactly? What was 
the movement you identify with?

Brad DeLong

I would say ita€™ s largely neoliberal, market-oriented, and market-regulation and tuning aimed at 
social democratic ends. It also involves taking a step in the direction of appeasing conservative 
priorities. The belief is that if you have a broad coalition behind such policy, it will be much 
more strongly entrenched in America and much better implemented than if it were implemented
by a narrow, largely partisan majority.

And Rubin Democrats believe that you should prioritize economic growth. Once you have economic 
growth, electorates want to become a lot less Grinch-y and less likely to feel that redistribution 
to the poor is coming out of its hide, making them positively worse-off. Economic growth first, 
redistribution and beefing up the safety net second.

Zack Beauchamp

What youa€™ re describing is a broad theory of political economy, in which a vision for what 
economic policies are best is intertwined with a particular view of what makes policies popular and 
sustainable. You say something about this is wrong a€” do you think ita€™ s the political part, the 
economic part, or both?

Brad DeLong

We were certainly wrong, 100 percent, on the politics.

Barack Obama rolls into office with Mitt Romneya€™ s health care policy, with John McCaina€™ s 
climate policy, with Bill Clintona€™ s tax policy, and George H.W. Busha€™ s foreign policy. Hea€™ 
s all these things not because the technocrats in his administration think theya€™ re the best 
possible policies, but because [White House adviser] David Axelrod and company say
they poll well.

s all these things not because the technocrats in his administration think theya€™re the best 
possible policies, but because [White House adviser] David Axelrod and company say
they poll well.

And [Chief of Staff] Rahm Emanuel and company say wea€™ ve got to build bridges to the Republicans. 
Wea€™ ve got to let Republicans amend cap and trade up the wazoo, wea€™ ve got to let Republicans 
amend the [Affordable Care Act] up the wazoo before it comes up to a final vote, wea€™ ve got to 
tread very lightly with finance on Dodd-Frank, we have to do a very
premature pivot away from recession recovery to a€oeentitlement reform.a€D

All of these with the idea that you would then collect a broad political coalition behind what is, 
indeed, Mitt Romneya€™ s health care policy and John McCaina€™ s climate policy and George H.W. 
Busha€™ s foreign policy.
And did George H.W. Bush, did Mitt Romney, did John McCain say a single good word about anything 
Barack Obama ever did over the course of eight solid years?

No, they fa€”-ing did not. No allegiance to truth on anything other than the belief that John 
Boehner, Paul Ryan, and Mitch McConnell are the leaders of the Republican Party, and since theya€™ 
ve decided on scorched earth, wea€™re to back them to the hilt. So the politics were completely 
wrong, and we saw this starting back in the Clinton administration.

Today, therea€™ s literally nobody on the right between those frantically accommodating Donald 
Trump, on the one hand, and us on the other. Except for our brave friends in exile from the Cato 
Institute now trying to build something in the ruins at the [centrist] Niskanen Center. Therea€™ s 
simply no political place for neoliberals to lead with good policies that make a concession
to right-wing concerns.

Zack Beauchamp

Leta€™ s talk a little bit about the intra-Democratic fight. When you say a€oepass the baton to the 
left,a€D does that mean give up on substantive policies where you a€” meaning Rubin Democrats a€” 
disagree with the left?

Brad De Long

No. It means argue with them, to the extent that their policies are going to be wrong and 
destructive, but also accept that there is no political path to a coalition built from the 
Rubin-center out. Instead, we accommodate ourselves to those on our left. To the extent that they 
will not respond to our concerns, what theya€™re proposing is a helluva better than the 
poke-in-the-eye with a
sharp stick. Thata€™ s either Trumpist proposals or the current status.

Zack Beauchamp

So the position is not that neoliberals should abandon their policy beliefs. Ita€™ s that you need 
to reorient your understanding of who your coalition is.

Brad DeLong

Yes, but thata€™ s also relevant to policy beliefs, right?

A belief in cap and trade a€” rather than the carbon tax plus huge, honking public research a€” was 
both a belief that the market really ought to rule here, plus a belief that stakeholders who are 
producing carbon energy can be bought off with cap-and-trade: that the Koch brothers would rather 
be selling their carbon allowances than having to actually burn coal to produce things.
Plus, a belief there were Republicans who would actually think that global warming is a menace, and 
be willing to argue strenuously within the Republican coalition that something needs to be done 
about this.

A bunch of policies that depended on there being a political-economic consensus to support them, as 
part of a broad agreement about Americaa€™ s direction, are a lot worse as policies if that 
political-economic underpinning is not there. There also are a bunch of lessons about how policies 
that we thought are going to be very effective are rather less effective.

Zack Beauchamp

The response you hear from conservative and Democratic centrists, those Blue Dogs that remain, is 
that they are the partners that you need to appease, not the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez left. The 
Democratic coalition depends on winning in red states.

Brad DeLong

The first lesson is the Gingrich lesson: If youa€™re in a swing state, you lose your seat if the 
president of your party is perceived to be a failure. The highest priority for Blue Dogs in red and 
purple states a€” in 1994 and in 2010 a€” ought to have been making it clear the president of their 
party was a great success.
If there is a good state of the world in 2021 a€” the Lord willing and the creek dona€™ t rise a€” 
everyone and all Blue Dogs in office needs to recognize that and act on that.

Thata€™ s the political level and on the policy level. We tried to do health reform the 
Republicansa€™ way ,and whata€™ s now clear with a Republican Supreme Court and with a lot of 
Republican governors, any attempt to do it the Republicansa€™ way is going to get shredded. We 
tried to do climate policy the Republicansa€™ way, and got nowhere.
Until something non-rubble-ish is built in the Republican center, what might be good incremental 
policies just cannot be successfully implemented in an America as we know it today. We need 
Medicare-for-all, funded by a carbon tax, with a whole bunch of UBI rebates for the poor and public 
investment in green technologies.

Thata€™ s the best policy given the political-economic context. If the political-economic context 
were different a€” well, Ia€™ m fundamentally a neoliberal shill. It is very nice to use market 
means to social democratic ends when they are more effective, and they often are.
If                                                                                                  
                    you can properly tweak market prices, you then dona€™ t just have one smart guy 
trying to design a policy that advances an objective a€” you have 30 million people all over the 
country, all incentivized to design a policy. Thata€™ s a wonderful thing to have.

Zack Beauchamp

But despite that substantive view, you think that instead of freaking out about the leftists at the 
gates, ita€™ s smarter to side with them a€” to treat them as political coalition partners.

Brad De Long

Our current bunch of leftists are wonderful people, as far as leftists in the past are concerned. 
Theya€™re social democrats, theya€™re very strong believers in democracy. Theya€™re very strong 
believers in fair distribution of wealth. They could use a little more education about what is 
likely to work and what is not. But theya€™re people who wea€™re very, very lucky to
have on our side.

Thata€™ s especially opposed to the people on the other side, who are very, very strange indeed. 
You listen to [Never Trump conservatives] like Tom Nichols or Bruce Bartlett or Bill Kristol or 
David Frum talk about all the people they had been within meetings, biting their tongues over the 
past 25 years, and your reaction can only be, a€oeWhy didna€™ t you run away screaming
into the night long ago?a€D

Zack Beauchamp

I dona€™ t know if what youa€™ re describing is a long-running reconfiguration of American 
politics, an emergency alliance with the left to stop an out-of-control right, or both. How would 
you describe the conditions that have pushed you toward a more-left oriented position than you had 
before?

Brad DeLong

Ia€™ d say we learned more about the world.

I could be confident in 2005 that [recession] stabilization should be the responsibility of the 
Federal Reserve. That you look at something like laser-eye surgery or rapid technological progress 
in hearing aids, you can kind of think that keeping a market in the most innovative parts of health 
care would be a good thing. So something like an insurance-plus-exchange system would be a

The other part is that while I would like to be part of a political coalition in the cat seat, able 
to call for bids from the left and the right about who wants to be part of the governing coalition 
to actually get things done, thata€™ s simply not possible as of now.
We shouldna€™ t pretend that it is, or that ita€™ s going to be. We need to find ways to improve 
left-wing initiatives, rather than demand that they start from our basic position and do minor 
tweaks to make them more acceptable to their underlying position.
