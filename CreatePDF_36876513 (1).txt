I haven't had a chance to see the famous video from
Straumli Realm, except as an evocation. (My only
gateway onto the Net is very expensive.) Is it true
that humans have six legs? I wasn't sure from the

Key Insights:

•  Josef SchumpeterS™ s Soedepressions areS! forms of something which has to be done, namely, 
adjustment to previous economic change. Most of what would be effective in remedying a depression 
would be equally effective in preventing this adjustments IS□ is perhaps the most zombie of zombie 
economic ideas.

•  Schumpetera€™ s zombie leads to episodes of dorkish zombie economic derp like John CochraneS™ s 
claim in November 2008 that we needed a recession because we were thenS”in November 2008S’’building 
too many houses and employing too many people in construction:

2008Q4: exactly the wrong moment to claim that construction spending & employment are unsustainably 
high, and that a recession is needed and desirable to cool the sector off and transfer resources 
elsewherea€!

•  Another destructive zombie idea is the idea that the Phillips Curve and adaptive expectations 
guarantee that you only need to worry about inflationa€”the unemployment will take care of itself, 
and that if policy errs and pushes unemployment up too high above the natural this year, you will 
get it back because unemployment will then necessarily be an equal amount below the natural rate in 
some future yeara€”as long as inflation is stabilized.

•  The PCAE zombie leads to episodes like today, when a surprisingly large number of people who 
should know better are worrying not about unemployment but only about inflation

•  To mix metaphors, when we go hunting for zombie economic ideas, there are lots of fish in 
barrels for us to shoot. We do not have to try to shoot them all. Indeed, we should not.

• We should, instead, listen to Markus Brunnermeier at 12:30/09:30 EDT/PDT every Thursday at
