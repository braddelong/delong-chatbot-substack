He seems just like the gods in heaven,
that man who sits across from you
and bends his head to listen to

your lovely voice

and charming laugha€’’which sets my heart
aflutter in my breast, for when

I catch the merest glimpse of you,
my voice is gone,

my tonguea€™ s congealed, a subtle fire
runs flickering beneath my frame,

my eyes see blank, a buzzing noise
assails my ears,

my sweat runs cold, my bodya€™ s gripped
by shivers, my skina€™ s sallower

than grass, it seems as if Ia€™ m just
an inch from death.

But all is worth the risk since, [Love,
you time again crush lord and] serf:

[you who of old brought down great kings
and cities proud:

yes, holy Troy for Helena€™ s sake,
and Peleusa€™ son, and all the Greeks;
but Menelaus, he once more

gazed on his wife.

He left the boulevards of Troy

and homeward made his sweet return,
and laid his golden head to rest

on Helena€™ s lap.

But, Cypris, let me love againa€”
now leave the battlefield behind;
so may I prove that all my pain
is nothing worth.]
