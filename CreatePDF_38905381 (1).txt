6) I owe my persuasion on this pointa€”that Industrial Revolution-era Britaina€™ s unique path 
before 1870 was more of a a€ceglobalizationa€D phenomenon than a
a€oetechnorevolutiona€n phenomenona€”to Gregory Clark, a€oeThe Secret History of the Industrial 
Revolution,a€D Davis: U.C. Davis, 2001

<http://facuity.econ .ucdavis .edu/facuity/gclark/papers/secret2001 .pdf>.

Clarka€™ s a€oeSecret Historya€!a€D is an extremely interesting but ultimately, I think, not fully 
sustainable paper.

In it, Greg does the Greg-thing: taking an unsustainable position, turning all his intelligence and 
industry to sustaining it, and getting remarkably far. His unsustainable position is
that the British Industrial Revolution was not the start of modern economic growtha€”the 2%/year 
economy-wide improvements in lab or productivity broadly distributed over
sectors that we have seen since 1870a€”but rather the last two of the post-Medieval discrete 
localized and sector-specific industrial advances. Steam and textile machinery are
therefore classified as things like the caravel, printing.

It was only, Clark claims, a€oeaccidents of demand, demography, trade, and geographya€D that make 
this spurt appear different, but it was really, like its predecessors, a
discontinuous stroke of genius that was eventually self-limiting. In the absence of the coming of 
the technologies of the Second Industrial Revolution fueled by the industrial
research  lab to discover and develop and the coming of the modern corporation to develop and 
deploy, we might well still, today, be in a very impoverished steampunk world.

That last part of the argument may, I think, well be correct. Semi-permanent steampunk world was 
definitely a possibility as late as 1870, and may have been a probability as of
1800.

Just as the caravel made spices essential freea€”but the demand for spices was small and quickly 
satiated, so the impact was limiteda€’’and just as the printing press made books
essentially freea€”but the demand for books was small and quickly satiated, so the impact was 
limiteda€”so the steam engine made coal-for-heating essentially free and textile
machinery made spinning and weaving essentially free. And if Britain had been an autarchic economy 
with a stable population, capable of being satiated with coal-for-heating and
with spinning-and-weaving limited by wool from sheep, full stop.

So it is nevertheless the case that the price-elasticity of demand for spinning and weaving were, 
over a substantial range, worldwide, significantly greater than one did make a huge
difference, one large enough to make the BIR experience different in kind and not just the last 
post-medieval efflorescence with nothing to do with modern economic growth. Steam
and machinery mattered much more than did the caravel or the printing press. And they mattered 
because differences in a€oedemand, demography, trade, and geographya€D made
the British Industrial Revolution decisively different than anything that had come before.

The way Clark puts the argument is: in historical 1860 Britaina€™ s TFP was 100, compared to 65 in 
1780. But remove Britaina€™ s ability to export cotton textiles and require
that it move labor counterfactually out of export industry into the production of goods that were 
historically acquired via importing, and counterfactual 1860 TFP drops to 85. And
remove cottona€”the only fiber the machines could work ona€”and counter actual 1860 TFP drops down 
to 75.

Thus we have a non-cotton economy TFP growing from 65 to 75a€”15%a€”from 1780 to 1860; a 
static-exports but cotton-using economy growing to 85a€”another 15%a€”from
1780 to 1860, and the historical export economy growing to 100a€’’another 23%. And throughout those 
80 years the population was growing from 8 to 20 million, creating
enormous food-resource scarcity at home that requires an export machine of previously unprecedented 
size.

I agree: this is not modern economic growth. But it is also not (merely) Dutch-style intensive 
agriculture and commerce, the caravel (although note that the caravela€™ s effects ex­
Europe were momentous, even genocidal, it was just its effects within Europe that were 
substantial-but-not-overwhelming), or printing (although Jeremiah Dittmar notes that
printing does not just make books cheap, but makes the knowledge engine-of-growth get in gear),

Gregory Clark: The Secret History of the Industrial Revolution'. a€~Other places in Europe in the 
years 1200 to 1760 saw similar episodes of productivity
growth that were as substantial as those in England from 1760 to 1860a€! between 1550 and 1650 the 
Netherlands saw significant productivity advance.

The appearance that the Industrial Revolution in England represented a decisive break from the past 
is largely a product of the unusual demographic
experience of England in the Industrial Revolution yearsa€! driving up land rentals and creating 
urbanization, spurreda€! changesa€! the enclosure of
common lands, improvements in transportation, the expansion of coal mining, and perhaps also the 
fall in interest ratesa€!
