WASHINGTON ROST

More (seasonally-adjusted) growth in employment than we had thought last winter and this late-fall 
and winter; less (seasonally-adjusted) growth in employment than we had thought last summer. And 
much more of an economy in which demand pressure ran into bottlenecks and showed up in rising 
prices rather than rising employment last summer than I had thought or than the numbers I was then 
seeing
validated.

And yet the whole round trip seems to leave us right now where I thought we were: still leaving 
rubber on the road as we rejoin the highway at speed, with the dominant feature of the situation 
being that we are rejoining the highway at speed and should be incredibly pleased at succeeding in 
doing so. Thus the most productive position for macroeconomic policy to take is to make sure we do 
rejoin the
highway at speed, and accept that the rubber we are currently leaving on the road as we do so is a 
necessary side-effect of a very good thinga€”not something to worry about right now.

The time to worry about inflation will be next year, when we are moving with the traffic. Then will 
be the time to look at the situation, look at the bond marketa€™ s inflation expectations, and 
decide whether any sort of monetary policy rA©gime reset is called for.
If there is an argument that I am wrong, please tell me. And please tell me what it is. But I do 
not see ita€!

Is Omicron intrinsically less severe than other variants? @BillHanage and I argue that it's still 
too early to say, despite what appear to be early signs of milder impact in SA than past waves.

Talking "Bretbug" in the Classroom

I taught the Bretbug case in my strategic political communication class this week. Ita€™ s weird 
teaching a case study where youa€™re the main protagonist. But it would be weirder not to teach it, 
I think. The Bretbug episode hits right at the center of a few themes from my class. Ita€™ s a 
classic example of a€oeconflict expansion.a€D It illustrates the way that ina€!

Thinking About the Garbage Pile-on Against Lisa Cooka€!

My student (in a small waya€”I joined the Berkeley faculty long after she had arrived for the Ph.D. 
program). Spellman College magna cum laude, a junior year abroad in Strasbourg, Truman Scholar, 
Oxford PPE, an M.A. from UniversitA© Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar, Ph.D. from Berkeley with a 
dissertation on credit markets in Russia, Assistant Professor at Harvarda€™ s Kennedy School, Senior
Advisor on Finance and Development to the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, three years at the Hoover 
Institution, Senior Economist at the Council of Economic Advisors as, among other things, the point 
person on the Eurozone-crisis phase of the Great Recession, MSU Professor, Deputy Team Lead for 
Finance on the Biden-Harris transition.

From my perspective, her big economic research hits are a€oeThe Green Books and the Geography of 
Segregation in Public Accommodationsa€U, a€oeRural Segregation and Racial Violence: Historical 
Effects of Spatial Racism,a€D a€oeA Green Light for Red Patents: New Evidence from Soviet 
Innovation Abroad, 1933 to 1991,a€D a€oeViolence and Economic Growth: Evidence from African
American Patents, 1870-1940,a€D a€oeOvercoming Discrimination by Consumers during the Age of 
Segregation: The Example of Garrett Morgan,a€D a€oelnventing Social Capital: Evidence from African 
American Inventors, 1843-1930,a€D Explorations in Economic History ,a€D and a€oeMetals or 
Management? Explaining Recent Economic Growth in Africaa€D. None of these were easy to write:
they  all involve a huge amount of data-intensive gruntwork, as opposed to turning on the computer, 
feeding it a bunch of numbers, and then printing out pretty graphs.

Perhaps most interesting of the things that she has written from the perspective of the waves of 
garbage that have landed on Lisa Cook this week is her 2004 a€oeThe Next Battleground in the Terror 
Wara€D 
<https://www.hoover.Org/research/next-battleground-terror-warhttps://www.hoover.org/research/next-ba
ttleground-terror-war>, from 2004, that she wrote for the Hoover Institution:

The war on terror has not been won in Africaa€!. Bringing stability to countries is one thing, but 
making democracy work in them is quite anothera€!. Underdeveloped and dysfunctional economies breed 
poverty and are prime breeding grounds for terroristsa€!. The Bush administration has extended and 
promoted programs such as the African Growth and Opportunity Acta€!.
The schedule for making more manufactured products from Africa available to American consumers 
needs to be speeded upa€! the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA)a€!. HIV/AIDS and other infectious 
diseases are having a devastating effecta€!. Finally, all the aforementioned peace talks and 
agreements encouraged and supported by the administration are fragilea€i.

Terrorism bred in distant failed states can eventually make its way back to us and to our allies. 
It is time to take Africaa€™ s problems seriouslya€!

I read this, and I think: if there still were a Jack Kemp wing of the Republican Party, I really 
could see Lisa Cook either in it or as a valued centrist partner of it. I can see the George W. 
Bush African-engagement policy group enthusiastically embracing Lisa Cook as well.

But in the modern American Republican Party and conservative movement, there is absolutely nothing 
any African-American can do to gain approvala€’’other than to let themselves be slotted into the 
role of an enthusiastic denouncer of "wokeness" in all of its forms. A John McWhorter can gaina€! 
not approval and respect, for that is beyond possibility, but a certain tolerancea€! with things 
like his Woke
Racism: How a New Religion Has Betrayed Black America 
<https://www.amazon.com/Woke-Racism-Religion-Betrayed-America-ebook/dp/B095JLK96B>.

Short of that, however, nothing else will gain you respect, or anything other than furious 
denunciations that, whatever you have managed to wrestle out of American society, it is much more 
than you deserve.
