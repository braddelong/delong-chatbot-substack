First:

The typical left-wing position on slavery back before the Industrial Revolution was, more or less: 
masters should treat their slaves well, because only chance and the wheel of fortune have made you 
the master and him the slavea€’’Plato, after all, was reputed to have been sold in the Aegina slave 
market for 20 minaea€”and while there may be some people who are slaves by nature, many are slaves 
against nature and only by convention. Even where the left­
wing position went beyond that, it tended to stop at a€oewe should not be slaves, or enslave others 
of usa€D where a€cewea€D are members of the tribe of Judah, or fellow Germans, French, or 
Englishmen. That slavery as an institution is repugnant to Natural Law and to Reason itselfa€”that 
was an overwhelming step that nearly nobody who wrote things down was willing to take. Peasants 
asked:

When Adam delved, and Eve span

Who was then the gentlemanl^D

But they were not participants in the debates of moral philosophy.

Why the literate used to believe that the peculiar institution was also a necessary institution is, 
I think clear. Under Malthusian or semi-Malthusian conditions, average productivity is going to be 
low. If you are going to have a literate, leisured class that aspires to a civilized life of 
refinement with the time to devote to philosophy, there have to be slaves to grow and serve them 
the food that they eat. Thus Aristotle:
If each of the tools were able to perform its function on command or by anticipation, as they 
assert those of Daedalus did, or the catering vessels of Hephaestus (which the poet says a€oeof 
their own accord came to the gods' gatheringa€n), so that shuttles would weave themselves and picks 
play the lyre, master craftsmen would no longer have a need for subordinates, or masters for 
slavesa€!

But, Aristotle presumed, we never had such and never would. And so outside the realm of fantasy 
slavery was a societal necessity.

If I were a cynical historical materialist, I would say that a blanket prohibition of slavery for 
all (rather than just for members of the in-group) as against Reason and the Law of Nature is a 
position that could only be seriously advanced, before the Industrial Revolution, by inhabitants of 
a commercial kingdom that bought massive amounts of the work of slaves from elsewherea€”that had 
the usufruct of slavery without formal ownership. Thus William
Blackstone:

William Blackstone (1753): Commentaries on the Laws of England'. a€~Pure and proper slavery does 
not, nav, cannot, subsist in England: such, I mean, wherebv an absolute and unlimited power is 
given to the master over the life and fortune of the slave. And indeed it is repugnant to reason, 
and the principles of natural law, that such a state should subsist anvwhere. The three origins of 
the right of slavery assigned bv Justinian are all of


them built upon false foundations.a€! Upon these principles the law of England abhors, and will not 
endure the existence of, slavery within this nation; so that when an attempt was made to introduce 
it, by statute 1 Edw. VI. c. 3a€! spirit of the nation could not brook thisa€! even in the most 
abandoned rogues; and therefore this statute was repealed in two years afterwards. And now it is 
laid down, that a slave or negro, the instant he
lands in England, becomes a freeman; that is, the law will protect him in the enjoyment of his 
person, and his propertya€!

ugnant-to-reason-and-the-principles-of-natural-law-and-that-it-has-no-place-in-english-law-1753>

And yet, and yet, after the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 the British Empire committed its 
battlefleet to the suppression of the slave trade worldwide. And yet, and yet, in 1833 the British 
Empire moved toward the abolition of slavery within its borders.

And yet, and yet, in 1776 Thomas Jefferson had planted a time-bomb in the founding of the United 
States: declaring it a self-evident truth held by those who called themselves Americans that all 
men were created equal, endowed with rights to life, liberty, anda€! something: hold property? 
pursue autonomy? pursue happiness? And that governments that did not secure these rights were 
illegitimate. Many tried to unwrite Jeffersona€™ s wordsa€”chief among
them pre-Civil War Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. But the words could not be 
unwritten. Jefferson may not have meant thema€’’Jefferson may have only wished to appear the kind 
of enlightened Enlightenment sage who could mean them, or wished but found himself unable to be the 
sage. However, what Jefferson the Virginian said when he meant it was less important than what the 
millions who read him heard the voice in the air that was
Thomas Jeffersons who lived in their imaginations.

And yet, and yet, over 1861-1865 400,000 young men, predominantly but far from exclusively white 
men, went south to sacrifice their blood and their lives to try to make that version of Thomas 
Jefferson and his 1776 words the controlling founding moment of America, rather than James Madison 
and company and their 1787 words of fussy and limited compromise, or Captain Jope of the White Lion 
and his 1619 sale at Jamestown of 20 enslaved who he had
found                                                                                               
                                                                                                    
            on board the Portuguese slave ship San Juan Bautista.

The historical materialist in me boggles at the early strength of the abolitionist movementa€”not 
just no slavery to be inflicted on us, but no slavery to be inflicted on anyone.

Kwame Anthony Appiah: Digging for Utopia'. a€~One question is how persuasive we find the booka€™ s 
intellectual history, which mainly unspools from the early Enlightenment to the macrohistorians of 
today and tells of how consequential truths about alternate social arrangements got hidden from 
view. Another is how persuasive we find the booka€™ s prehistory, in particular its parade of 
large-scale Neolithic communities that, Graeber and Wengrow
suspect, were self-governing and nondominatinga€!. Among its most arresting claims is that European 
intellectuals had no concept of social inequality before the seventeenth century because the 
concept was, effectively, a New World importa€!. This claim is plainly wide of the mark. Look 
south, and you find that Francisco de Vitoria (circa 1486a€“1546), like others of the School of 
Salamanca, had much to say about social inequality; and he, in turn, could cite
eminences like Gregory the Great, who in the sixth century insisted that all men were by nature 
equal, and that a€oeto wish to be feared by an equal is to lord it over others, contrary to the 
natural order.a€Da€! Graeber and Wengrow could be all wrong in their intellectual history, of 
course, and completely right about our Neolithic past. Yet their mode of argument leans heavily on 
a few rhetorical strategies. One is the bifurcation fallacy, in which we are
presented   with a false choice of two mutually exclusive alternativesa€!. Graeber and Wengrow tend 
to introduce a conjecture with the requisite qualifications, which then fall away, like scaffolding 
once a building has been erected. Discussing the Mesopotamian settlement of Uruk, they caution that 
anything said about its governance is speculation^!. Yet a hundred pages latera€! wea€™re assured 
that Uruk enjoyed a€oeat least seven centuries of collective

self-rule .&€□„, A reader who does the armchair archaeology of digging through the endnotes will 
repeatedly encountera€! discordance between what the book says and what its sources saya€!. 
A$atalhA5yAUka€!. You may still find yourself persuaded that a preponderance of nude women among 
depictions of gendered human bodies is, as Graeber and Wengrow think, evidence for a gynocentric 
society. Just be prepared to be flexible: when they discuss the
Bronze Age culture of Minoan Crete, the fact that only males are depicted in the nude will be taken 
as evidence for a gynocentric societya€!. Two half-truths, alas, do not make a truth, and neither 
do a thousanda€l. Human beings are riven with both royalist and regicidal impulses; we are prone to 
erect hierarchies and prone to topple them. We can be deeply cruel and deeply caringa€!. Facing 
forward, we can conduct our own experiments in living. We can
devise the stages wea€™ d like to see. Thata€™ s what Rousseau came to thinka€!. Never mind the 
dawn, he was urging: we will not find our future in our pasta€!

Jamelle Bouie: Bill Clinton, Race & the Politics of the 1990s: a€~Clinton concluded his remarks 
with a now-notorious denunciation of the rapper and activist Sister Souljah, an attack by proxy on 
Jackson, who had brought Souljah to the eventa€!. a€oeWhat Clinton got out of the Sister Souljah 
affair ,a€D noted the historian Kenneth Oa€™ Reilly, a€oewere votes, particularly the votes of the 
so-called Reagan Democrats like the North Philadelphia electrician
who said a€~the day he told off that [expletive] Jackson is the day he got [mine].a€™ a€Da€l If 
Shora€™ s analysis is correct, then this is what it could be like to change course. Progressives 
would complain, as they did in 1992, buta€”a proponent of this approach might saya€”Clinton still 
won 85 percent of the Black vote. And once in office, he would try to reverse course: to moderate 
and to show his commitment to the people who put him in the White
Housea€!. But there is no such thing as idle presidential rhetorica€!

Stephen Diehl: The Token Disconnect: a€~To the overwhelming majority of us in the software 
engineering profession who live closest to the metal, we see blockchain as a technology that barely 
works and whose use cases (if any) are vanishingly small and niche. Blockchains are a solution in 
search of a problem, but in the meantime wea€™re expected to pre-invest in a€oetokensa€D while the 
decades roll by with seemingly no progress on the fundamental
question of a€oeFor what?a€Da€l. If there is any innovation in crypto assets ita€™ s not in 
software engineering, but in financial engineering. Wea€™ ve created a new financial product like 
an option contract on a startup potentially building something real, but in case they dona€™t you 
can always exercise it early by simply dumping the stock on the public to cash out completely 
untethered to the companya€™ s success. You dona€™t need to file a Sa€“l

or have a coherent prospectus about attracting customers or business or revenue. Hell, the company 
doesna€™ t even have to have a business model at all, and in fact the best performing crypto assets 
are the ones that literally dona€™ t do anything at all. They just need to tell a good story. 
Whata€™ s even more appetizing about the crypto-token-as-equity-proxy scheme is that instead of 
having to wait a decade for an initial public offering to dump your shares
on the public, the shares can be made immediately liquid whenever you want, and you can dump the 
smoldering carcass of a a€oecompanya€D on the public markets directly without Wall Street getting 
their cut. Oh, and ita€™ s also like the 1920s again and you can insider trade, wash trade, and 
pump and dump and therea€™ s basically no enforcement. And in the rare case where there is 
enforcement the AG is probably only going to want the scalp of the
entrepreneur who ran the scheme, not their investors. In a way, good for them for figuring out this 
lucrative loophole in our system. But at the same time shame on them for exploiting this loophole 
because of its horrible externalities. At the most broad macro level, offering these unregistered 
securities on highly manipulated markets, on rails that you control, with no regulation or consumer 
protection means that your average fool from the public is getting taken
to    the absolute cleaners when buying these thingsa€!. With crypto wea€™ ve decided to do the 
most American thing ever, to commoditize our rage at the financial system into a financial product. 
Because after all, wea€™ re just temporarily embarrassed millionaires and the only problem with 
CDOs wasna€™ t the moral hazard, but that you didna€™ t have a piece of the action. This time you 
have a choice, but I suspect history is going to have the same lesson
to teach us about the perils of greed untempered by reasona€! a€™
