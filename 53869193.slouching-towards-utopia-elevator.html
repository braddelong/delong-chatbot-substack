Bradford DeLong</strong> (Sep. 6, 2022): <em>Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Long 20th Century, 1870-2010</em> (New York: Basic Books, ) &lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economic-History-Twentieth-Century/dp/0465019595/">https://www.amazon.com/Economic-History-Twentieth-Century/dp/0465019595/</a>&gt;:</p><p><em>Slouching Towards Utopia </em>is a book in the same class as Jared Diamond's&nbsp;<em>Guns, Germs, &amp; Steel</em>&nbsp;or Thomas Piketty's&nbsp;<em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The theme of Diamond’s&nbsp;<em>Guns</em>—a brilliant book, if not without its major flaws (and what things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)—is: Civilizations in different places had access to different plant and animal resources, and for developing bio and other technologies two heads are better than one. Within Eurasia at the last the Atlantic Seaboard led in agricultural wealth and hence first developed the steel and the guns. Plus Eurasians gained immunity to all the germs that jumped from Eurasian animals into humans. And everything else follows from those Atlantic-Seaboard differential advantages with respect to guns, germs, and steel.&nbsp;</p><p>The theme of Piketty’s&nbsp;<em>Capital</em>—a brilliant book, if not without its major flaws (and what things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)—is: Capitalists control enough political levers to keep the profit rate around 5%, faster than economies grow. Only in exceptional eras of wars, revolutions, deep depressions, and the short post-WWII social-democractic age of very rapid growth will wealth at the top fail to outpace wealth in general. Hence in normal times income and wealth inequality is either already very high already or is rising fast. And everything else follows from that tendency toward high inequality.</p><p>The theme of&nbsp;<em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em>—a brilliant book, if not without its major flaws (and what things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)<em>—</em>is this:</p><p>The long 20th century—the first whose history was primarily&nbsp;<em>economic</em>, with the economy not painted scene-backdrop but rather revolutionizing humanity's life every single generation— taught humanity expensive lessons. In 1870 industrial research labs, modern corporations, globalization, and the market economy—which, as that genius Friedrich von Hayek most keen-sightedly observed, is tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutions—proved keys to the lock that had kept humanity in its desperately poor iron cage, with the only comfortable ones being the thugs with spears who took from the near-subsistence farmers, and those with whom they shared their extractions. And previously unimaginable economic growth revolutionized human life over and over, generation by generation.</p><p>We should, thereafter, have straightforwardly turned our technological power and wealth to building something very close to a utopia: a truly human world. From 1870-2010 was 140 years. Few in 1870 would have doubted that humanity more than ten times richer in material terms would build ourselves a utopia.</p><p>So what has gone wrong? Well, that idiot Friedrich von Hayek thought the unleashed market would do the whole job: “the market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the market”. But, as that genius Karl Polanyi put it: people will not stand for being told that there are no rights but property rights. They instead insist that “the market was made for man, not man for the market”. The market’s treating those whom society saw as equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought social explosion after explosion, blocking the road to utopia. They deserved communities, incomes, and stability. They needed their Polanyian rights to those things vindicated too.</p><p>Since 1870 humans—Theodore Roosevelt, John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Vladimir Lenin, Margaret Thatcher, Deng Xiaoping, and others— tried to think up solutions. They dissented from “the market giveth…” constructively and destructively. The demanded that the market do less, or different, and other institutions do more.&nbsp;</p><p>Only with a shotgun marriage of von Hayek’s market to Polanyi’ society, a marriage blessed by Keynes—a marriage that itself has so far failed its own&nbsp; sustainability tests—have we been able to even slouch towards utopia, and bring the El Dorado of a truly human world into view.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether we ever justify the full bill run up over the 140 years from 1870 to 2010 will likely depend on whether we remember and act upon that lesson.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/slouching-towards-utopia-elevator?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/slouching-towards-utopia-elevator?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Polanyi, Keynes, von Hayek:</h3><p>The book wound up with a Polanyi-Left Neoliberal grand narrative:</p><p>The frozen glacial creep of economic history came to an end in 1870. The ice had been cracking beforehand, but as of 1870 it all melted, and the torrent began. Every single generation after 1870 technological change was so fast that the economy revolutionized itself in a generation, and then did so again, every single generation, at least until 2010. (After which, a new story **may** have begun.) And the repeated, sequential, Schumpeterian creative-destruction economic revolutions meant that all was solid melted into air—all established patterns and orders were steamed away—and while men (and women) were not compelled to face with sober senses their real conditions of life and relations with one another, they did have to try to build new institutions to manage the problems and opportunities of production, distribution, and utilization that the onrushing technological cornucopia brought.<br><br>Von Hayek said that the market economy could produce unequal prosperity, but nothing more: trying to shape and manage it to produce social justice as well would fail, destroy prosperity, and put us on the road to, well, serfdom; and so the watchword had to be "the market giveth, the market taketh away, blessed be the name of the market".<br><br>Keynes whimpered that if only governments allowed his technocratic students to conduct a sensible monetary policy along with a "somewhat comprehensive" socialization of investment, that everyone would have a job and technology plus compound interest would wreak marvels and rock-bottom interest rates would "euthanize" the rentiers—so that they could use their money social power only at the cost of spending down their capital, and so relinquishing it. Thus in the not-very-long-run, Keynesian technocrats could solve the problems of production and distribution, leaving humanity to grapple with its real problem: that of utilization of our wealth to create a truly human world.<br><br>Polanyi said that the "stark utopia" of von Hayek's market was unsustainable: the only rights it recognized were property rights and your own source of social power was your wealth, but people thought that they had other, more important, rights that society needed to vindicate—to economic security, to an income level proportional to what they deserved, that other people should have income levels proportional to what <em><strong>they deserved</strong></em> too, in a connected society that gave them respect and place—plus that you should have some&nbsp; power in society even if you had no wealth. Political economists who did not recognize this and tried to bring the stark utopia of market society would thus face explosions, and be overwhelmed by social-political movements that sought social justice—which might be a very inegalitarian kind of social justice, because it would give people not equal shares but rather what those making the rules <em><strong>deserved</strong></em>.<br><br>The closest the whole thing came to holding together was the post-WWII era of social democracy, in which Keynesian focus on full employment (and low interest rates to make amortizing the WWII-era debt easy), Beveridgian equality-through-redistribution (and public provision), plus a little Pigovian externality-compensation produced the Thirty Glorious Years. But somehow social democracy failed its sustainability test, and was replaced by neoliberalism, which stubbornly persists in spite of its failure to fulfill any of its promises except that it would make the rich much richer with much more social power.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Alternative Grand Narratives:</h3><p>In the beginning, the book was going to have a number of important threads. It was to be a science-and-technology book—a Michael Polanyi book. It was going to be an engineers-and-entrepreneurs book. It was going to be a Schumpeterian creative-destruction-and-finance book. It was going to be a Keynesian macro-and-moral-philosophy book. And it was going to be a reacting-to-“Red-Vienna” book—a Karl Polanyi-and-friends book.</p><p>Of all of these Grand Narratives that I had originally hoped to thread throughout the book, only the last of these—the Karl Polanyi Grand Narrative—survived the writing and editing process.</p><p> That means that my aspirations for the book have shrunk: my hope now is that my book will do for Karl Polanyi something like what Charlie Kindleberger’s <em>Manias, Panics, and Crashes</em> did for Hyman Minsky—that is, make him comprehensible, arresting, immediate, and important, by providing lots of narrative examples for which the underlying theory can serve as a thematic lens.</p><p>Why are not the good people of the global north happier and more satisfied with the techno-utopian marvels that have been delivered to them? Why has great wealth in historical perspective produced not reduced but increased economic anxiety? And how does that economic anxiety get transformed into ethno-nationalist fear and rage? And how is it that the neoliberal ordering of society still survives, given that it has fulfilled <em><strong>exactly</strong></em> <em><strong>none</strong></em> of the promises made by its original salesmen, save for making the rich richer and society more economically unequal?</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/slouching-towards-utopia-elevator/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/slouching-towards-utopia-elevator/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>30 Words:</h3><p>Only when Keynes blessed the shotgun marriage of von Hayek’s market and Polanyi’s society did 20th-century humanity even slouch towards utopia.

The most important of them is this: Only a shotgun marriage of Friedrich von Hayek to Karl Polanyi, a marriage blessed by John Maynard Keynes—a marriage that itself has failed its own sustainability tests—has humanity been able to even slouch towards the utopia that the explosion of our science and technological competence ought to have made our birthright. Whether we ever justify the full bill run up over the 146 years from 1870 to 2016 will likely depend on whether we remember that lesson.</p><p>Friedrich von Hayek—a genius—was the one who most keen-sightedly observed that the market economy is tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutions. The market economy, plus industrial research labs, modern corporations, and globalization, were keys to the cage keeping humanity desperately poor. Hayek drew from this the conclusion: “the market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the market.” Humans disagreed. As genius Karl Polanyi saw, humans needed more rights than just property rights. The market’s treating those whom society saw as equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought social explosion after explosion, blocking the road to utopia.</p><p>Not “blessed be the name of the market” but “the market was made for man, not man for the market” was required if humanity was to even&nbsp; slouch towards utopia that technology and potential material abundance ought to have made straightforward to reach. But how? Since 1870 humans—John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Vladimir Lenin, and others—have tried solutions, demanding that the market do less, or different, and other institutions do more. Only government, tamed government, focusing and rebalancing things to secure more and different rights for more citizens have brought the El Dorado of a truly human world into view.</p><div><hr></div><h3>2022-05-16:</h3><p>Start with the metaphor of the economic pie, and with the society-scale problems of baking, slicing and tasting. First you have a bake a large-enough pie—a pie so that there is potentially <em><strong>enough</strong></em> for all. Then you have to slice the pie—so everyone gets their share. Then people have to taste the pie—use their material resources to live a good life—be healthy, safe, secure, and happy.</p><p>Before 1870 the human technological level and ability to harvest natural resources was low relative to our population. Humanity could not even bake a large-enough pie. After 1870 things changed. Advancing science, turned into technology by industrial research labs, deployed at scale by modern corporations, and then diffused throughout the world by that magnificent crowdsourcing mechanism that is the market economy solved the problem of baking what every previous era would have seen as <em><strong>enough</strong></em>. And—since they saw the baking as the hard problem—they would be very surprised to see that the problems of slicing and tasting have flummoxed us. They would expect us to live in utopia, as we manifestly do not.</p><p>My <em>Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History &nbsp;of the 20th Century</em> is about how we solved the problem of baking the pie—and how we fumbled the solution to the problems of slicing and tasting. That is its big narrative sweep, with lots of subthreads, digressions, and anecdotes along the way.</p><p><em><strong>What happened?</strong></em> This, I think, my book has nailed. Letting the market economy rip to solve the problem of making <em><strong>enough</strong></em><strong> </strong>had consequences. You see, the only rights the market economy recognizes are property rights; and the only gospel it preaches is "the market giveth; the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the market".</p><p>People will not, and did not, stand for that. They demand, instead: “the market was made for man; not man for the market”.</p><p>Perhaps humanity, came close to an institutional-societal setup to tackle the problems of slicing and tasting. Post-WWII "social democracy" in the rich countries was a good try.

A typical century would see technology advance by little. Perhaps the the population at the end of the century could have lived 5% better than those at the start—if the population had stayed the same. But Malthusian forces were dominant. The only way for women to have durable social power was to be the mothers of surviving sons, and even with high fertility more than a quarter saw all their sons die, so better nutrition would lead them to try harder. Thus the population grew by 10% in an average century, and so smaller farm sizes offset better technology and kept the real income of the typical human much the same. And so human psychology, human sociology, and human polities stayed much the same, with substantial changes visible only if one took the long-duration viewpoint of millennia.</p><p>This frozen glacial creep of economic history came to an end in 1870. The ice had been cracking beforehand, over 1500 to 1870. But after 1870 saw the roaring of the cataract. In every single generation after 1870 technological change was so fast and the seizing of opportunities by the market economy so rapid that the economy revolutionized itself in a generation, and then did so again, every single generation. This was the story at least until 2010. (After which, a new story <em><strong>may</strong></em> have begun.)</p><p>Te repeated, sequential, Schumpeterian creative-destruction economic revolutions meant that all was solid melted into air—all established patterns and orders were steamed away—and while men (and women) were not compelled to face with sober senses their real conditions of life and relations with one another, they did have to try to build new institutions to manage the problems and opportunities of production, distribution, and utilization that the onrushing technological cornucopia brought.</p><p>Friedrich von Hayek said that the market economy could produce unequal prosperity, but nothing more: trying to shape and manage it to produce social justice as well would fail, destroy prosperity, and put us on the road to, well, serfdom; and so the watchword had to be "the market giveth, the market taketh away, blessed be the name of the market".</p><p>John Maynard Keynes whimpered that if only governments allowed his technocratic students to conduct a sensible monetary policy along with a "somewhat comprehensive" socialization of investment, that everyone would have a job and technology plus compound interest would wreak marvels and rock-bottom interest rates would "euthanize" the rentiers—so that they could use their money social power only at the cost of spending down their capital, and so relinquishing it. Thus in the not-very-long-run, Keynesian technocrats could solve the problems of production and distribution, leaving humanity to grapple with its real problem: that of utilization of our wealth to create a truly human world.</p><p>Karl Polanyi said that the "stark utopia" of von Hayek's market was unsustainable: the only rights it recognized were property rights and your own source of social power was your wealth, but people thought that they had other, more important, rights that society needed to vindicate—to economic security, to an income level proportional to what they <em><strong>deserved</strong></em>, and that other people should have income levels proportional to what <em><strong>they</strong></em> deserved<em><strong> </strong></em>too, in a connected society that gave them respect and place—plus that you should have some&nbsp; power in society even if you had no wealth. Political economists who did not recognize this and tried to bring the stark utopia of market society would thus face explosions, and be overwhelmed by social-political movements that sought social justice—which might be a very inegalitarian kind of social justice indeed, because it would give people not equal shares but rather what those making the rules <em><strong>deserved</strong></em>.</p><p>The closest the whole thing came to holding together was the post-WWII era of social democracy, in which Keynesian focus on full employment (and low interest rates to make amortizing the WWII-era debt easy), Beveridgian equality-through-redistribution (and public provision), plus a little Pigovian externality-compensation produced the Thirty Glorious Years. But somehow social democracy failed its sustainability test, and was replaced by neoliberalism, which stubbornly persists in spite of its failure to fulfill any of its promises except that it would make the rich much richer with much more social power.</p><div><hr></div><h3>2022-06-11:</h3><p>The long 20th century was the first whose history was primarily&nbsp;<em>economic</em>, with the economy not painted scene-backdrop but rather revolutionizing humanity's life every single generation with massive, creative and destructive, utopian and immiserating upward leaps in technology-driven productivity. Before 1870 humanity had thought that the big problem was that it could not bake a big enough pie: given limited technology and natural resources relative to population, human production could not be large enough for everyone to have <em><strong>enough.</strong></em><strong> </strong>In the long twentieth century that constraint fell away. The pie could be baked. But better technology did not help solve the problems of slicing and tasting the pie: as of today, having <em><strong>enough</strong></em><strong> </strong>remains out-of-reach for most of humanity. And those with <em><strong>enough</strong></em> have a hard time properly tasting it: many (most?) of them do not look healthy, safe, secure, and happy.<strong> </strong></p><p>Only when the political-economic order was the post-WWII North-Atlantic social-democratic shotgun marriage of Friedrich von Hayek to Karl Polanyi, a marriage blessed by John Maynard Keynes—a marriage that itself has failed its own sustainability tests when it ran into the buzzsaw of the neoliberal challenge in the 1980s—has humanity been able to even slouch towards utopia. The explosion of our science and technological competence ought to have made our birthright. Yet we have, in many aspects, sold it for thin red-lentil stew.</p><p>Friedrich von Hayek—a genius, in some ways—was the one who most keen-sightedly observed that the market economy is tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutions. The market economy, plus industrial research labs, modern corporations, and globalization, were keys to the cage keeping humanity desperately poor. Hayek drew from this the conclusion: “the market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the market.” And he said that attitude was necessary to grasp as much of utopia as humanity could grasp. But humans disagreed. As genius Karl Polanyi saw, humans needed more rights than just property rights. The market’s treating those whom society saw as equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought social explosion after explosion, blocking the road to utopia.</p><p>Not “blessed be the name of the market” but “the market was made for man, not man for the market” was required if humanity was to even slouch towards the utopia that we ought to  grasp with our technology. But how? Since 1870 humans—John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Vladimir Lenin, and many others—have tried solutions, demanding that the market do less, or different, and other institutions do more, or other. Only government, tamed government, focusing and rebalancing things to secure more and different rights for more citizens, have brought the El Dorado of a truly human world into view. If electorates could choose such governments, slicing and tasting the pie ought to be problems as solvable as baking the pie turned out to be. But the twentieth century taught us—painfully—that that is not easy. And is it even possible?</p><p>As John Maynard Keynes wrote way back in 1924:</p><blockquote><p>We lack, more than usual a coherent scheme of progress, a tangible ideal....
