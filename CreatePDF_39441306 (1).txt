There was, in the White House, a person without an agency stake in the outcome charged with 
coordinating disparate domestic-policy advice: Stu Eizenstat. Eizenstat was in the White House, 
physically. Treasury Secretaries
Blumenthal and Miller were not. If Eizenstat was overwhelmeda€”as he wasa€”he should have called 
for more assistants, or for a peer.

26) As late as 2016, Stanford Universitya€™ s Hoover Institution was paying ex-University of 
Chicago finance professor John Cochrane to write articles about how a proper neoliberal dismantling 
of social-democratic
regulation to achieve legal and regulatory simplification would, if it had been carried out over 
the previous generation, have already boosted American incomes by a factor of 8, from $50,000 to 
$400,000 per capita per year.
And  the Wall Street Journal was publishing them: John H. Cochrane, a€oeEnding Americaa€™ s 
Siow-Growth Tailspin: The U.S. Economy Needs a Dramatic Legal and Regulatory Simplificationa€D, 
Wall Street Journal
May 2,2016 <https:// www.wsj.com/articles/ending-americas-slow-growth-tailspin-1462230818>. The 
idea was that 100% of the correlation between ordinal indices of a€oegovernance qualitya€D and real 
income per capita
was a causal log-linear relationship with the index as the cause that could be projected 
outof-sample, that the United States could easily attain best-practice in a€oegovernance 
qualitya€Da€”an ordinal index value of 100a€”
and then it would be straightforward to push a€oegovernance qualitya€D up to 120 by deregulation,
