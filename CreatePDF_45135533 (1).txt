We humans are an anthology intelligence both with respect to knowledge and information and with 
respect to work and production. Put the one side are we manage ourselves in the realm of thought. 
How do we manage ourselves in the realm of work and production? Or, rather, how does each of us try 
to tune our by-now extremely sophisticated and fine division of labor so that
we can accomplish our own purposes?

Well, basically, there are three ways that we can appropriate for ourselves things out of the 
common pool created by our extremely sophisticated division of labor in production and work. We can 
do so by force, by fraud, or by win-win exchange. Which of those we choose is determined by how 
much we regard ourselves as invested in the well-being of others, how much effort
each of these modes of action is for us, and how valuable is the work of those whose efforts we are 
trying to control and appropriate. When something becomes or when someonea€™ s work becomes more 
valuable, it is worth more of our energy to appropriated’’and this can either be good or bad for 
those who make all the valuable things, depending:

James Davis Nicoll: Five SFF Books in Which Valuable Is Not the Same as Powerful: d~The use of the 
word doecommoditydn underlines an unfortunate truth: valuable is not the same as powerful. One 
might think a particular class of person having a monopoly on an economically vital activity would 
make them powerful. Nod”it makes whoever
controls them powerful. A quick glance at history shows many, many cases where considerable force 
was used to compel useful people to perform necessary services for little to no reward, from manual 
labour to reproduction. Perhaps SPId™ s background, were it to be further detailed, would show 
powerful women dominating galactic politicsdibut
itd™  s just as likely that telesthetic women are traded, controlled, and denied personal autonomy. 
Perhaps some fictional examples are in orderd!. Red Moon and Black Mountain by Joy Chant (1970)d!. 
Wild Seed by Octavia E. Butler (1980)d!. Caverns by Kevin Od™ Donnell, Jr. (1981)d!. A Heroine of 
the World by Tanith Lee (1989)d!. The
Beautiful Ones by Silvia Moreno-Garcia (2017)d!

Forthcoming September 6,2022, from Basic Books:

Slouching Towards Utopia: A History of the Long Twentieth Century. Paragraph 4: Histories of 
centuries, long or short, are by definition grand narrative histories, built to tell the authora€™ 
s desired story. Setting these years, 1914a€“1991, apart as a century makes it easy for Hobsbawm to 
tell the story he wants to tell. But it does so at the price of missing much of what I
strongly believe is the bigger, more important story. It is the one that runs from about 1870 to 
2010, from humanitya€™ s success in unlocking the gate that had kept it in dire poverty, up to 
humanitya€™ s failure to maintain the pace of the rapid upward trajectory in human technological 
competence and wealth that the earlier success had set in motion.

The History of Economic History: Part I

In the beginning, there was nothing. Then, there was candlelight. Economic history was born 
alongside academic economics in the late nineteenth century, a small part of a broader process: the 
formation of the modern university. Harvarda€™ s first chair in economic history was William J. 
Ashley, a British scholar who received the post in 1892, a few years bea€!

Matthew Yglesias: The CDCa€™s Vaccine Data Is All Wrong: a€~the answer to the riddle a€oeWhy is the 
CDCa€™ s vaccination count so bad?a€D turns out to be that actually nobody is counting. In the 
footnotes, they explain that they receive data that has been de-identified for privacy purposes, 
and consequently, you may be reported to them as two separate individuals if
you get different doses from different providers. They also explain that not everyone has county of 
residence information, which is why the county-level counts aggregate up to a lower number than the 
state-level count. Then, in a methodological choice that I think was a mistake, they top code 
everything at 99.9% on the theory that a€oethis cap helps address potential
overestimates of vaccination coverage due to first, second, and booster doses that were not 
linked.a€D This top-coding lets the CDC avoid saying absurd things like 117% of the senior citizens 
in Montgomery County are vaccinated. But by doing so, they are obscuring the underlying flaws in 
the dataa€!

Slow Boring

The CPC's vaccine data is all wrong

As Florida experienced its very deadly Delta wave, the volume of deaths and hospitalizations there 
seemed inconsistent with the statea€™ s superficially average levels of vaccination. But as David 
Wallace-Wells pointed out, the official data actually a€oesuggested in some places considerably 
more than 100 percent of local residents were vaccinated there, in some cases 200
percent of local residents.a€D Smart people on the internet swiftly reached a consensus that this 
reflected the miscounting of seasonal residents or vaccine tourists. After all, before Ron 
DeSantisa€™ political instincts led him to his current quasi-anti-vax posture, he was an early 
advocate of a more open, less bureaucratic approach to vaccine allocation. That meant a€oehead to
Florida to get a shota€D seemed like a plausible option for a lot of affluent, vax-enthusiastic 
peoplea€!

John Ganz: The Political Economy of Reaction'. a€~De Boer actually hits the nail on the head when 
he points out how lucrative involvement in these sorts of provocations is for him: he describes 
getting many more subscribers when he inserts himself into some media fracasa€!. It is possible to 
make a living, even to be quite successful and gain a degree of fame or intellectual
legitimacy and recognition in mediums like podcasts and newsletters, but the threat of irrelevance 
and obscurity hangs over the cultural producer and the need to publicize, to reach new publics and 
markets is ever-presenta€!. Being involved in some public outrage is a very quick and effective 
form of publicitya€!. This connection between journalism, theatricality, and cultural
politics feels very familiar to me from reading about the 19th and 20th centurya€!. I recently 
recommended Philip Norda€™ s The Politics of Resentment: Shopkeeper Protest in Nineteenth-Century 
Paris and his description of the dynamics of the literary culture of the Third Republic feels 
appositea€!. It is surely possible for someone to find something louche and romantic in all
this,

kind of revolt or radicalism, but to any clearsighted observer, ita€™ s all pretty dingya€!

Timothy Snyder: Lesson 12: Make Eye Contact & Small Talk: a€~This is the one that has aroused the 
most comment over the years. I take it that this is because it reminds us just how small-scale 
politics can be, and calls upon us to do something that seems ever more strange as we retreat into 
groups. It does not seem like much of a challenge, but it is a challenge. It is also, if it
comes to that, a form of self-defensea€!. This is not just polite. It is part of being a citizen 
and a responsible member of society. It is also a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, 
break down social barriers, and understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a 
culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily lifea€!
