In the past three years the advance of technology has provided about one percentage point of 
warranted real wage growth each yeara€”half, admittedly, of its pace in the Old Days, but still 
something. Yet real wages right now are four percent below their values of the fall of 2018. Does 
that sound like a a€cehigh-pressurea€D labor market to you?
Believers that the labor market is in some sense a€cetighta€D respond by pointing to the Employment 
Cost Index: up now some 4.5 percent from its value a year ago, 1.5 percentage points per year 
faster than the 3 percent per year rate-of-growth it had settled into in the pre-plague Trump 
administration years.

But the Consumer Price Index is up 5.4 percent from a year ago: the ECI-basis real wage has fallen 
by 0.9 percent over the past year. Does that, really, sound like a a€cetighta€D and a a€oehigh 
pressurea€D labor market to you?

We do not, right now, have too much money chasing too-few goods leading to an inflation 
spiral-provoking overdemand for labor. This is the case even though the plague continues, and its 
associated disruptions continue to give us a substantial undersupply of labor: women are 5, 
African-Americans 4.5, blue-collar workers 4, and the economy as a whole 3 percentage-points below 
what we used to see as the full-employment level of the employment-to-
population ratio. In a high-pressure economy with a tight labor market, workersa€™ bargaining power 
would be strong enough to get them real wage increases.

Yet economists I respect talk as if the economy is in serious inflationary trouble. Jason Furman 
speaks of how the a€oeoriginal sin was an oversized [Biden] American Rescue Plana€D. In his view, 
it would have been better to have been less aggressive and had a slower employment and growth 
recovery this year, for the ARP he sees as oversized a€ recontributed both to higher output but 
also higher pricesa€D, and Larry Summers thinks that, in Jim
Tankersleya€™ s paraphrase, a€oeinflation now risks spiraling out of controla€D chttps 
://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/business/economy/biden-inflation.html>.

The next move in the argumentative chess game is to say that the plague years have permanently 
damaged the supply-side of the economy: caused a lot of early retirements, and disrupted 
permanently the lean-and-mean supply chains on which a good deal of productivity and prosperity had 
depended. Perhaps. But the same arguments were made in the early 2010s, as an excuse justifying 
policies that did not put the pedal-to-the-metal and attempt to rapidly
reemploy those than called a€oezero-marginal-producta€n workers 
chttps://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/07/zero-marginal-product-workers.html>. One 
consequence of not putting the pedal-to-the-metal was Donald Trump, his rise fueled by the rage of 
those who saw the system as caring more about immigrants and minorities than it did out of 
blue-collar workers whose opportunities had never recovered to the pre-2008 normal. Putting
restoring full employment at the back of the bus of onea€™ s priorities is not just un-woke because 
of its disproportionate effect on minorities, it adds to the dangers to and difficulties of 
democracy as well.

There is a last move in the argumentative chess game: the claim that whether or not the labor 
market is a€retighta€D, inflationa€’’whether supply- or demand-side drivena€”is high and salient 
enough that it will be rapidly incorporated into expectations. Thus the snake has to be scotched 
now while it is small, rather than dealing with it postponed until it hath fed further upon meat. 
Yet to date inflation has not been incorporated into the patterns of any of the
a€oesticky pricea€D in the economy, at least not according to the measure constructed by the 
Atlantic Federal Reserve chttps ://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CORESTICKM 159SFRBATL>.

And while the financial marketa€™ s 30-year inflation breakeven is more than half a percentage 
point above where it settled in the second half of the 2010s 
<https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T30YIEM>, it is still only at 2.35%: where it had settled in 
the first half of the 2010s, and slightly below the level that would be consistent with the Federal 
Reservea€™ s 2%/year PCE-Deflator inflation target.

With the inflation we see highly likely to bea€”perhaps others would say a€ceprobablya€D or even 
a€cearguablya€D, but I call them as I see thema€”simply rubber-on-the-road from recovery, with no 
sign that inflation has yet been incorporated into those prices in the economy that are sticky, 
with the labor market still weak enough that workers are unable to demand substantial increases in 
real wages, with financial markets blasA© about the possibility of
rising inflation, and with a substantial fiscal contraction already in traina€”why would anybody 
argue that they know that the a€oeoriginal sina€D was the a€oeoversized American Recovery Plana€D, 
and that tightening monetary policy starting right now is the proper way to expiate this original 
sin?

Yet people do. People are. I cannot say that I follow the logic here.

Why So Much Premature Fear of an Inflationary Spiral?

2021-11-02

Video of my Project Syndicate column for November, 2021. Everything I see still points to our 
inflation as not a durable and troubling spiral but simply proper and appropriate: rubber left on 
the road as we rejoin highway traffic at speed. I do not understand what many who say otherwise are 
thinking.
