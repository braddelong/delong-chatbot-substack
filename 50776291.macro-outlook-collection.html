One was the World War II inflation—cut off by price controls. Then came the post-WWII structural-rebalancing-and-pent up demand inflation, and then the Korean War structural-rebalancing inflation as the U.S. government wheeled its economy to fight the Cold War. During both the Fed sat by—it was then still focused on keeping the prices of Treasury bonds high. The inflations soon passed away.</p><p>Before those came the World War I episode. That episode of inflation was cut off by an increase in the discount rate from 3.75%/year to 7%/year, which not only ended the inflation but enforced deflation: a 20% decline in the price level from its peak. (This decline, I should ask, made the task of restoring the gold standard at anything like pre-World War I nominal parities much more difficult, hence much more pointless.) Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz judged that the rise was “not only too late but also too much” &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/monetaryhistoryo0000frie/page/230/">https://archive.org/details/monetaryhistoryo0000frie/page/230/</a>&gt;: the Fed should have moved earlier to prevent excessive bank discounts from inappropriately boosting high-powered money, and at the moment the Fed did move the structure of credit was sufficiently based on a continuation of Fed policy that the Fed’s move generated “one of the most rapid declines [in economic activity] on record”.</p><p>If the Federal Reserve had not moved to raise discount rates after World War I, what would have happened? Friedman and Schwartz’s judgment is that an earlier increase of, say, 125 basis points to remove the incentive for banks to engage in excessive discounts would have brought the excessive growth of the high-powered money stock to an end, and stopped the inflation.</p><p>Then came the 1970s: The Fed raised interest rates after the Yom Kippur War oil shock to control inflation; then, after inflation peaked, it lowered them to try to restore full employment; then came the year when, as the late Charlie Schultze said, “our forecasts of nominal income growth were dead on, but inflation came in 2%-points high and real growth 2%-points low”; and then came the Volcker disinflation, reversed in September 1982 when they realized that they had bankrupted Mexico, and not resumed as the Fed decided to declare a fall in inflation to the 4-5%/year range as complete victory. That 4-5% target lasted for a decade, followed by the opportunistic disinflation down to and Alan Greenspan’s declaration of the 2%/year inflation target—a declaration that it is very hard today to argue was appropriate, given the extraordinary amount of time global north economies have spent with interest rates at their zero lower bound since.</p><p>What does macroeconomic theory tell us that the Federal Reserve should do now, in the spring of 2022?</p><p>Olivier Blanchard writes:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>In early 1975, core inflation was running at 12 percent and the real policy rate was equal to about −6 percent, a gap of about 17 percent. Today, core inflation is running at 6 percent and the real policy rate is equal to −6 percent, a gap of 12 percent—smaller than in 1975, but still strikingly large…. It then took 8 years, from 1975 to 1983, to reduce inflation to 4 percent, with an increase in the real rate from bottom to peak of close to 1,300 basis points, and a peak increase in the unemployment rate of 600 basis points from the early 1970s. Today is obviously different in many ways…. [But even so,] it reasonable to think that a 200-basis-point increase in the policy rate, so only 1/6 of the rate increase from 1975 to 1981, will do the job this time when the gap between core inflation and the policy rate is 2/3 of what it was in 1975? And that unemployment will barely budge? I wish I could believe it… &lt;<a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/why-i-worry-about-inflation-interest-rates-and-unemployment">https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/why-i-worry-about-inflation-interest-rates-and-unemployment</a>&gt;</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The suggestion seems to be that we have today 2/3 of the problem we had in 1975, and so the solution would be to do 2/3 as much—to raise interest rates by 800 basis points, 8% points—but then to apply some haircut to that 800 basis-point interest-rate rise because “today is obviously different in many ways”.</p><p>But why does he pick 1975-1983, rather than 1951 or 1948 or 1920? Does economic theory tell him to do so?</p><p><em><strong>Truth be told, there is no economic theory</strong></em>. There is only history, and its events, and analogies we make based on judgments concerning complicated emergent processes we do not understand very well that come out of the millions of interactions that are the economy. Sometimes, it is true, we distill and crystallize the history into something we call theory where little squiggles that look like ɣ, δ, β, σ, and so on; we then mainline the crystallized product. After mainlining it we can think we know something. But after mainlining crystal meth we experience increased energy, elevated mood, extraordinary confidence, racing thoughts, muscle twitches, and rapid breathing, among other things.</p><p>Move cautiously. Be data-dependent. Wait for it to become clearer which, if any, historical analogies are relevant to our situation. And always, always, always remember that in an economy that is near and that we have a good reason to fear will long remain in danger of hitting the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, premature and excessively aggressive moves that raise interest rates cannot easily be corrected.</p><h2>First: No, the Fed Is Not (Far) Behind the Curve!</h2><p>Here is a reason I do not think that the Fed is (far) behind the curve:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb25cd211-acc4-4c57-a223-f0edd336fde2_1266x994.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb25cd211-acc4-4c57-a223-f0edd336fde2_1266x994.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb25cd211-acc4-4c57-a223-f0edd336fde2_1266x994.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb25cd211-acc4-4c57-a223-f0edd336fde2_1266x994.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb25cd211-acc4-4c57-a223-f0edd336fde2_1266x994.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b25cd211-acc4-4c57-a223-f0edd336fde2_1266x994.png" width="1266" height="994" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b25cd211-acc4-4c57-a223-f0edd336fde2_1266x994.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:994,&quot;width&quot;:1266,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:655321,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb25cd211-acc4-4c57-a223-f0edd336fde2_1266x994.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb25cd211-acc4-4c57-a223-f0edd336fde2_1266x994.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb25cd211-acc4-4c57-a223-f0edd336fde2_1266x994.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb25cd211-acc4-4c57-a223-f0edd336fde2_1266x994.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>It seems highly likely that at least the manufacturing part of the economy will slow markedly over the next 1 1/2 years, no?</p><p>And that is with what the Fed has already done (and is expected to do).

We have a target: inflation from five to ten years out. We have an instrument: the current level and planned forward path for the Fed Funds rate. We have a reading on whether we are on a glide path to the target—the bond market’s 5-year, 5-year forward expected inflation rate.

The Fed may have to raise interest rates by more than 200 basis points. The Phillips Curve may well shift.

There is now a better than even chance that the US economy faces something like stagflation over the next two years. I think the odds are that the economy could have ridden out Xi Jinping's attempts to deal with omicron while maintaining his "Covid zero" policy, but add onto this the war in Ukraine and its effect on world energy and food prices, and the feds ability to thread the needle looks much much weaker:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Noah Smith</strong>: <em>China, Russia, &amp; the Inflation Situation</em>: ‘Neil Irwin tweeted… “We’re currently living in the brief moment between when Finance/Econ Twitter has realized that the new Covid lockdowns in Shenzhen are going to have hugely bad consequences for US inflation, but that has not yet become a widely-reported conventional wisdom.” He’s right…. We thought we had inflation basically contained. The Fed had announced a series of rate hikes…. Covid relief spending… has dried up. As a result, inflation expectations moderated.

I think not. Facing these two new supply shocks from a position of a lower current inflation rate would have a small advantage. But the big difference between the impact of supply shocks hinges on whether they hit the economy when the economy has well-anchored inflation expectations vis-à-vis when the economy that has lost its nominal anchors. Thanks to Brainard and Powell, inflation expectations still look well-anchored to me. And whatever narrow advantage going forward would have been gained by having inflation at 4% rather than at 7% over the past year is vastly outweighed by the costs of having some 3 million people additional without jobs now and without jobs over the past year.</p><p>The joker in the deck is that we do not know how far the Chinese government will go in continuing to pursue “zero Covid”, or how effective totalitarians-vs-viruses are going to be. My hunch is that it is likely to get quite bad: people will falsify output statistics rather than tell Xi Jinping that the cost of containing omicron is very high, and omicron looks uncontainable. A recession in China seems likely. The Fed thus needs to be data dependent, to prepare people for an extra year or so of higher inflation, and to repeat over and over again that it has no tolerance for medium-term inflation above 2%/year on average.</p><p>And hope things break favorably.</p><h2>First: Monetary &amp; Fiscal Policy in a Low-Interest Rate Economy</h2><p>Paul Krugman has some interesting musings on these issues: <strong>Paul Krugman</strong>: <em>Credible Irresponsibility Revisited</em> &lt;<a href="https://stonecenter.gc.cuny.edu/credible-irresponsibility-revisited/">https://stonecenter.gc.cuny.edu/credible-irresponsibility-revisited/</a>&gt;. And <strong>Olivier Blanchard</strong>: <em>Fiscal Policy Under Low Interest Rates</em> &lt;</p><p>https://fiscal-policy-under-low-interest-rates.pubpub.org/</p><p>&gt;…</p><p>Let’s rewind the tape:</p><p>Ever since the late 1820s, When John Stuart Mill was writing <em>Essays on Some Unsettled Questions in Political Economy</em>, it has been at least moderately clear that the task of a central bank in normal times is to adjust the <em>money supply</em> to <em>money demand</em>, so as to make Say’s Law true in the practice even though it is false in theory—to avoid either the general glut that is the flipside of an excess demand for or the inflationary inability to purchase at expected prices that is the flipside of an excess supply of <em>money</em>.</p><p>In the neo-Wicksellian language that was re-introduced to economic-policy debates in the mid-1990s by Alan Greenspan, this requires the central bank to match the market real interest rate r to the “neutral“ real interest rate r*. But what if the market nominal rate is at the zero lower bound, yet the real rate is still above the neutral rate? As Paul Krugman wrote last week:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>An economy that remains depressed even at zero interest rates ‘wants’ expected inflation. With flexible prices it will get there by deflating now so that it can inflate later. But why put [a sticky-price economy] through that wringer? Far better… to give… the inflation without the deflation, by promising that the central bank will do whatever it takes to assure… inflation… high enough to get r down to r*.”</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>That is what a central bank will do if it is following the rule of trying to make Say’s Law true in practice. That is how it can get prices and incentives as close as possible to those in a flex-price well-functioning macroeconomy, given the stickinesses of wages, prices, and debt contracts that we have. And so that inflation is not a disturbance of the optimal macroeconomic market allocation, but rather an instantiation of it.</p><p>Yet, Krugman notes, nobody has listened to him. Instead of talking about how when the central bank hits the zero lower bound it should then generate the inflation that an optimal flex-price economy would deliver, “instead… the discussion is about… deficit spending…. Why? One reason is “the dead hand of conventional wisdom.” But, Paul Krugman says, there are “real arguments for keeping the inflation target low if you can still achieve full employment.” (I would stress that <em>if</em>.)</p><p>What are those real arguments? I see two: (1) a stable unit-of-account yardstick is genuinely useful for contracting purposes, and (2) conserving on cognitive resources is helpful for behavioral reasons.</p><p>But does this mean one should definitely resort to fiscal policy instead? It is not obvious. The way the argument usually goes, using expansionary fiscal policy instead of expected inflation to unwedge an economy with high unemployment stuck at the zero lower bound has huge dangers and drawbacks on its own. It leads to excessive debt accumulation which requires high entrepreneurship-destroying taxes to amortize. It crowds out productive private investment as well. It is thus a two-fold drag on long-run economic growth. Plus there is the risk of cracking the government’s status as a provider of safe assets, with resulting risks of financial crisis and national bankruptcy.</p><p>But, Larry Summers and I argued back in 2012, this argument via appeal to excessive fear of public debt is simply incoherent when the economy is at its zero lower bound, for in a low interest-rate economy the difficulties of financing the national debt—and thus whatever drag on growth is generated by debt accumulation—are not increased but rather decreased by successful expansionary debt-financed fiscal policy. And how about the drag from the crowding-out of private investment? As Paul wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>When interest rates… are below the economy’s growth rate… the economy <em>shouldn’t </em>accumulate [more] capital…. [With] a distinction between the interest rate on… a safe asset, and… higher rates of return on private investment… the appropriate r in the r-g comparison is somewhere between [safe and risky]…. What matters is… the rate of return on those forms of investment that would be stimulated by negative real interest rates…. Cho[osing] to pursue higher public spending at the expense of lower private investment… mainly… substituting government expenditure for residential investment…</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>And, I would add, substituting government expenditure for dissipative grifts—for low interest rates induce organizations that are not well-setup to judge risks to take risks in reaching for yield, and one of the oldest tricks in the financial book is to make money by inducing your counterparty to take on risks that they do not understand.</p><p>As I see it, the question of which r—a risk-free safe asset or a risky one, and, if risky, how risky—should be compared to the economy’s growth rate g is a subtle one, and it hinges on where in the economy the risk premium comes from. In our economies, the financial-asset risk premium does not come from risk aversion induced by a declining marginal utility of wealth: it is simply ludicrous to pretend that it is so or, if it is so, it is because of an astonishing failure to mobilize society’s true risk-bearing capacity that must be due to other, major financial market failures. What are they?</p><p>It has always seemed to me that the presumption is that risk-bearing and investment-judging capacity does not combine with capital in fixed proportions, and that a world with less investment is one in which investment projects use more of risk-bearing and investment-judging resources. Thus my belief is that the right r to use in the g&gt;r comparison has to be very very close to the risk-free rate.</p><p>What about when things change, and when you exit the g&gt;r régime? It has always seemed to me that the costs and risks of such are low—governments, after all, have enormous powers of financial regulation to ultimately boost demand for their debt, if they wish, providing that the government can tax enough to keep the debt position fundamentally sound in the long run.</p><p>But these are “active research issues”.</p><h3>References:</h3><p><strong>Paul Krugman</strong>: <em>Credible Irresponsibility Revisited</em>&lt;<a href="https://stonecenter.gc.cuny.edu/credible-irresponsibility-revisited/">https://stonecenter.gc.cuny.edu/credible-irresponsibility-revisited/</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>Olivier Blanchard</strong>: <em>Fiscal Policy Under Low Interest Rates</em> &lt;</p><p>https://fiscal-policy-under-low-interest-rates.pubpub.org/</p><p>&gt;</p><p><strong>Olivier Blanchard</strong>: <em>Public Debt and Low Interest Rates</em>&lt;<a href="https://www.piie.com/system/files/documents/wp19-4.pdf">https://www.piie.com/system/files/documents/wp19-4.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman</strong>: <em>It’s Baaack: Japan's Slump &amp; the Return of the Liquidity Trap </em>&lt;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1998/06/1998b_bpea_krugman_dominquez_rogoff.pdf">https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1998/06/1998b_bpea_krugman_dominquez_rogoff.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman</strong>: <em>It’s Baaack: 20 Years Later</em>&lt;<a href="https://m.gc.cuny.edu/sites/default/files/2021-07/Its-baaack.pdf">https://m.gc.cuny.edu/sites/default/files/2021-07/Its-baaack.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>Peter Temin &amp; Barry Wigmore</strong>: <em>The Gold Standard &amp; the Great Depression</em>&lt;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20081742">https://www.jstor.org/stable/20081742</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>Barry Eichengreen</strong>: <em>Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard &amp; the Great Depression</em>&lt;<a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195101138.001.0001/acprof-9780195101133">https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195101138.001.0001/acprof-9780195101133</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>David Reifschneider &amp; John C.

No, we are not back to pre-plague levels. But we are certainly getting there. And a full recovery is certainly attainable: we could have another 7 million jobs over the next two years, if we are lucky and skillful:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Ellen Ioanes</strong>: <em>Understand the News</em>: ‘The labor market added 678,000 jobs in February, driving the unemployment rate down to 3.8 percent from 4 percent in January, the lowest level since the start of the pandemic…. The strong employment numbers are a good sign for the labor market and reflect a rebound from the latest wave of Covid–19 infections due to the omicron variant — and post-pandemic recovery overall. But employment is not yet back to pre-pandemic levels, and many people need to negotiate child care and health concerns. The employment boom isn’t hitting everyone equally; the unemployment rate for Black women rose from 5.8 percent to 6.1 percent in February from the previous month. Their participation in the workforce also decreased by .2 percentage points last month. Nevertheless, the positive jobs numbers are part of the calculus that goes into the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates in an effort to combat inflation…. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that “hindsight says we should have moved earlier” on rate increases…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;</p><p>https://www.vox.com/</p><p>&gt;</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>And let me disagree with Powell: I see no reason why the Fed should have “moved earlier” on rate increases. Bond-market expectations of medium- and long-term inflation are still extraordinarily well-anchored. And one of the major benefits of maintaining the anchor is that then it gives you policy flexibility to do whatever is optimal in the short run to attain maximum feasible employment and productivity growth.</p><p>That means that the Federal Reserve’s task is to craft a path for interest rates <em>and for the short-term inflation rate</em> that gets the economy to the place where a well-functioning frictionless flex-price macroeconomy would go if it could. We cannot have a frictionless flex-price macroeconomy. We have sticky prices. We have, for very powerful human psychological reasons, downward-sticky wages. We have sticky debts. (In the context of sticky debts, the standard 20th-century austerian belief that a business-cycle free macroeconomy could be attained in a straightforward way by a war to destroy labor unions appears more than usually silly.) The fact that we are repeatedly kissing up to and sticking to the zero-lower bound means that the nominal interest-rate degree-of=freedom is simply not enough to do the job.</p><p>Plus we do need for relative prices to move to provide the incentives for the structural sectoral adjustment that we need to undertake.</p><p>So why, again, should the Fed have moved earlier to hike interest rates? If medium- and long-term inflation expectations were on the move, I would get the point. But where is the evidence that they are?</p><h2>First: The Federal Reserve Continues to Look Like It Has It…</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3584bb2-c71e-4414-8458-84dbd75564ef_1332x1034.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3584bb2-c71e-4414-8458-84dbd75564ef_1332x1034.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3584bb2-c71e-4414-8458-84dbd75564ef_1332x1034.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3584bb2-c71e-4414-8458-84dbd75564ef_1332x1034.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3584bb2-c71e-4414-8458-84dbd75564ef_1332x1034.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a3584bb2-c71e-4414-8458-84dbd75564ef_1332x1034.png" width="1332" height="1034" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a3584bb2-c71e-4414-8458-84dbd75564ef_1332x1034.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1034,&quot;width&quot;:1332,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:632266,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3584bb2-c71e-4414-8458-84dbd75564ef_1332x1034.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3584bb2-c71e-4414-8458-84dbd75564ef_1332x1034.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3584bb2-c71e-4414-8458-84dbd75564ef_1332x1034.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3584bb2-c71e-4414-8458-84dbd75564ef_1332x1034.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A week ago I was saying that the Federal Reserve has launched itself into its triple jump, and the question is whether it will manage to stick the landing. A week ago I was very confident that the bond market, at least, believed in the Federal Reserve—the inflation expectations were still very well anchored and thus let the Federal Reserve had enormous policy flexibility to react month by month, and adjust the pace at which it tried to cool down aggregate demand so as to keep the recovery going at a strong pace. This looked to me like a big victory.</p><p>Now we face the prospect of a rather large supply shock, because if sanctions against Putin's Muscovy are to be truly effective they will have to bite in the energy sector. Yes, NATO could attempt to restrict itself to “cheap” sanctions—attempting to confiscate the wealth of oligarchs, and providing unlimited personal weapons to Ukrainian guerrillas and urban-warfare semi-guerrillas via Lend-Lease. And that might be enough: as the low-morale Muscovite army begins to bleed out via urban warfare, the power-brokers in Moscow really ought to see that the only rational thing is to call off the whole affair—the only question is whether Putin gets ahead of the parade and declares victory via an annexation of Luhansk and Donetsk (and some or all of Sumy, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson?) followed by withdrawal, or whether Putin’s close contacts turn out to be unusually brave and willing to make this a 1964 “we don’t need this leader and his hare-brained schemes” moment.</p><p>In my view, the right policy for the Federal Reserve would be to continue to prioritize recovery <em><strong>as long as 5 year/5 year inflation expectations continue to remain well-anchored</strong></em>, but to accept the employment-reduction costs needed to keep the anchor if the bond market begins to move. What’s that, you say, you are surrendering monetary policy to a potential bunch of vigilantes? Yes. But push the envelope a bit: require that the vigilantes actually show up, instead of letting fear that they might drive you into policies that your successors will greatly regret as much as Powell and Brainard now regret the missteps of late-Greenspan and Bernanke.</p><p>Why do I think that we should engage in this form of forward bond-market-expectations-of-inflation targeting? One reason is that bond-market expectations are the best read we have of inflation expectations, and that the near-consensus is now that persistent moderate inflation is overwhelmingly an expectational phenomenon. To look at anything else is to look in the wrong direction:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Emi Nakamura</strong>: <em>Is the Phillips Curve Getting Flatter?</em></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>(Yes: these are both my Berkeley colleagues. There is a reason the Berkeley Economics Department punches massively, massively, far above the weight that its financial endowment fundamentals would justify. All those thinking about giving to an economics department—consider that our incremental funding-to-results ratio is easily 5 times that of the overendowed privates.)</p><p>A second reason is that the demand-side component of the shortfall between current employment and the pre-plague employment trend is now small: the rise in employment from 142 million at Biden’s inauguration to 149 million now—7 million in one year—is an extraordinary economic-policy victory that Biden, Yellen, Powell, and Brainard should be very proud of, and that we should not ignore going forward:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Alex Domash &amp; Lawrence Summers</strong>: <em>How Tight Are U.S. Labor Markets?</em>: ‘(i) Unemployment is a better predictor of wage inflation than non-employment and (ii) vacancy rates and quit rates have substantial predictive power for wage inflation…. Vacancy and quit rates currently experienced in the United States correspond to a degree of labor market tightness previously associated with sub–2 percent unemployment rates…. Labor market tightness is likely to contribute significantly to inflationary pressure in the United States for some time to come…</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a

Wages are rising rapidly, suggesting that labor currently has a lot of bargaining power…. Inflation is running uncomfortably high…. It’s time for the Federal Reserve to cool things down…. Can the Fed pull this off without sending us into a recession? It will be tricky….

Given the (apparent) weak jobs reports for November and December, pundits were expecting more of the same in January. Sean Spicer, the truth-challenged press secretary and Dancing with the Stars washout, was practicing the cha‑cha in anticipation of a bleak jobs report. CNN ran a commentary that led with, “The January jobs report is likely to be ugly.” Not only was the January jobs report good, but the Labor Department revised upward the employment statistics for November and December 2021, which had previously suggested a slowing economy…</p><h2>First: The 1970s Are a Very Bad Analogy for Today:</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b922151-51bd-4443-87ec-95e87f7dd862_1344x864.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b922151-51bd-4443-87ec-95e87f7dd862_1344x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b922151-51bd-4443-87ec-95e87f7dd862_1344x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b922151-51bd-4443-87ec-95e87f7dd862_1344x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b922151-51bd-4443-87ec-95e87f7dd862_1344x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8b922151-51bd-4443-87ec-95e87f7dd862_1344x864.png" width="1344" height="864" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8b922151-51bd-4443-87ec-95e87f7dd862_1344x864.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:864,&quot;width&quot;:1344,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:117046,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b922151-51bd-4443-87ec-95e87f7dd862_1344x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b922151-51bd-4443-87ec-95e87f7dd862_1344x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b922151-51bd-4443-87ec-95e87f7dd862_1344x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b922151-51bd-4443-87ec-95e87f7dd862_1344x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Philipp Hildebrand is talking his book. And it is a very good book to talk.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Philipp Hildebrand</strong>: <em>The Old Inflation Playbook No Longer Applies</em>: ‘The debate about how “transitory” inflation would end up being missed the point. The root cause of this rise is more important…. Post-pandemic inflation surge is not principally being driven by excessive demand but by limits on supply capacity…. First, there are economy-wide constraints. In the restart of activity after lockdowns it proved harder to bring supply capacity on stream than for demand to restart. Even more important has been a second sort of misfiring: supply capacity was in the wrong place…. We therefore find ourselves in a fundamentally different situation from the one Paul Volcker faced when he became chair of the US Federal Reserve in 1979. Then, the economy was running hot and the aim was to drive inflation that had become embedded out of the system. But this is not a Volcker moment…. When inflation is driven by demand, judicious policy can in principle stabilise both inflation and growth. This is not possible in a world where inflation is the result of supply constraints. Heightened macro volatility becomes inevitable. Central banks have either to accept higher inflation or be prepared literally to destroy demand across the whole economy to ease supply constraints in one part of it…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1e59e952-c5cf-4c8e-983a-560170c87cda">https://www.ft.com/content/1e59e952-c5cf-4c8e-983a-560170c87cda</a>&gt;</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Back in the 1970s we knew what the structural-adjustment problem was. The two triplings of oil prices, in 1973 and 1979, meant that everything energy intensive had the relative price structure strongly tilted against it. There was not a great deal of price discovery to be done: simply take the energy intensity of an activity and multiply it by nine, and you get with the new equilibrium real price of it was going to be.</p><p>The problem in that 1970s was that an expectation that wage inflation next year would be about what wage inflation had been this year, perhaps a percentage point per year or so more, also got embedded in the economy. But that embedding came with no countervailing information flow in terms of price discovery about the true real costs of energy intensive activities. We already knew what OPEC had done, and what its consequences were going to be.</p><p>Our problem today is considerably different. We are wheeling the structure of our economy in a number of different directions with remarkable speed. And there is no sufficient statistic for what the new real equilibrium prices are going to be in the same way that black gold delivered in Cushing, Oklahoma was a sufficient statistic back in The Day. Thus we need to see where the bottlenecks are, and those bottlenecks need to move prices in order to incentivize people to correct them. What we do not want to do is squeeze down on economic production in general so that the bottlenecks go away. That would produce low inflation, true. That would also produce low production. And that would keep us from undertaking the von Hayekian price discovery that the economy needs to learn as fast as possible.</p><p>And, with good luck, and with a Federal Reserve able to manage expectations of its own future actions, we can do this with just a one time step-up of the price level, and not get expectations of continual year-after-year wage inflation in bedded in the expectational and contracting structures of the economy.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><h2>First: Why Isn’t There an Inflation Non-Panic?</h2><p>I read:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Mohamed El-Erian</strong>: <em>The Key to 2022 Will Be How Inflation Is Brought Down</em>: ‘For more than a decade, large-scale central bank purchases of assets boosted not just those being bought in markets but also virtually all other assets, be they financial or physical (such as housing, art and other collectibles). This was particularly the case in 2021…. As the new year unfolds, both the Fed and markets have a huge stake in inflation coming down in an orderly way. But the window of opportunity for policy to achieve this is rapidly closing. The alternative is a disorderly drop, which would involve the even bigger Fed policy error of having to be too abrupt in tightening monetary policy after being way too slow previously…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/20e0857b-99cb-4495-8677-8746d97db836#myft:my-news:page">https://www.ft.com/content/20e0857b-99cb-4495-8677-8746d97db836#myft:my-news:page</a>&gt;</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>And:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Robert Armstrong</strong>: <em>How to Panic About Inflation</em>: ‘High levels of panic will be appropriate if we see sharp acceleration in services prices, especially outside healthcare and transport…. This would indicate that the strong wage gains we have seen recently are spreading pervasively though the economy, in ways that could (in theory) scare everyone into thinking inflation is here to say, and trigger the dreaded wage-price spiral…. If the Fed gets to its target two per cent rate in 2023—that still means negative short-term rates…. “That is not going to constrain the cost of financing anything”…. The Fed might have to get much more hawkish than it is now, with heavy consequences for markets. Unhedged is not there yet, because we’re just not convinced demand will be strong for long, and the bond market supports our doubts. But Michele’s argument frightens us all the same…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04892b1b-d977-473d-8b54-d34e33a29703">https://www.ft.com/content/04892b1b-d977-473d-8b54-d34e33a29703</a>&gt;</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>And my immediate first response is to ask the question: In what sense is the Fed supposed to have been "way too slow" in tightening monetary policy? We still are way short of full employment. Some of that is due to childcare and virus-fear bottlenecks. But some of it isn’t. And to the extent that there are important jobs not being done because people can’t afford to make alternative childcare arrangements or fear the virus—well, the inflation that comes from paying people more to see if they will take those jobs is to be welcomed, not fought:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f6e4761-0ee6-42e7-bf25-d291b1b0dca0_1346x908.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f6e4761-0ee6-42e7-bf25-d291b1b0dca0_1346x908.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f6e4761-0ee6-42e7-bf25-d291b1b0dca0_1346x908.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f6e4761-0ee6-42e7-bf25-d291b1b0dca0_1346x908.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f6e4761-0ee6-42e7-bf25-d291b1b0dca0_1346x908.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1f6e4761-0ee6-42e7-bf25-d291b1b0dca0_1346x908.png" width="1346" height="908" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1f6e4761-0ee6-42e7-bf25-d291b1b0dca0_1346x908.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:908,&quot;width&quot;:1346,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:83537,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f6e4761-0ee6-42e7-bf25-d291b1b0dca0_1346x908.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f6e4761-0ee6-42e7-bf25-d291b1b0dca0_1346x908.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f6e4761-0ee6-42e7-bf25-d291b1b0dca0_1346x908.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f6e4761-0ee6-42e7-bf25-d291b1b0dca0_1346x908.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Plus the economy has undergone a great wheel: 6% less relative to trend in personal consumption expenditures on services, and 20% more relative to trend in personal consumption expenditures on goods.
