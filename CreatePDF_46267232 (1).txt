CONDITION: Remembering Martin Luther King, Jr.:

Martin Luther King, Jr. (December 18,1963): Address at Western Michigan State University'. a€~Now 
the other myth that gets around is the idea that legislation cannot really solve the problem and 
that it has no great role to play in this period of social change because youa€™ ve got to change 
the heart and you cana€™ t change the heart through legislation. You cana€™ t legislate morals. The 
job must be
done through education and religion.

Well, therea€™ s half-truth involved here.

Certainly, if the problem is to be solved then in the final sense, hearts must be changed. Religion 
and education must play a great role in changing the heart.
But we must go on to say that while it may be true that morality cannot be legislated, behavior can 
be regulated.

It may be true that the law cannot change the heart but it can restrain the heartless.

It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me and I 
think that is pretty important, also.

So there is a need for executive orders. There is a need for judicial decrees. There is a need for 
civil rights legislation on the local scale within states and on the national scale from the 
federal governmental

Slow Boring

The bad vibes of American political institutions

Thomas Friedmana€™ s column floating the idea of Biden-Cheney 2024 has a dumb headline, but it 
focuses on a reasonable and important analogy for the current American political situation a€” the 
governing coalition in Israel. As Friedman notes, the current Israeli cabinet is a€oethe most 
diverse national unity government in Israela€™ s history, one that stretches from Jewish settlers
on the right all the way to an Israeli-Arab Islamist party and super-liberals on the left.a€D What 
unites the coalition members? The belief that Benjamin Netanyahu is corrupt and was using his 
powers of office to undermine the rule of law and facilitate his personal corruption. Friedman 
suggests that a similar big-tent anti-Trump coalition, headlined by a Biden-Cheney ticket in 2024,
could be a more politically effective machine than the current version of Bidenism, which is 
obsessed with trying to arm-twist Joe Manchin into passing more legislation but not actually 
enacting that much legislation^!

It wasna€™ t Trotskya€™ s arrogance that sank him: it was that he was Lenina€™ s #2. Thus until 
Lenina€™ s death Lenin was punching down to make sure Trotsky did not unseat him, while everyone 
else was punching up, thinking that while they agreed on nothing else they agreed that none of them 
had a chance of becoming #1 unless Trotsky was removed. And they were all ambitious:

Branko Milano vic: Trotsky on the Class Structure of Soviet Socialism: a€~I wrote recently about 
the very negative view that Kolakowski had of Trotsky. I find that view largely justified (on the 
topics Kolakowski criticized Trotsky), but there is no denying qualities of Trotsky as 
intellectual, writer, organizer and military leader. It was his arrogance and hubris that did him 
in, but
thata€™ s a different topic. So, how does Trotsky approach the Stalinist state in a€ceThe 
Revolution Betrayeda€D?a€! The Soviet state is a proletarian state because private ownership of 
means of production has been abolisheda€!. Bureaucracy has built itself into a new stratum that has 
vitiated the original (a€cedemocratica€D) objectives of the revolution in its superstructure
(politics), but has not fundamentally managed to alter the infrastructure^!. [As] Caesarisma€! 
changed politics in Rome but did not affect the underlying slave-owning relations of production^! 
[as] the Thermidorian reaction in Francea€! did not erase economic gains (e.g. distribution of land 
to small-holders)a€!. In some parts of the book he celebrates the achievements of the
a€oeStalinist Thermidora€na€! enormous increases in industrial outputa€! the new system as 
self-evidently more productive than the olda€!. He calls only for the revolution in politicsa€! 
overthrow the new ruling stratum (Trotsky avoid the term a€oeclassa€n because he believes that the 
term should be reserved for societies with private ownership of capital), and to reestablish the
original pristine character of the revolution^!. Trotskya€! following Marx, believes that in a 
non-class-based society work will become the expression of our desire to do things well, that the 
homo faber has the need for self-realization in his work, and that that need can be expressed 
freely only when he is not a hired labored ordered around by capitalistsa€!

Carter Sherman: Some Washington Post Editors Maybe Should Stop Tweeting About Sexual Assault: a€™ 
Months after Felicia Sonmez sued the Washington Post for banning her from covering sexual 
misconduct stories after she came forward as a sexual assault survivor, a tweet by one of the 
editorsa€!. Lori Montgomery attacked a column about the NFL player Ben Roethlisberger. a€oeThe only 
interesting
thing about this column is how easily disproven and completely FOS it is,a€D Montgomery tweeted 
about the columna€’’which mentioned the fact that Roethlisberger has been accused of sexual assault 
on multiple occasions. That original tweet has been deleted, and Montgomery has tweeted out an 
acknowledgement that a€oeRoethlisberger was credibly accused twice of sexual assault.a€D (Shea€™ s 
since
gone private on Twitter.) But Montgomerya€™ s tweet, and how Post leadership will ultimately handle 
its fallout, arrives amid a public reckoning over how the Post and other newsrooms treat sexual 
assault and the people who survive ita€!. Montgomery told Sonmez that a€oeshe was always taught 
that a woman should a€~just say noa€™ if a man tries to assault her.a€D The Post has moved to 
dismiss
Sonmeza€™ s lawsuit and in the months since its filing, many of the named defendants have ascended 
the Posta€™ s professional ladder. In July, Montgomery became the Posta€™ s business editor. An 
October promotion for Cameron Barra€”who, according to Sonmeza€™ s lawsuit, accused Sonmez of 
having a€oetaken a side on the issuea€D of sexual assaulta€’’essentially made him a€oesecond-in-
command    in the newsrooma€™ s hierarchy,a€D in the newspapera€™ s own words. And just last week,

Possible Grand Narratives:

I settled on the a€oevon Hayek vs. Polanyi refereed by Keynesa€D Grand Narrative for Slouching 
Towards Utopia because it was the least false Grand Narrative I could think of, and I needed a 
Grand Narrative. Why did I need a Grand Narrative? Because we can rarely thinka€”and never 
remembera€’’without one. And once I had decided that 1870 to 2010 was the period, the Polanyi-von 
Hayek-Keynes one
was the one that imposed itself as by far the least false to as much of the history as possible.

But there are other Grand Narratives I could have chosen to write about. In a self-indulgent 
passage I did manage to sneak by development editor Thomas LeBien and Basic Books editor Brian 
Distelberg and into the book:

Two currents of thought emerged after World War I that sought not just alteration but fundamental 
transformation of the pseudo-classical semi-liberal order. They were to gain flesh and rule, 
bloodily and destructively. They were Vladimir Lenina€™ s version of really-existing socialism, and 
Benito Mussolinia€™ s fascism, both of which you will see later at great length.
But there were others thinking hard and trying to work to find and implement a better system. If I 
may digress for a moment: If my editor would allow this book to be twice as long, I would trace 
many of these currents of thought and the actions that flowed from them.

I would trace the current for which Joseph Schumpeter, born in 1882 one hundred miles away from 
Vienna in the primarily Czech-speaking part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, is a convenient marker: 
society needing to be altered to elevate the role of the entrepreneur and provide space for the 
a€oecreative destructiona€D of economic and other patterns of organization he set in
motion to counterbalance growing bureaucratization brought about by the increasing scale of capital 
intensity needed to deploy technological advances.

I would trace the current for which Karl Popper, born in Vienna in 1902, is a convenient marker: 
society needing to double down on liberalism and freedom in all their forms to create a truly 
a€oeopen society.a€D I would trace the current for which Peter Drucker, born in Vienna in 1909, is 
a convenient marker: how freedom, entrepreneurship, cooperation, and organization could never
be reconciled by either the laissez-faire market or the really-existing socialist plan, but instead 
required persuasion, in the form of managers and management, to reconcile points of view and 
actually get humans to, you know, work cooperatively semi-efficiently.

Moreover, I would trace the current for which Michael Polanyi, born in 1891 in Budapest, is a 
convenient marker: society needing not just the decentralized mercenary institution of the market, 
and definitely not needing comprehensive central planning, which can never be more than a fiction, 
but needing decentralized fiduciary institutions focused on advancing knowledge about theory
and practice, in which status is gained by teaching othersa€”such as in modern science, communities 
of engineering practice, communities of legal interpretation, honorable journalism, evidence-based 
politics, and othersa€”and in which people follow rules that have been half-constructed and that 
half-emerged to advance not just the private interests and liberties of the participants but
the broader public interest and public liberties as well.

But as there is neither time nor space for all of that, In this book I can only trace two currents 
of thought and action: first, the current we have seen before, for which Friedrich von Hayek (born 
in Vienna in 1899) is a convenient marker (that all that needed to be altered was that 
market-economic institutions had to be purified and perfected, and supported by an anti-permissive 
social and
cultural order) and the current we have seen before for which Michael Polanyia€™ s older brother 
Karl, born in Vienna in 1886, is the convenient marker (that the market recognized only property 
rights, and a society made up of humans who insisted that they had more rights for that would 
reacta€”left or right, sensibly or stupidly, but powerfullya€”to that failure of recognition). And I
will trace how they could be shotgun-married to each other, with the blesser of the wedding being 
John Maynard Keynes. That, I believe, is the principal grand narrative.

Or at least it is minea€!

Those other books would also have been wonderful to write.

The Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin-Brezhnev-Kosygin, with Kosygin being the road not taken when the 
military-industrial complex outweighed him in the late 1960s would have been a blast. Might Kosygin 
have been the Deng Xiaoping of the USSR? Quite possibly. But the person who should write that book 
would be a person who reads Russian very, very well, and has long thought hard about the Soviet
experience,

Then there is the Mussolini-Hitler-(Bolsonaro, Modhi, Trump) book: it also would have been great 
fun to write. And somebody should really do ita€’’although almost surely not me.

I would still love to write the Schumpeter book: a Grand Narrative of creative destruction, 
technology, and entrepreneurship vs. bureaucracy as the terrain on which 20th-century history 
played itself out would be a great addition to the worlda€™ s knowledge base. I could write that 
book. Indeed, I did write large pieces of it, now on the cutting-room floor. Perhaps I have an 
Entrepreneurship, Enterprises, &
Organizations, 1500-2020 book project in my future?

Then there are the two books that I am least qualified to write: the Management as the Key to the 
Riddle of History Peter F. Drucker book, and the Dialogue & Division of Labor Between Mercenary & 
Fiduciary Institutions Michael Polanyi book. I would love to read either. I cannot think of who 
could write either, however.
