Most of the value accrued to the edges of the network: users and builders. The second era of the internet—roughly 2005–2020—was about siloed, centralized services. Most of the value accrued to a handful of large tech companies. We are now beginning the third era of the internet—what many call web3—which combines the decentralized, community-governed ethos of the first era with the advanced, modern functionality of the second era. This will unlock a new wave of creativity and entrepreneurship…. Layer 1 Blockchains…. Layer 2 Scaling: A layer 2 is a separate blockchain that extends the base layer and inherits its security guarantees…. DeFi: A huge part of the world is underserved by existing financial institutions…. Stablecoins: There are three primary categories of stablecoins, though the lines between them are blurry: Fiat Backed, Crypto Backed, Algorithmic…. NFTs: We’ve seen several categories of NFTs emerge, but it’s still very early days…. Web3 Gaming…. DAOs….

One thing web3 and Amway both (allegedly) have in common is talking about eliminating all these middlemen, all the while introducing new ones. Another is turning your friends into wild-eyed fanatics who can’t stop trying to sell you on a convoluted and complicated system that they’re totally gonzo for, but still can’t articulate exactly how it is supposed to work. The best example of this would be Marc Andreesen’s conversation with Tyler Cowen.

You are comfortable enough, with several sources of income, and do not care much about monetizing your podcast in a serious way. But in that you are anomalous. Most of the people who in a good future would be making podcasts and so adding value, knowledge, and entertainment to the world will not do so unless they can monetize it in some way. At the moment we are split into two internets. The first is a "Web1" Internet, in which the expectation is for free and so people are strongly resistant to making micro payments and so nobody makes any money. The second is a “Web2” internet, in which big companies have figured out how to do some monetization, and have capitalized on this to create walled gardens—thus greatly disrupting the scope and reach of the network—in which they grab the lion’s share of the money for themselves, thus restricting the number of those who can afford to create: the Facebooks, Googles, Apples, and so forth.</p><p>Podcasting is, if things continue as they have, headed for a future in which some get sucked into the walled gardens, in which those podcasters who hit the celebrity-reinforcement loop get rich, in which “Web2” companies profit enormously, and in which a very large chunk of those who in a good world would be members of the long tail making a reasonable living have to drop out, and only those truly driven to communicate or with alternate comfortable means have the freedom to be able to afford to podcast.</p><p>We “Web3” people want a different future for podcasting. And at the heart of that will be a web of identity and network connections and trusted payments that is not the property of any single walled-garden entity that is a wannabee monopolist, but is the common creation of the community as a whole.</p><p>That is what I would say if I were Marc Andreessen in the video below.</p><p>What does this vision of “Web3” that I think Marc Andreessen should have laid out in his conversation with Tyler Cowen tell us about the proper value of BitCoin today?</p><p>It says: the proper value of BitCoin today is zero. Ownership of BitCoin today gives you no property rights over the useful BlockChain databases that will underpin the community-owned web of identity and network connections and trusted payments that is the heart of the good Web3 future. Indeed, to imagine that you will be able to grab huge amounts of money from the l BlockChain databases that will underpin the community-owned web of identity and network connections and trusted payments in the good Web3 future is to make a category mistake: it is Web2 thinking. Nothing will give you property rights over the useful BlockChain databases that will underpin the community-owned web of identity and network connections and trusted payments that is the heart of the good Web3 future. If something would, than it would not be the good Web3 future.</p><p>Yes, this poses “challenges” for Andreessen-Horwitz’s crypto-Web3 business model. Perhaps that is why he did not say it…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/is-there-a-web3-and-?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/is-there-a-web3-and-?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><div id="youtube2-e29M9uW5p2A" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;e29M9uW5p2A&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e29M9uW5p2A?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay;

The next… was <em>Looking Backward</em> by Edward Bellamy… published in 1888… sold one million copies…. More than 500 Bellamy Clubs were formed…. The book is an extended conversation in which each man explains his society to the other. “How do you manage <em><strong>that</strong></em>?” [time-traveling protagonist] Julian asks incredulously about the new society’s absence of poverty and inequality, its extremely short work week, its freedom of manners, and so on. Dr. Leete explains; Julian observes that such rational and humane arrangements would have seemed to his contemporaries utterly impossible and contrary to human nature; and then it is Dr. Leete’s turn to ask incredulously “But why did you believe <em><strong>that</strong></em>?” This seems like the right way to go about imagining a conversation between the present and the future…. What features of our present moral consensus might we need to alter in order to make a rational and humane future?… All production is social production. The productive assets of every age are the joint product of all preceding ages, and all those born into the present are legitimately joint heirs of those assets. And the same arguments for joint rather than individual inheritance of wealth created in the past apply to the distribution of income in the present. As Doctor Leete tells Julian: “From the moment that men begin to live together and constitute even the rudest sort of society, self-support becomes impossible. As men grow more civilized and the subdivision of occupations and services is carried out, a complex mutual dependence becomes the universal rule. Every man, however solitary may seem his occupation, is a member of a vast industrial partnership, as large as the nation, as large as humanity. How could you not see that this necessity of mutual dependence implies the duty and guarantee of mutual support?”… I imagine the 23rd century will ask… “How could you have overlooked… the obvious and elementary principle of fairness: from each according to her abilities, to each according to her need?”…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="http://georgescialabba.net/mtgs/2018/03/slouching-toward-utopia.html">http://georgescialabba.net/mtgs/2018/03/slouching-toward-utopia.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>I am not sure that this is right.

Next is the durability of these adverse outcomes… much of the hit was up front, but persistent increased risk was evident for most endpoints throughout the 6 months follow-up….

Without an equitable distribution of social power, society cannot be "resilient" because society is, instead, geared to extract labor and value from the poor and give it to the rich, so the rich can live leisured and comfortable lives. You have to give those who would otherwise be poor direct access to and control over resources. And in a market economy, that means pre-distribution—eliminating choke points that make some particular resources have great scarcity value—and redistribution as well. But to say that it is "government" and "market" that must "solve" the problem of "resilience" is, I think, to miss the big point:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Rajiv Sethi</strong>: <em>The Resilient Society</em>: ‘By Markus Brunnermeier…. In a resilient society… we can “take more chances and embrace more opportunities—because the shocks will be less detrimental.”… But how might households and firms be induced to take actions that they would otherwise prefer not to take, in order that the system as a whole becomes more resilient?
