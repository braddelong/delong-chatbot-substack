Calling people into the office if they aren’t showing up for office hours—that seems a little heavy-handed to me. Phone calls with people you do not already know—that is not terribly effective. But zoom! It is much better than a phone call, and does not (or does not any longer) seem too heavy-handed.</p><p>The other innovation I want to adopt is for courses in which each week is a book. Having the group “discuss” the book for an hour, and then call up the author on zoom—that seems to me to be a very good innovation. It is Barry Eichengreen’s. It is a wonderful thing. It should become the rule rather than the exception in the future.</p><p>But for classes in general? I think we learned from the two plague years that we cannot do online education well enough—at least not yet.</p><p>Look: Online classes work for me. But reading books works for me. For example, my wife says I spend more time talking to, say, Barry Eichengreen in the shower than I do in person. And his office is just down the hall.</p><p>And, you know, indeed: &lt;madeline_kahn_voice&gt;<em><strong>it’s twue, it’s twue</strong></em>&lt;/madeline_kahn_voice&gt;.</p><p>I read one of Barry’s books. I look at black squiggles on a white page. And from them, I then spin-up something. What is it? As best as I can describe it, it is a sub-Turing instantiation of Barry’s mind. I then run that sub-Turing instantiation on a partition in my wetware. And I argue with it—him—whatever. </p><p>I am not strange. (OK. I am not <em><strong>that</strong></em> strange.) Consider the words of Machiavelli’s “Letter to Vettori”, in which he describes his evenings in his <em><strong>library</strong></em>:</p><blockquote><p>I return to my house and enter my study; and at the door I take off the day’s clothing, covered with mud and dust, and put on garments regal and courtly; and reclothed appropriately, I enter the ancient courts of ancient men, where, received by them with affection, I feed on that food which only is mine and which I was born for, where I am not ashamed to speak with them and to ask them the reason for their actions; and they in their kindness answer me; and for four hours of time I do not feel boredom, I forget every trouble, I do not dread poverty, I am not frightened by death; entirely I give myself over to them…</p></blockquote><p>But that’s not how most of our students experience reading, or experience attending an online class. For them, the experience is captured not by Machiavelli, but by Sokrates here:</p><blockquote><p>Writing is unfortunately like painting…. You would imagine that they had intelligence, but if you want to know anything and put a question to one of them… they are tumbled about… and know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused, they… cannot protect or defend themselves…. [Writing] give[s] not truth, but only the semblance of truth… hear[ing] of many things and… learn[ing] nothing… tiresome company… the show of wisdom without the reality…</p></blockquote><p>From the Machiavellian point of view, why go to university? From the Sokratic point of view, the purpose of the entire educational establishment can only be to create opportunities for the Dialectic to manifest itself—and question and answered dialogue between teacher and student, between student and student, and between student and figment of the student’s imagination. Good educational systems maximize those opportunities. Bad educational systems do not.</p><p>As Chad Orzel puts it:</p><blockquote><p>It’s absolutely possible for a smart and highly motivated individual to learn the skills they need on their own time, without the formal structure of academia. Many people have done it over the years, and most of them are happy to tell you about it at tedious length. The fundamental problem here is that the number of people who think they’re the right sort of highly motivated autodidact to bypass academia is at least one and probably more like two orders of magnitude larger than the number of people who really are…. The whole elaborate edifice of lectures and homework sets and exams and grades is there to provide the extrinsic motivation necessary to get a typical student to put in the work…. The motivation to work out all the end-of-chapter problems in the textbook without peeking at the solutions online…</p></blockquote><p>For a physicist, the Dialectic manifests itself in the doing of problems (and in discussion the doing-of-problems with others: I was struck back in 1981 by the fact that the best score on the General Relativity exam was 3/6 (I got 1/6), but that in the aftermath of the exam it turned out that the class as an anthology intelligence could solve all 6 of the problems). In other disciplines, it manifests itself in other ways. They are not the same Dialectic. But they are close cousins. And the point is to trigger their manifestation.</p><div id="youtube2-eYmmFf6M40Y" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;eYmmFf6M40Y&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eYmmFf6M40Y?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div><hr></div><p><strong>Niccolo Machiavelli</strong>: <em>Letter to Francesco Vettori</em> &lt;<a href="https://courses.washington.edu/hsteu401/Letter%20%20to%20Vettori.pdf">https://courses.washington.edu/hsteu401/Letter%20%20to%20Vettori.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p><strong>Chad Orzel</strong>: <em>Imminent Death of the Academy Predicted</em> </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:50809346,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://chadorzel.substack.com/p/imminent-death-of-the-academy-predicted&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:401191,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Counting Atoms&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bdbc3a84-6569-438b-874b-05ea826cb157_758x758.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Imminent Death of the Academy Predicted&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Back when I was a sophomore at Williams, the sticker price broke twenty thousand dollars for the first time, and some angry person spray-painted the columns of Chapin Hall with the digits: $20,760.

But the thing you have to understand in order to make sense of all the people mad at the <em>New York Times</em> today is that it has a strong culture of non-recognition. In the view not just of academics, but of their competitors: <em><strong>They take all the work, the ideas, and the insights of others, and pass them off as their own</strong></em>. Their competitors are—in private—even more furious than academics out there today couching their lances to defend the honor of Eric Williams;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Paul Cohen</strong>: <em>’It’s kind of stunning</em> to realize that Eric Williams’ classic <em>Capitalism and Slavery</em> isn’t mentioned anywhere in the piece. That this book—whose arguments about the centrality of Caribbean slavery in the origins of modern capitalism proved deeply influential—was published in… 1944 reminds us that the broader questions the NYT is asking aren’t quite as novel as the paper would like to suggest. What the NYT has done is precisely that – no more and no less than what all historians do. And no more than what dozens upon dozens of PhD students and historians working on Saint-Domingue, Haiti, the Haitian Revolution, and the histories of capitalism, colonialism and empire have been doing for decades. I can’t help but feel that their work in the archives, their analysis, their arguments, and their voices have largely been silenced here to a certain extent, the article’s section on “Secondary Sources” is framed in a way that functions to <em>legitimate</em> the journalists’ claims about the originality and importance of their work. Consider one example: the piece invokes economist Thomas Piketty, as having verified the total amount of the reparations Haiti paid to France. He’s cited elsewhere briefly, but you wouldn’t know it from this piece that Piketty devotes a whole chapter of his <em>Capital et Idéologie</em> to reparations not just in France, but in Britain and US (where the national governments compensated slave-owners with taxpayer funds).

Economists call that “expectations”. There are also what people expect inflation to be. That the distribution of people’s individual expectations shifts does not tell me much about what is happening to the state variable. So I am dismissive of this line of work by the very sharp Ricardo Reis:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ricardo Reis</strong>: <em>The People versus the Markets: A Parsimonious Model of Inflation Expectations</em>: ’Expected long-run inflation is sometimes inferred using market prices, other times using surveys. The discrepancy between the two measures has large business-cycle fluctuations, is systematically correlated with monetary policies, and is mostly driven by disagreement, both between households and traders, and between different traders. A parsimonious model that captures both the dispersed expectations in surveys, and the trading of inflation risk in financial markets, can fit the data, and it provides estimates of the underlying expected inflation anchor. Applied to US data, the estimates suggest that inflation became gradually, but steadily, unanchored from 2014 onwards. The model detects this from the fall in cross-person expectations skewness, first across traders, then across people. In general equilibrium, when inflation and the discrepancy are jointly determined, monetary policy faces a trade-off in how strongly to respond to the discrepancy…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/15624.html">https://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/15624.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>A very, very nicely put thumbnail summary of what I have been trying to say about the implications of the coming of modern economic growth after 1870. It destabilized politics and political economy around the globe. Shaky regimes crashed. Solid regimes became shaky. And rock-solid regimes began to feel earthquakes building:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Dominic Lieven</strong>: <em>The End of Tsarist Russia: The March to World War I &amp; Revolution</em>: ‘Although the Russian case is unique, in this respect too international comparisons are nevertheless very important. In the two generations before 1914, European society as a whole had been transformed more fundamentally than in centuries of earlier history. It was hard for anyone to keep his balance amid dramatic economic, social, and cultural change; predictions as to where change might lead in the future could inspire even greater giddiness. A common feature across Europe was the growth of civil society and its impact through the press, lobbies, and political parties on governments. In contemporary parlance, civil society is always supposed to be on the side of the angels. As regards international relations in pre–1914 Europe, this was not true. Civil society, meaning above all the press, often played a big role in stoking international conflict. This might be just a question of pandering to public prejudices and thirst for sensations, but it rattled and bedeviled policy makers nonetheless. More serious were systematic efforts to use foreign policy as a means to generate nationalist support for governments at home, in the process undermining the rational calculations on which diplomatic bargaining was based. No great power, Russia included, was entirely innocent in this respect…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/endoftsaristruss0000liev">https://archive.org/details/endoftsaristruss0000liev</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>I very much agree with Duncan here. Are we fooling ourselves? At the moment, we see only a few of the many strong factors that made for inflation in the 1970s:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Duncan Weldon</strong>: <em>That ’70s Show</em>: ‘2022 is going to be a painful year. But learning the wrong lessons would make it even more so…. Whilst it’s easy to point to the energy price and/or the wage-price as the major drivers, neither alone was sufficient. Instead one should take into account: The energy price spike after the Yom Kippur War. The wage-price spiral in the context of a radically different labour market and wage bargaining structure than exists today. But also… The end of Bretton Woods and the floating of a weak pound. The newly liberalised/deregulated banking system and booming mortgage market. The macroeconomic framework under which policymakers were analysing the economy and how it produced the wrong signals. Some of the worst macro-policy making of the century, with the ill-timed dash for growth stoking the Barber Boom just as the energy crisis hit. Pretty much everything that could go wrong on the inflation front, did. At the same time. Yesterday, to remind myself of the US context, I found myself re-reading Brad Delong’s superb 1997 paper on the US experience. I was especially struck by his argument that a period of high inflation was, perhaps, inevitable…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:55604078,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://duncanweldon.substack.com/p/that-70s-show&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:433651,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Value Added&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2cf814b3-4d6b-4516-bcbc-8e6180790fe4_1280x1280.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;That '70s Show &quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;The number of references to the 1970s appearing in economic opinion columns is stacking up.
