It is not a good game. Republican Michael Strain writes:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Michael Strain: </strong><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/debt-ceiling-house-republicans-averting-disaster-by-michael-r-strain-2023-01">Averting a Debt-Ceiling Disaster:</a> ‘House firebrands… aren’t bluffing. Biden and congressional Democrats need to accept this reality… acknowledge the more widely shared Republican argument that federal spending has reached problematic levels…. find some spending that can be cut…. Responsible members of Congress… [might write] a <a href="https://archives-democrats-rules.house.gov/archives/discharge_pet.htm">discharge petition</a>…. McCarthy could bring a debt-ceiling increase… over the objections of the rabble-rousers, knowing that it would likely cost him his speakership…. Put the country’s welfare first. All responsible politicians must get to work immediately…</p></blockquote><p>The meta-game here is:</p><ol><li><p>Republicans demand that Democrats be “responsible” with respect to the debt-ceiling.</p></li><li><p>Democrats offer policy concessions.</p></li><li><p>In exchange, the Republicans allow a debt-ceiling increase to pass with only a few Republican votes attached to it.</p></li><li><p>Republicans point to the debt-ceiling increase as evidence Democrats are always borrow-and-spend</p></li><li><p>The press repeats the Republican talking point.</p></li><li><p>Republicans solidify their base, attract a few low-information undecideds, and win a few more elections</p></li></ol><p>This does not seem to me to be a very good game for the country.</p><p>Michael Strain wants this game to continue. In order to avoid a debt-ceiling crisis triggering partial government default, Michael Strain asks:</p><ol><li><p>Democrats to put the country first and offer policy concessions,</p></li><li><p>Kevin McCarthy to put the country first and risk losing his Speakership, and </p></li><li><p>non-Handmaid Caucus Republican members of the House to… what? “Be responsible”. What does “responsibility” entail? Michael does not say.</p></li></ol><p>Here’s my take on what “responsibility” entails here:</p><ul><li><p>Democrats in the Senate lead on passing a clean debt-ceiling bill.</p></li><li><p>Biden announces he will sign a clean debt-ceiling bill, but veto anything with riders attached and, instead, either sell high-yield bonds, mint the coin, or let some Social Security checks bounce, depending on what looks like the least-bad option when the crisis comes.</p></li><li><p>150 Republican House members write and sign a discharge petition for a clean debt-ceiling bill.</p></li><li><p>A major, major financial effort by Republican donors to find and fund attractive candidates so that all Handmaid Caucus members lose their next primaries.</p></li></ul><p>Michael envisions, instead, a discharge petitition signed by 212 Democrats and 10 Republicans, or a replacement of McCarthy as Speaker by Scalise.</p><p>Please forgive me for not being impressed.</p><p class="button-wrapper"

Any human who uses language to think with has already incorporated an external device into his most intimate self, and the connections only proliferate from there. In Clark’s opinion, this is an excellent thing. The more devices and objects there are available to foster better ways of thinking, the happier he is. He loves, for instance, the uncanny cleverness of online-shopping algorithms that propose future purchases. He was the last fan of Google Glass…. One day, he lost his laptop, and felt so disoriented and enfeebled that it was as if he’d had a stroke. But this didn’t make him regret his reliance on devices, any more than he regretted having a frontal lobe because it could possibly be damaged. The idea of an extended mind has itself extended far beyond philosophy, which is why Clark is now, in his early sixties, one of the most-cited philosophers alive…</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>I wish I had some hope for a secular, center joint Palestinian Israeli political movement.

But I do not share his dark determinism. I think we have a way out of the current political crisis, but only if we stop thinking in terms of religious and ethnic “demographics.” Instead, we must attempt to build a coalition based on liberal democratic values or, more fundamentally, shared moral concerns. Such a coalition must include Arabs who desire communal self-determination and Jews who want the same, including secular, traditionalists, Modern Orthodox, and yes, individuals and communities among the ultra-Orthodox. Such a coalition should put forth a vision of Israel that is neither an illiberal regime run by rabbis and warmongers nor a state whose legitimacy rests on tribal secular Zionist demographic calculations. If Halkin wants a secular Jewish vision to prevail, one where many national cultures, including his, can thrive, he will need to look for partners outside his own dwindling tribe of secular Zionists.

Bivalent boosters work well…. They are not a panacea, by any means—their efficacy against infections is limited and of short duration, which has been the case for shots since the Omicron variant came along in late 2021. The spike protein of the BA.5 bivalent more closely resembles XBB.1.5 than the Wuhan ancestral spike…. The bivalent BA.5 booster has helped to bridge the big antigenic distance gap from the Wuhan strain to current Omicron subvariants. We’re lucky in the United States to have a big supply and it’s frankly disappointing to see the divisiveness, cherry picking of data, and detractors that defy the body of evidence that has now accumulated.

And I frequently will use an uncommon word that occurs to me as just the right one, even if I’m not at all sure of the dictionary definition when I stop to think about it….
