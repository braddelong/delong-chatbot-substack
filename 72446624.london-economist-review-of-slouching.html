People who are not just my friends and relatives are willing to say that they really like the book! </p><p>Moreover, the <em>Economist </em>review provides a very nice precis:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Economist: </strong><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/08/bradford-delong-reconsiders-the-20th-centurys-economic-history">Bradford DeLong Reconsiders the 20th Century’s Economic History</a>: ‘DeLong seeks to redraw the temporal map…. 1870 to 2010… a coherent whole: the first era… in which historical developments were overwhelmingly driven by economic ones... hurtled towards “economic El Dorado”.... Had the denizens of the 19th century known how fantastically wealthy their descendants would become, many would have supposed those heirs lived amid peace and contentment. Yet building harmonious societies out of material abundance has proved maddeningly difficult...</p></blockquote><p>Thus today, flying back from Boston at the end of the workweek, I feel profoundly blessed by Tykhe. I could have fantasized about a better launch three days for <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em>, but I really could not have rationally expected a better one.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a9f3519-91e3-4563-8f59-83ba44577c31_2070x1218.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a9f3519-91e3-4563-8f59-83ba44577c31_2070x1218.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a9f3519-91e3-4563-8f59-83ba44577c31_2070x1218.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a9f3519-91e3-4563-8f59-83ba44577c31_2070x1218.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a9f3519-91e3-4563-8f59-83ba44577c31_2070x1218.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0a9f3519-91e3-4563-8f59-83ba44577c31_2070x1218.png" width="1456" height="857" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0a9f3519-91e3-4563-8f59-83ba44577c31_2070x1218.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:857,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:292318,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a9f3519-91e3-4563-8f59-83ba44577c31_2070x1218.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a9f3519-91e3-4563-8f59-83ba44577c31_2070x1218.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a9f3519-91e3-4563-8f59-83ba44577c31_2070x1218.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a9f3519-91e3-4563-8f59-83ba44577c31_2070x1218.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>On Amazon, at least, the hardcover peaked at sales rank 121 on September 3. I confess I am very interested in seeing what people do in response to this review, and to all the other reviews when they hit. And then I am also eager to learn what people who are neither my friends or relatives want to say about the book after they read it. And then there is the question of what people who do not read the book think about what, and whether they will actually worry over and change their minds for the better as a result of their thinking and talking about what the book says. That is: I am worried abou the question of the <em>reception</em> of the book. Which reminds me I should write my review of my sometime student Glory Liu’s forthcoming <em>Adam Smith’s America: How a Scottish Philosopher Became an Icon of American Capitalism</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691203814">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691203814</a>&gt; on the reception of Adam Smith in America.</p><p>I would like to take exception to the reviewer’s belief that I portray post-WWII social democracy—the New Deal Order, as Gary Gerstle calls it &lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691006075">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691006075</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SGHRK4H">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SGHRK4H</a>&gt;—as a “happy marriage” between Friedrich von Hayek and Karl Polanyi. I wanted the dominant metaphor to be one of a shotgun marriage, in which John Maynard Keynes was the guy with the shotgun who gave the “blessing”. And is the reviewer just telling the reader that I know whereof I speak because I was there in the 1990s when politicians and policymakers who wished the return of the New Deal Order found themselves trying to maneuver within the Neoliberal one?: </p><blockquote><p>Building harmonious societies out of material abundance has proved maddeningly difficult… a duel between the insights of Friedrich von Hayek… and Karl Polanyi…. [After] the second world war… a happy marriage of Hayek and Polanyi—“blessed by Keynes” (as Mr DeLong puts it),… bore fruit, in the form of a three-decade post-war run of torrid growth…. [Yet] when growth sagged and inflation rose in the 1970s, market-friendly, or “neoliberal”, reforms… of which Mr DeLong was himself a steward… failed to keep growth high and led to worse inequality—yet rich countries pressed on [with them]…. [His] analysis underestimates how deeply neoliberal ideas took root across both the left and the right…  </p></blockquote><p>I think not. Often people from the other side of the Atlantic are too polite. But here I think that readers are definitely being warned that I cease to be a reliable narrator when my own career begins to entangle itself with history, as we come to the fall of the New Deal Order in the late 1970s, and the subsequent Neoliberal Turn. In response, I would ask the reviewer: Who does a better job of describing the fall of the New Deal and the subsequent rise and strange (to my eyes) stubborn persistence of the Neoliberal Order? I am arrogant enough to say that I do as good a job as Gary Gerstle does in his excellent <em>The Rise and Fall of the Neoliberal Order </em>&lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SGHRK4H">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SGHRK4H</a>&gt; (albeit in a much-shorter and hence much-overcompressed form, so my book is not a substitute for Gary’s: readers of my book really need to go read his too). </p><p>The piece of the review I took to heart was the reviewer’s belief that I have failed to thread the Strait of Messina between the Skylla of overstressing social being—forces of production and patterns of life—and the Kharybdis of overstressing social consciousness—what ideas people have and spread about how the world does and should work—and so have had six of my crew devoured by the monstrous heads of Skylla:</p><blockquote><p>If this book has a weakness, it is its occasional reluctance to give credit to people’s beliefs, rather than narrow economic concerns, as a driving force of history…. <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em> shows how economic growth can transform the world. It also demonstrates that material prosperity alone cannot transport people to the promised land. The future may well be shaped by fights about what can.</p></blockquote><p>That is a disappointment. That was not my intention. I will have to go back and see if I can fix the balance.</p><p>But for that it needs to do well enough for Basic to be willing to publish a revised edition!</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/london-economist-review-of-slouching?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/london-economist-review-of-slouching?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Garfield Clinton Reynolds</strong>: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-09-09/the-weekly-fix-the-rate-hike-elephants-are-taking-over-the-room?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=220909&amp;utm_campaign=fixedincome">Jumbo Jumbo Jumbo</a>: ‘Central bankers are mostly busy delivering the rapid policy tightening they gave fulsome notice was on the way when they met at Jackson Hole…</p></li><li><p><strong>Gillian Tett: </strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/091862f9-985f-4769-aa37-1aed32636329">Philosopher William MacAskill</a>: ‘The world is a darker place than it was just five years ago’.

They symbolized survival and embodied a new bureaucratic standard. They wore suits, knew how to listen, and sat behind long desks.

Biden has mostly delivered on his pro-worker growth agenda, with its emphasis on tax fairness and geographically broader economic opportunity…. Michigan is the center of U.S. car manufacturing, an industry that’s been impacted by all the major legislation during the Biden years. That starts with the simple fact that demand for new cars has remained robust throughout the entire period with no collapse of demand. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act invests in creating charging stations for EVs, the Inflation Reduction Act invests in American EV manufacturing, and the Chips Act tries to address a key supply-chain bottleneck that’s held back production. There’s more to Bidenomics than cars, but the auto industry is emblematic of the approach Yellen calls “modern supply-side economics” that aims to harness *all* the major factors of production and not just shower private financial capital with tax incentives…. The Biden administration will probably be haunted for years by the charge that the American Rescue Plan was too large…. What the administration says now, to quote Yellen’s speech, is that “the tail risk of the pandemic’s impact on our economy was a downturn that could match the Great Depression” and a super-sized ARP eliminated that tail risk. I don’t think that fully answers the smarter criticisms of ARP by any means, but it does set up one of the larger themes of Bidenomics, which is prioritizing certain forms of resilience over a narrow sense of efficiency…. <a href="https://jabberwocking.com/the-american-economy-is-a-model-for-the-rest-of-the-world/">America has had the best economic performance in the world</a> over the past few years…</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Matt Levine: </strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-08/gary-gensler-wants-to-regulate-crypto?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=220908&amp;utm_campaign=author_18273090">Crypto Securities</a><strong>: ‘</strong>“A basic premise of Web3… “is that every product is simultaneously an investment opportunity”….
