FIRST: Chinaa€™s Likely Trajectory in Xi Jinpinga€™s Third Term

The Economist joins those who think that Xi Jinping's policies are not sidestepping but instead 
falling deeper into the middle-income trap:

The Economist: How Xi Jinping Is Damaging Chinaa€™ s Economy: a€~Inflexible policies are trumping 
pragmatisma€!. Ideological zeal is behinda€l economic initiatives that form what Mr Xi calls his 
a€oenew development concepta€D, which is meant to address a€oegreat changes unseen in a 
centurya€Da€! to tackle inequality,
monopolies and debt, and to ensure that China dominates new technologies and is fortified against 
Western sanctions.

Yet in all cases Mr Xi believes the party must take the lead, and implementation has been punitive 
and erratic. A blizzard of fines, new regulations and purgesa€!. A savage but incomplete crackdown 
on the property sector, responsible for over a fifth of gdp, has led to a funding cruncha€”one 
reason why housing sales fell by 47% in April
compared with a year earliera€!. Xia€™ s economic modela€! involves expanding the scope of the 
least productive part of the economy: the government-run one.

Chinaa€™ s industrial policy has had formidable successes, for example building a dominant global 
position in advanced batteries. Mr Xi hopes that technology and a new cohort of state investment 
funds will make decision-making more agile. But dona€™ t forget all the dismal failures, from 
rust-belt industries to microchipsa€!. To the
extent it can be discerned from the black box of elite politics, there is no rival to Mr Xi, who is 
68. Yet in the run-up to a party congress that may see him secure power until at least 2027, the 
shortcomings of one-man rule in the worlda€™ s second-largest economy are glaringa€!

It is the fact that I have been wrongly pessimistic about China's growth in the pasta€”and wrongly 
optimistic about its politicsa€”that gives me pause here. Right now I am very pessimistic about 
China's politics and pessimistic about China's economics. I think there is a very good chance that 
it is caught in a middle income trap. But the track record tells me that I
really should not believe myself. Who should I believe instead?

The key immigrant edge in upward mobility in American immigrants is and has always been that 
immigrants are footloose, and so locate in and are willing to move to places where not so much they 
but their children have lots of opportunity. This applies as much to Nigerian-Americans now as to 
Italian-Americans in the 1890s:

Very good piece about how we should not expect a good public sphere to be the application of a 
theory, but rather a combination of tolerance-as-a-treaty and a willingness to learn from others 
who we treat as members of our body politic. Where we run into people whose entire purpose is to be 
intolerant and to exclude, the theory and practice of the liberal public
sphere simply does not work:

I have always thought that there is something very wrong with anyone who pretends (even, or perhaps 
especially, if they convince themselves) to absolute knowledge about First and Last things, and 
about how other people should approach trying to understand them. Wonder, awe, tolerance, and doubt 
is the only proper attitude of a sane non-grifter:

about a lot of flawed men. It isna€™t about flawed leadership or flawed policies. It is a

SUBJECT: DRAFT For My First a€oeSlouchinga€D Talk:

Leta€™ s start with the metaphor of the a€oeeconomic piea€D. If you want to create a utopia, first 
you have to bake a big-enough pie; then you have to slice it equitably, so that everyone has 
enough', then people have to taste ita€”enjoy ita€”use their wealth, their power to manipulate 
nature and to command the attention and assistance of others (for that is what
wealth is) to live lives in which they are healthy, safe, secure, and happy.

Before 1870 we humans simply could not bake a big-enough pie. By 2010 we could. That solving of the 
problem of baking ought, according to the thinking of those living in earlier ages, to have solved 
the big problem in building utopia. Most of the non-utopian features of previous human societies 
had, after all, been a consequence of there not being enough for
everyone; to have enough for yourself, therefore, meant figuring out a way to dominate others and 
appropriate their work. With the coming of a big-enough pie, all of that ought to vanish.

Aristotle, for example, had said that any civilization worthy of the name would have to have 
large-scale slavery unless it had at its disposal a€oethe [robot blacksmith] statues of Daedalus, 
or the tripod [self-propelled serving-carts] of Hephaestus... the shuttlea€! weav[ing] and the 
plectrum touch[ing] the lyre without a hand to guide thema€!a€D Well, now we do.
Yet it turned out that slicing and tasting were problems that were intractable: they were not easy 
or straightforward to solve.

Thus from one perspective my Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the 20th Century is 
about how we solved the problem of baking the piea€”and how we fumbled the solution to the problems 
of slicing and tasting. That is one reading of its big narrative sweep, admittedly with lots of 
subthreads, digressions, and anecdotes along the way.
Why start in 1870, rather than in 1917,1914,1780,1712,1688,1649,1492,1346,1122, 800, or, indeed, 
Octaviana€™ s Second Settlement of -23? Three reasons:

subthreads, digressions, and anecdotes along the way.
Why start in 1870, rather than in 1917,1914,1780,1712,1688,1649,1492,1346,1122, 800, or, indeed, 
Octaviana€™ s Second Settlement of -23? Three reasons:

The first reason is that my cliometric heritage requires me to have a time series. I assert that 
the level of a€cetechnologya€Da€”the value of the stock of useful human ideas about how to 
manipulate nature and productively organize ourselvesa€”is proportional to the average level of 
real income per capita times the square-root of population. And I assert that we have
to hand good enough guesses of world population, and of average world real income per capita. What 
does this time series tell us? It tells us that in the Industrial Revolution century 1770-1870 the 
proportional rate of growth of a€cetechnologya€D deployed and diffused into the world economy was 
0.45%/year, worldwide. That is slow enough that a population
growth rate of 0.9%/year would neutralize any impact of better technology on average incomes. And a 
poor world population could easily grow at 0.9%/yeara€’’doubling every three generationsa€”at a 
stagnant level, and thus never get rich enough to trigger the fertility decline and the demographic 
transition.

The second reason is that the 0.45%/year rate of growth of technology in the Industrial Revolution 
century was not necessarily stable. You can only concentrate the manufacturing of the world in the 
most efficient industrial districts once. You can only mine the really-cheap surface coal where the 
last round of glaciers had scraped all the post-Permian rock off once. It
is possible to envision a counterfactuala€’’William Stanley Jevons in his 1865 The Coal Question 
certainly dida€”in which post-1870 technological progress slows because its continuation along 
previous lines requires a favorable coal abundance and cheapness that is no longer there. A 
slowdown of, say, 1/3 in technological progress post-1870 compared to pre-1870
would have given us in 2010 the technology level we actually reached in 1890, but with a much 
bigger population than the world had in 1890. Such a persistent-steampunk world is imaginable, but 
it is not ours.

The third reason is a quote I ran across from the final post-1870 edition of John Stuart Milla€™ s 
Principles of Political Economy.

Hitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil 
of any human being. They have enabled a greater population to live the same life of drudgery and 
imprisonment, and an increased number of manufacturers and others to make fortunesa€! [and] 
increased the comforts of the middle classesa€!

John Stuart Mill did not think that the problem of enougha€”of baking a big-enough piea€”was on the 
way to being solved in 1870, not with the economic and social institutions and patterns of that 
day.

But we did get a big shift, a crossing of a watershed boundary, around 1870: the coming of the 
industrial research lab, the modern corporation, and full globalization with the global build-out 
of the railroad and the telegraph network, and the iron-hulled screw-propellered ocean-going 
steamship. In terms of our time series, the average rate of growth of technology
deployed and diffused worldwide rapidly jumped up from 0.45%/year to 2.1%/year, where it stayed at 
least until 2010. From a doubling time of 160 years to a doubling time of 34. Malthusian population 
growth could not keep up, and the world became rich enough for the demographic transition to take 
hold, and take hold it did relatively rapidly as such things go.

After 1870 the problem of baking a big-enough pie was on track to being solved. And its solution 
was straightforward: Just let the market economy rip. Let the industrial research labs and the 
corporations do their thing in the context of the world market economy produced by full 
globalization. Industrial research labs, modern corporations, globalization, and the
market economy a€’’which, as that genius Friedrich von Hayek most keen-sightedly observed, is 
tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutionsa€’’proved keys to the lock that had kept humanity 
in its desperately poor iron cage, with the only comfortable ones being the thugs with spears who 
took from the near-subsistence farmers, and those with whom they
shared their extractions. Previously unimaginable economic growth revolutionized human life over 
and over, generation by generation, in not just one episode of Schumpeterian creative destruction 
but in repeated, never-ceasing episodes.

And so humanity should have been able to turn to deal with the problems of slicing, and tasting. 
Certainly it had resources to deal with these problems on a scale that was previously unthinkable.

How should we answer our predecessors? They would look at the extraordinary and amazing 
technological power of our civilization, in which each of us is arguably richer than Nathan Meyer 
Rothschild along the dimension that counts, for even though he was the richest man in the world in 
the first half of the 1800s, he died of an infected abscess in his butt because
he was not rich enough to afford penicillin. They would say: why have you not created a utopia, 
since you have solved the problem of enough and thus also removed all of the additional causes of 
strife that arise because people fight when there isna€™ t enough? They would be very surprised to 
see that the problems of slicing and tasting have flummoxed us.

What happened? This, I think, my book has nailed. Letting the market economy rip to solve the 
problem of making enough had consequences. The repeated, sequential, Schumpeterian 
creative-destruction economic revolutions meant that all was solid melted into aira€”all 
established patterns and orders were steamed awaya€”and while men (and women) were not
compelled to face with sober senses their real conditions of life and relations with one another, 
they did have to try to build new institutions to manage the problems and opportunities of 
production, distribution, and utilization that the onrushing technological cornucopia brought.

That idiot Friedrich von Hayek thought the unleashed market would do the whole job, The market 
would produce enough. True, it could not produce a€oesocial justiceaCD, but we should not ask for 
social justice. Why not? Because attempting to achieve it would undermine the market economya€™ s 
ability to do what it could do, and put us on, well, The Road to
Serfdom. a€oeThe market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the marketa€D had to 
be our only gospel.

But, as that genius Karl Polanyi put it in his book The Great Transformation, the a€oestark 
utopiaa€D of von Hayek's catallaxy was unsustainable. People will not stand for being told that 
there are no rights but property rights. They instead insist that a€cethe market was made for man, 
not man for the marketa€D. The marketaC™ s treating those whom society saw as
equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought social explosion after explosion, blocking the road 
to utopia. People saw themselves as deserving communities, incomes, and stability. They needed 
their Polanyian rightsa€”to economic security, to an income level proportional to what they 
deserved, that other people should have income levels proportional to what they
deserved too, in a connected society that gave them respect and placea€”plus that you should have 
some power in society even if you had no wealth. Trying to bring about the stark utopia of market 
society would thus face explosions, and be overwhelmed by social-political movements that sought 
social justicea€’’which might be a very inegalitarian kind of social
justice, because it would give people not equal shares but rather what those making the rules 
deserved.

Thus the book wound up with a Polanyi-Left Neoliberal grand narrative

Since 1870 humansa€’’Theodore Roosevelt, John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt, Vladimir Lenin, Margaret Thatcher, Deng Xiaoping, and othersa€” tried to think up 
solutions. They dissented from a€oethe market givetha€!a€D constructively and destructively. They 
demanded that the market do less, or different, and other
institutions do more. Keynes whimpered that if only governments allowed his technocratic students 
to conduct a sensible monetary policy along with a "somewhat comprehensive" socialization of 
investment, that everyone would have a job and technology plus compound interest would wreak 
marvels and rock-bottom interest rates would "euthanize" the rentiersa€”
so   that they could use their money social power only at the cost of spending down their capital, 
and so relinquishing it. Thus in the not-very-long-run, Keynesian technocrats could solve the 
problems of production and distribution, leaving humanity to grapple with its real problem: that of 
utilization of our wealth to create a truly human world.

Perhaps humanity, did indeed come close to an institutional-societal setup to tackle the problems 
of slicing and tasting. Post-WWII "social democracy" in the rich countries was a good try. 
Keynesian focus on full employment (and low interest rates to make amortizing the WWII-era debt 
easy), Beveridgian equality-through-redistribution (and public provision), plus a
little Pigovian externality-compensation produced the Thirty Glorious Years.

But somehow social democracy failed its sustainability test, and was replaced by neoliberalism, 
which stubbornly persists in spite of its failure to fulfill any of its promises except that it 
would make the rich much richer with much more social power. Society may not know what "social 
justice" is, but it knows that it manifestly does not consist of giving benefits to and
making life easy for those it assesses as "undeserving".

And so the wheel turned. Here we are. Why are not the good people of the global north happier and 
more satisfied with the techno-utopian marvels that have been delivered to them? Why has great 
wealth in historical perspective produced not reduced but increased economic anxiety? And how does 
that economic anxiety get transformed into ethno-nationalist fear and
rage? And how is it that the neoliberal ordering of society still survives, given that it has 
fulfilled exactly none of the promises made by its original salesmen, save for making the rich 
richer and society more economically unequal? Our current situation: in the rich countries there is 
enough by any reasonable standard, and yet we are all unhappy, all earnestly seeking to
discover who the enemies are who have somehow stolen our rich birthright and fed us unappetizing 
lentil stew instead.

What do we do next? This my book punts. That is for a younger generation than my failed one to 
decide. Global warming. Ethno-national terrorism on all scales from the individual AR-15 to the 
Combined Arms Army. Revived fascism. Technokleptocracy. I do quail.
As John Maynard Keynes wrote back in 1924:

[That] assumes... a plan exists.... [But] we lack more than usual a coherent scheme of progress, a 
tangible ideal. All the political parties alike have their origins in past ideas and not in new 
ideas.... No one has a gospel. The next move is with the head...

Now I could have written a very different book.

After all, only one of the many threads that were the warp of the ideal book I first wrote in my 
minda€™ s eye survives as the booka€™ s Grand Narrative.

In the beginning, the book was going to have a number of important threads. It was to be a 
science-and-technology booka€”a Michael Polanyi book. It was going to be an 
engineers-and-entrepreneurs booka€”a David Landes. It was going to be a Schumpeterian 
creative-destruction-and-finance-and-industry book. It was going to be a Keynesian macro-and-moral-
philosophy book. And it was going to be a reacting-to-a€oeRed-Viennaa€D booka€”a Karl 
Polanyi-and-friends book. Of all of these Grand Narratives that I had originally hoped to thread 
throughout the book, only the last of thesea€”the Karl Polanyi Grand Narrativea€”survived the 
writing and editing process.

That means that my aspirations for the book have shrunk: my hope now is that my book will do for 
Karl Polanyi something like what Charlie Kindlebergera€™ s Manias, Panics, and Crashes did for 
Hyman Minskya€”that is, make him comprehensible, arresting, immediate, and important, by providing 
lots of narrative examples for which the underlying theory can
serve as a thematic lens.

And I do confess that right now I am most interested in what people can convince me that I have 
gotten very wrong here. The book does have an overly-simplistic stripped-down pseudo-Polanyiesque 
Grand Narrative at its heart. And while that may have been (but probably was not) adequate for a 
1940s-era understanding of the dynamic of fascism, really-existing
socialism, and classical (or, rather, semi-classical pseudo-) liberalism then midway through the 
Long 20th Century; it is wholly inadequate for grasping the political-economy dilemmas of the world 
today!

Aristotle, for example, had said that any civilization worthy of the name would have to have 
large-scale slavery unless it had at its disposal a€oethe [robot blacksmith] statues of Daedalus, 
or the tripod [self-propelled serving-carts] of Hephaestus... the shuttlea€! weav[ing] and the 
plectrum touch[ing] the lyre without a hand to guide thema€la€D Well, now we do.
Yet it turned out that slicing and tasting were problems that were intractable: they were not easy 
or straightforward to solve.

Thus from one perspective my Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the 20th Century is 
about how we solved the problem of baking the piea€”and how we fumbled the solution to the problems 
of slicing and tasting. That is one reading of its big narrative sweep, admittedly with lots of 
subthreads, digressions, and anecdotes along the way.
Why start in 1870, rather than in 1917,1914,1780,1712,1688,1649,1492,1346,1122, 800, or, indeed, 
Octaviana€™ s Second Settlement of -23? Three reasons:

The first reason is that my cliometric heritage requires me to have a time series. I assert that 
the level of a€cetechnologya€Da€”the value of the stock of useful human ideas about how to 
manipulate nature and productively organize ourselvesa€”is proportional to the average level of 
real income per capita times the square-root of population. And I assert that we have
to hand good enough guesses of world population, and of average world real income per capita. What 
does this time series tell us? It tells us that in the Industrial Revolution century 1770-1870 the 
proportional rate of growth of a€cetechnologya€D deployed and diffused into the world economy was 
0.45%/year, worldwide. That is slow enough that a population
growth rate of 0.9%/year would neutralize any impact of better technology on average incomes. And a 
poor world population could easily grow at 0.9%/yeara€’’doubling every three generationsa€”at a 
stagnant level, and thus never get rich enough to trigger the fertility decline and the demographic 
transition.

The second reason is that the 0.45%/year rate of growth of technology in the Industrial Revolution 
century was not necessarily stable. You can only concentrate the manufacturing of the world in the 
most efficient industrial districts once. You can only mine the really-cheap surface coal where the 
last round of glaciers had scraped all the post-Permian rock off once. It
is possible to envision a counterfactuala€’’William Stanley Jevons in his 1865 The Coal Question 
certainly dida€”in which post-1870 technological progress slows because its continuation along 
previous lines requires a favorable coal abundance and cheapness that is no longer there. A 
slowdown of, say, 1/3 in technological progress post-1870 compared to pre-1870
would have given us in 2010 the technology level we actually reached in 1890, but with a much 
bigger population than the world had in 1890. Such a persistent-steampunk world is imaginable, but 
it is not ours.

The third reason is a quote I ran across from the final post-1870 edition of John Stuart Milla€™ s 
Principles of Political Economy.

Hitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil 
of any human being. They have enabled a greater population to live the same life of drudgery and 
imprisonment, and an increased number of manufacturers and others to make fortunesa€! [and] 
increased the comforts of the middle classesa€!

John Stuart Mill did not think that the problem of enougha€”of baking a big-enough piea€”was on the 
way to being solved in 1870, not with the economic and social institutions and patterns of that 
day.

But we did get a big shift, a crossing of a watershed boundary, around 1870: the coming of the 
industrial research lab, the modern corporation, and full globalization with the global build-out 
of the railroad and the telegraph network, and the iron-hulled screw-propellered ocean-going 
steamship. In terms of our time series, the average rate of growth of technology
deployed and diffused worldwide rapidly jumped up from 0.45%/year to 2.1%/year, where it stayed at 
least until 2010. From a doubling time of 160 years to a doubling time of 34. Malthusian population 
growth could not keep up, and the world became rich enough for the demographic transition to take 
hold, and take hold it did relatively rapidly as such things go.

After 1870 the problem of baking a big-enough pie was on track to being solved. And its solution 
was straightforward: Just let the market economy rip. Let the industrial research labs and the 
corporations do their thing in the context of the world market economy produced by full 
globalization. Industrial research labs, modern corporations, globalization, and the
market economy a€’’which, as that genius Friedrich von Hayek most keen-sightedly observed, is 
tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutionsa€’’proved keys to the lock that had kept humanity 
in its desperately poor iron cage, with the only comfortable ones being the thugs with spears who 
took from the near-subsistence farmers, and those with whom they
shared their extractions. Previously unimaginable economic growth revolutionized human life over 
and over, generation by generation, in not just one episode of Schumpeterian creative destruction 
but in repeated, never-ceasing episodes.

And so humanity should have been able to turn to deal with the problems of slicing, and tasting. 
Certainly it had resources to deal with these problems on a scale that was previously unthinkable.

How should we answer our predecessors? They would look at the extraordinary and amazing 
technological power of our civilization, in which each of us is arguably richer than Nathan Meyer 
Rothschild along the dimension that counts, for even though he was the richest man in the world in 
the first half of the 1800s, he died of an infected abscess in his butt because
he was not rich enough to afford penicillin. They would say: why have you not created a utopia, 
since you have solved the problem of enough and thus also removed all of the additional causes of 
strife that arise because people fight when there isna€™ t enough? They would be very surprised to 
see that the problems of slicing and tasting have flummoxed us.

What happened? This, I think, my book has nailed. Letting the market economy rip to solve the 
problem of making enough had consequences. The repeated, sequential, Schumpeterian 
creative-destruction economic revolutions meant that all was solid melted into aira€”all 
established patterns and orders were steamed awaya€”and while men (and women) were not
compelled to face with sober senses their real conditions of life and relations with one another, 
they did have to try to build new institutions to manage the problems and opportunities of 
production, distribution, and utilization that the onrushing technological cornucopia brought.

That idiot Friedrich von Hayek thought the unleashed market would do the whole job, The market 
would produce enough. True, it could not produce a€oesocial justicea€U, but we should not ask for 
social justice. Why not? Because attempting to achieve it would undermine the market economya€™ s 
ability to do what it could do, and put us on, well, The Road to
Serfdom. a€oeThe market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the marketa€D had to 
be our only gospel.

But, as that genius Karl Polanyi put it in his book The Great Transformation, the a€oestark 
utopiaa€D of von Hayek's catallaxy was unsustainable. People will not stand for being told that 
there are no rights but property rights. They instead insist that a€cethe market was made for man, 
not man for the marketa€D. The marketaC™ s treating those whom society saw as
equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought social explosion after explosion, blocking the road 
to utopia. People saw themselves as deserving communities, incomes, and stability. They needed 
their Polanyian rightsa€”to economic security, to an income level proportional to what they 
deserved, that other people should have income levels proportional to what they
deserved too, in a connected society that gave them respect and placea€”plus that you should have 
some power in society even if you had no wealth. Trying to bring about the stark utopia of market 
society would thus face explosions, and be overwhelmed by social-political movements that sought 
social justicea€’’which might be a very inegalitarian kind of social
justice, because it would give people not equal shares but rather what those making the rules 
deserved.

Thus the book wound up with a Polanyi-Left Neoliberal grand narrative

Since 1870 humansa€’’Theodore Roosevelt, John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt, Vladimir Lenin, Margaret Thatcher, Deng Xiaoping, and othersa€” tried to think up 
solutions. They dissented from a€oethe market givetha€!a€D constructively and destructively. They 
demanded that the market do less, or different, and other
institutions do more. Keynes whimpered that if only governments allowed his technocratic students 
to conduct a sensible monetary policy along with a "somewhat comprehensive" socialization of 
investment, that everyone would have a job and technology plus compound interest would wreak 
marvels and rock-bottom interest rates would "euthanize" the rentiersa€”
so   that they could use their money social power only at the cost of spending down their capital, 
and so relinquishing it. Thus in the not-very-long-run, Keynesian technocrats could solve the 
problems of production and distribution, leaving humanity to grapple with its real problem: that of 
utilization of our wealth to create a truly human world.

Perhaps humanity, did indeed come close to an institutional-societal setup to tackle the problems 
of slicing and tasting. Post-WWII "social democracy" in the rich countries was a good try. 
Keynesian focus on full employment (and low interest rates to make amortizing the WWII-era debt 
easy), Beveridgian equality-through-redistribution (and public provision), plus a
little Pigovian externality-compensation produced the Thirty Glorious Years.

But somehow social democracy failed its sustainability test, and was replaced by neoliberalism, 
which stubbornly persists in spite of its failure to fulfill any of its promises except that it 
would make the rich much richer with much more social power. Society may not know what "social 
justice" is, but it knows that it manifestly does not consist of giving benefits to and
making life easy for those it assesses as "undeserving".

And so the wheel turned. Here we are. Why are not the good people of the global north happier and 
more satisfied with the techno-utopian marvels that have been delivered to them? Why has great 
wealth in historical perspective produced not reduced but increased economic anxiety? And how does 
that economic anxiety get transformed into ethno-nationalist fear and
rage? And how is it that the neoliberal ordering of society still survives, given that it has 
fulfilled exactly none of the promises made by its original salesmen, save for making the rich 
richer and society more economically unequal? Our current situation: in the rich countries there is 
enough by any reasonable standard, and yet we are all unhappy, all earnestly seeking to
discover who the enemies are who have somehow stolen our rich birthright and fed us unappetizing 
lentil stew instead.

What do we do next? This my book punts. That is for a younger generation than my failed one to
