•  Paul Krugman: a€™ Zach Carter has a characteristically fascinating article on Milton Friedman 
and his fading legacya€!. Monetarisma€l is dead, and should never have had the influence it did. 
James Tobin
was right in 1970: to the extent that there was a correlation between monetary aggregates and GDP 
(there hasna€™ t been much of one in recent decades), Friedman had the causation reverseda€!

Paragraphs:

Robert Farley: With Focus on China, US Senate Passes Major Industrial Policy Bill: a€™ If the bill 
ultimately passes both houses of Congress, it will represent a major shift in how the United States 
government manages its
relations with the tech sectora€!. The bill is intended to foster the reinvigoration of the 
manufacturing side of the U.S. technology sectora€!. The Senate version faces criticism regarding 
the lack of significant oversight of the
technology companies that will benefit from the bill. However, the extent of bipartisan support in 
the Senate suggests a big enough coalition to survive negotiations between the House and Senate 
versionsa€!. Both
Republican and Democrats displayed an allergy to industrial policy after the 1970s; that both now 
seem interested in government intervention is a huge change from the long-standing consensusa€!. 
Whether this amounts to a
new a€oeCold War Consensusa€D is altogether uncertain, but the fact that concern over China can 
bridge one of the most poisonous political divides in U.S. history should probably cause some 
concern in BeijingaCI

Shac Ron: a€™ Arm64 didna€™ t appear out of nowhere. Apple contracted ARM to design a new ISA for 
its purposes. When Apple began selling iPhones containing arm64 chips, ARM hadna€™ t even finished 
their own
core design to license to others. Arm64 is the Apple ISA, it was designed to enable Applea€™ s 
microarchitecture plans. ThereaC™ s a reason Applea€™ s first 64 bit core (Cyclone) was years ahead 
of everyone else, and it
isna€™ t just caches. ARM designed a standard that serves its clients and gets feedback from them 
on ISA evolution. In 2010 few cared about a 64-bit ARM core. Samsung & Qualcomm, the biggest mobile 
vendors, were
certainly caught unaware by it when Apple shipped in 2013. Apple planned to go super-wide with low 
clocks, highly OoO, highly speculative. They needed an ISA to enable that, which ARM provided. Ml 
performance is not
so because of the ARM ISA, the ARM ISA is so because of Apple core performance plans a decade 
agoa€!

David Glasner: Whata€™ s so Great about Supply-Demand Analysis?: a€~This analysis is the bread and 
butter of economicsa€!. There is much to be said for the analysisa€!. But ita€™ s also important to 
understand its
limitations, and, especially, the implicit assumptionsa€! It focuses attention on the idea of an 
equilibrium price at which all buyers can buy as much as they would like, and all sellers can sell 
as much as they would likea€!.
That equilibrium price, aside from enabling the mutual compatibility of buyersa€™ and sellersa€™ 
plans to buy or to sell, has optimal propertiesa€!. The chief problem with supply-demand analysis 
is that it requires a strict
ceteris-paribus assumption^!. But another implicit assumption underlies supply-demand analysis: 
that the economic system starts from a state of general equilibriuma€l. Finally, and perhaps most 
problematic, comparative
statics    is merely a comparison of two alternative equilibria, neither of which can be regarded 
as the outcome of a theoretically explicable, much less practical, process leading from initial 
conditions to the notional equilibrium
statea€!. Ita€™ s important to understand [that]a€! the relationship between the formalism and the 
real world is tenuousa€!

Ezra Klein : Interviews Betsey Stevenson: a€™ "We got three months left of these extra $300 
payments. I dona€™ t think anybody is sitting at home and thinking, aw, I just am going to live 
high on the hog on these
unemployment insurance payments. I think theya€™re thinking, my job is miserable and Ia€™m going to 
take this nice time for a break. And Ia€™m going to look right now while I can for something 
better. And I
guarantee                                                                                           
         you that we could get rid of all of unemployment insurance tomorrow, and we wouldna€™ t 
put 7.5 million people back to work overnighta€!. It might even be OKa€! appreciate the fact that 
people have had a
really hard year. People who have white collar jobs with good incomes feel like theya€™ ve had a 
hard yeara€!. Well, if youa€™re barely putting food on the table, your job became enormously more 
miserable, and then you
turn on the news and you see people yelling at you because youa€™ re not getting back to work fast 
enough. Thata€™ s just a lack of appreciation of the humanity of lower wage workersa€! If UI is 
having an effect, ita€™ s
smalla€!. Do we really need to deny benefits to millions of people because wea€™re worried about 
whether we might have had a few thousand more jobs?a€!

Jeet Heer: Tucker Carlson Is a Made Man: a€~Fox News host loves to rail against the mainstream 
press but enjoys the protection of media clubbinessa€!. Smith rightly notes that Carlsona€™ s 
a€cedouble-gamea€D is
hardly newa€!. Right-wing demagogues battling the media has always been akin to professional 
wrestlina€!. Access journalism has always been morally dodgy but in the case of protecting a figure 
like Carlson (not to
mention Trump) shouldna€™ t it be seen as beyond the pale? And who are these journalists who are 
shielding Carlson?a€!

Sheri Berman: Threats to American Democracy: a€~Even though Trump lost the election, American 
politics has not returned to a€~normala€™ . Indeed, Trumpa€™ s removal has made clearer the nature 
and severity of the
threat to American democracy. We now have a two-party system where one of the two parties 
prioritises partisanship over democracy and is accordingly willing to promote policies that would 
seriously, if not fatally, impair
the functioning and legitimacy of democracya€™ s core foundationa€”free and fair electionsa€!

Ezra Klein: AMA!: a€~Too much feedback about me and it gets in my head in bad ways. Compliments 
roll off me, criticisms stick, and in both cases, ita€™ s all just weird exacerbations of my ego. I 
already get more public
feedback then I think human beings are tuned to absorb, so I try to limit all the additional stuff 
about me that I can. But I appreciate that you all like or hate the show enough to be here!a€!
