Why the 1/6 Hearings Have Damaged Trump

By most measures, the January 6th Committee hearings have been an unalloyed success. The 
Committeea€™ s first hearing drew six million more viewers than any of this yeara€™ s NBA Finals 
games. Ita€™ s a big deal for a Congressional hearing to overshadow Steph Curry. Polls also show 
that many people are paying close attention and the percentage of Americans who believe Donald 
Trump should be charged with a crime is rising. A Navigator Poll
found a six-point increase in the number of Republicans and Independents who believe Trump should 
be charged with a crime after being informed of the revelations from the Committeea€l

The end of the conservative age

Sometimes, a thing becomes visible only as it nears its enda€”or at least we may hope that the 
long, oppressive era of conservatism through which we have been living will soon breathe its last.

As I see it, the reason to worry about stack is not anything that it has done, but rather the 
pressures to aggregate, monetize, and then abandon its commitment to providing the infrastructure 
for a thoughtful public sphere in order to generate clickbait-rage. The hope is that that is only 
the failure mode of advertising-supported media. The fear is that it is going to be a constant 
feature of the attention economy. In that case, the only platforms that are actually good,
for the world will be those that tie themselves to the mas and remain concerned only with covering 
their costs and attaining influence rather than generating money for investors:

Saladin Ahmed: Launch Week: Dona€™ t You Have Concerns wiith Some of the Other Writers Who Are

platform with dark forces. Ia€™ m talking about on a physical, gut-deep levela€!. [But] complicity 
is everywhere. How do you
make good work that actually reaches people in a world like that without doing harm? How do you own 
what your labor produces and make sure those you work with are paid fairly? All of the answers have 
their grim side. That said, and to be perfectly clear, I completely understand and respect anyone 
not agreeing with the compromises I makea€!. There are valid reasons to take exception toa€”even to

The very sharp Josh Barro believes that the CDC is blowing it again a€“ once again, treating the 
American citizenry like cattle to be misled, because that helps drive them in the right direction 
right now. And I agree with Josh that this is a horrible mistake, and they ought to have learned 
from Covid:

Josh Barro: Public Health Officials Should Be Clearer About Who Isna€™ t at Risk for Monkeypox'. 
a€~A general pattern of dishonest framing by public health authoritiesa€!. If youa€™ re at 
above-average risk, theya€™ 11 gladly tell you so, in hopes it will get you to focus on their 
advice. But if youa€™ re at below-average risk, they dona€™ t want to harp on that too much, 
because then you might not do what they tell you. And of
course, ita€™ s likely some gay men who actually are at elevated risk will see the messaging 
intended for the whole public, and theya€™ 11 come away misinformed and under-alarmeda€!. The main 
thing straight people should be afraid of is what this episode has shown about how little our 
government agencies have learned from COVIDa€!

In the old days, authoritarianism could be stable. The problems that society had to solve emerged 
slowly, and even an ossified system. Hostile to accurate information, could gradually adjust to 
deal with them, most of the time. Keeping your eye on the ball meant keeping the flow of resources 
to the elite going so that the elite would mobilize to keep the regime in power. Perhaps the piece 
of change became too fast for this to work starting with the French
revolution. But the pace of change is much too fast now. And Xi Jinping's drawing on traditional 
Chinese patterns of governance is, I think, likely to bring an end to the Chinese development 
model. Noah Smith watches:

Noah Smith: China Is Flailing: a€~The leadership is frantically trying to fine-tune its economic 
policies, but it isna€™ t helpinga€!. In the middle of 2021, China embarked on a series of policy 
experiments that have brought its economy crashing back to Eartha€! an arbitrary crackdown on the 
consumer interneta€! an attempt to curb the real estate sectora€! a a€cezero-Covida€D policya€!.

Heavy-handed crackdowns didna€™ t work, and neither did half-hearted reversals of those crackdowns. 
So what can China do to get growth going again?a€! [There] area€! sensible policiesa€!. The problem 
is that Chinaa€™ s decision-making process is currently impaired at the highest levels. 
Considerations like nationalism (in the case of vaccines), distrust of the private sector (in the 
case of IT), and a fear of being seen to shift course
are  silencing the governmenta€™ s more reasonable voices. And to be honest, ita€™ s hard to escape 
the conclusion that a lot of this is coming directly from the topa€!
