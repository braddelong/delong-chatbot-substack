Edward Lempinen: Prices Are Spiking for Homes, Cars, & Gas. Dona€™ t Be Alarmed, Economists Say: 
a€~The cost of homes is soaringa€”and so is the cost of the lumber to build them. The price of cars 
and gas are up sharply, too, as are prices for products ranging from corn to computer chips. Now 
worries are rising that as the post-pandemic economy comes back to life, a sustained surge of 
inflation could undermine the recovery.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported yesterday that the Consumer Price Index rose 5% in May, 
following a 4.2% jump in April. But at UC Berkeley, high-level economists are offering some calming 
advice: A measure of inflation is inevitable as the U.S. economy comes back online, but it will 
likely be modest. And it will almost certainly blow over as the economy stabilizes.

a€oeAlarmists point to past periods of very high inflation, so we imagine inflation of 5%, 6%, 
maybe higher,a€D said Berkeley professor Maurice Obstfeld, former chief economist for the 
International Monetary Fund. a€oeBut I dona€™ t think ita€™ s very likely that we would get much 
above 3% after a couple of years.a€D

a€oePeople have this idea that inflation is something we have to be frightened about,a€D added 
Berkeley economist Yuriy Gorodnichenko. a€oeWhen we have some inflation, that means we have a lot 
of action in the economy, and the economy is recovering. Ita€™ s good. Ita€™ s a sign of health.a€! 
It doesna€™ t mean wea€™ 11 return to the 1970s.a€D

The UC Berkeley economics department features some of the nationa€™ s most influential scholars in 
monetary and economic policy, many of them with experience at high levels of government, 
international institutions and academic centers. In a series of interviews, they cited a range of 
challenges as policymakers try to restore some normalcy to the economya€’’continuing high 
unemployment, for example, and an economic realignment away from brick-and-
mortar retail stores.

Inflation forecasts are inherently uncertain, but they said today a€™ s higher prices are likely to 
be a blip that lasts a year or two, at most.

The new inflation numbers are roughly double the annual inflation rate of the past decade, but far 
below inflation that averaged 7.9% annually in the 1970s, before peaking at nearly 14% in 1980.

That inflation caused deep, long-term damage to the U.S. economy. Tens of millions of Americans saw 
dramatic erosion in the value of their earnings and savings. Businesses faced price increases and 
broad uncertainty that made it difficult to budget for the costs of supplies and labor. 
Unemployment rose and stayed high for years.
Without doubt, the 1970s economy left scars that remain painful four decades latera€”and, the 
Berkeley scholars say, that likely accounts for some of the alarm in recent weeks.

For generations, Econ 101 students have learned that inflation is a straightforward process: When 
an economy is strong, a lot of people are working, and their wages are rising. That means more 
people with more money are competing to buy apples or pickup trucks or homes. The competition 
causes price inflation.

But the economic conditions caused by the pandemic have been unlike anything in modern U.S. 
history. In effect, the lockdown put much of the economy in an induced coma so that, where 
possible, workers would stay home and be protected from the coronavirus.

The lockdown saved thousands of lives, and government relief programs prevented mass poverty. 
Still, restaurants, tourism and retail sales took a massive hit. Rental car companies sold off 
their fleets, rather than let vehicles sit idle. Microchip manufacturers reduced production. 
Housing starts plunged. Hundreds of thousands of businesses reduced or suspend operations, which 
meant reduced hours or furloughs for millions of workers. Other businesses closed
permanently.

As more Americans get vaccinated and health threats retreat, it would seem simple to flip the 
switch and turn the economy back on, said Berkeley economist J. Bradford DeLong, who served as 
deputy assistant Treasury secretary in the administration of President Bill Clinton.

a€oeYou give people lots of purchasing power, and you say, a€~Go out and spend it,a€™ a€D DeLong 
explained. a€oeAnd if there are lots of people running around waving money in the air saying, a€~I 
want to buy things,a€™ businesses will respond, and you will get back to full employment quite 
quickly.a€D
In reality, however, ita€™ s neither easy nor smooth.

a€oeRight now, wea€™re coming out of a plague year,a€D said DeLong. a€oeWea€™re in some place wea€™ 
ve never been before,a€D

a€oeBottlenecksa€D are the problems most visiblea€”and most vexinga€”to many consumers, and 
Berkeley economists say bottlenecks are driving much of the preoccupation with inflation in 
politics and the press.
As the economy restarts, demand for new cars and trucks is up sharply. But a shortage of microchips 
has slowed production. The result: Prices are up sharply.

The pandemic forced the shutdown of many lumber mills, and construction activity slowed 
dramatically as workers were sent home. Consumers meanwhile stopped eating at restaurants and 
cancelled vacations; they shifted their priorities to new homes or vacation homes. With similar 
results: The cost of timber needed for new construction is up 180%, construction has slowed, and 
home prices are going through the roof.
This signals runaway inflation, right? Probably not

While the price increases are sobering, the Berkeley economists expect inflation arising from the 
pandemic to be temporary. Timber production will increase, and prices will fall. Chip manufacturers 
are ramping up production, and new-vehicle inventories will rise. As mills and factories come back 
online and workers return, the economy will return to a more natural balance.
Still, the experts are cautious about blanket predictions. Why? In part, at least, because 
inflation isna€™ t the linear cause-and-effect phenomenon typically described in Econ 101.

Berkeley economist Emi Nakamura, winner of the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal in 2019, last 
year joined with Berkeley colleague JA3n Steinsson and others in research on the a€oePhillips 
curve,a€D an influential model for understanding inflation. In simple terms, the Phillips curve 
holds that, in a robust economy with low unemployment, workers will seek higher wages, and firms 
will raise prices.
But in their paradigm-challenging work, Nakamura, Steinsson and their colleagues demonstrated that 
employment levels had little bearing on the high inflation of the 1970s. Far more important, they 
found, were the expectations by business owners and consumers that inflation, in the long run, 
would rise.

In effect, the owners and consumers didna€™ t trust policymakers to control inflation. But while 
inflation has been contained for 40 years, the inflation of the 1970s has had long-lasting 
influence on our expectations, Berkeley economists say. Today many political 
leadersa€’’predominantly Republicansa€”are using those fears to attack President Joe Biden and the 
Democratsa€™ pandemic recovery and infrastructure investment programs.
Gorodnichenko and others at Berkeley acknowledge that some credible economists see higher risks of 
inflation. But the political attacks, they say, often are not based on sound economic analysis.

The Federal Reserve Board, which has primary influence in shaping the nationa€™ s policies on 
inflation, is led by Chairman Jerome Powell and Vice Chairman Richard Claridaa€”both appointees of 
former President Donald Trump. a€oeTheya€™re Republicans,a€D Gorodnichenko said, a€oeand they say 
inflation is not a problem.a€D
Today, the pandemic has created a range of conditions that suggest long-term inflation is not a 
riska€”but which make the future especially hard to predict.

The economy still has about 8 million fewer jobs than at the start of the pandemic.

a€oeTo put this into perspective,a€D Gorodnichenko said, a€oethe employment-to-population ratio we 
have today is at the level that we had at the worst period of the Great Recessiona€D that started 
in 2008.

Obstfeld, a member of California Gov. Gavin Newsoma€™ s Council of Economic Advisers, cites a more 
technical factor: While the May Consumer Price Index pegged inflation at 5%, a different measure, 
the a€oemedian CPI,a€D was just 2.1% for both May and Aprila€”and economists believe that measure 
is a more accurate signal of future inflation.

Republican political leaders are blaming Democratic President Joe Biden for accelerating inflation.

Donald Trumpa€”and the Fed says inflation will not be a long-term problem. (Photo courtesy of the

Those numbers suggest that inflationary pressures are modest. Other dynamics, however, are 
unprecedented, reflecting deeper changes in the economy that may have accelerated with the 
pandemic.

For example, DeLong asked, how do you get 8 million or 10 million people back to work quickly? 
Policymakers have to be careful to maintain pandemic financial supports while theya€™re still 
needed, but also must end them so they dona€™t become an incentive to stay unemployed.

At the same time, he said, millions of jobs will have to shift from fading sectors to those that 
are growinga€”for example, from conventional retail sales to fields related to online shopping. But 
if those new jobs dona€™t pay well, people wona€™t take them. a€oeThat means that the average level 
of wages is going to go up,a€D he said, a€oeand therea€™ s going to be inflation.a€D
Debt is another concern, said Obstfeld. Both the government and businesses have had to increase 
borrowing during the pandemic, and that, too, could contribute to inflationary dynamics.

Obstfeld and others said the Fed will face a critical challenge: allowing prices to rise as the 
economy comes back to life, but then raising interest rates carefully to cool the economy and slow 
inflation as the economy gets stronger. Success in that effort also may determine whether Americans 
come to expect sustained higher inflation, but Nakamura and Obstfeld said it would usually take an 
extended period of high inflation before consumer expectations began to
shift.

Among U.S. economists, therea€™ s a spirited debate over whether the Fed will be able to fine-tune 
its intervention enough to slow inflation without causing a recession. At Berkeley, economists tend 
to think ita€™ s possible.

DeLong anticipates that any modest inflation, as the pandemic fades, will be a€oejust a blip 
followed by stability.a€D

a€oeBut that is something that is going to be decided in the next 18 months or two years,a€D he 
said. a€oeThat will be the end stage of a very complicated and uncertain and confused process of 
trying to get the economy reopened and get back to full employment as quickly as possible.a€D
