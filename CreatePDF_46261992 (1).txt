How Are We to Understand China’s  “Standing Up” since 1978?


China today: uneven
development:

1. IB people in the interior, living
like Peru...

2. 300M people along the coasts,
living like Poland...

3. 60M people in the growth poles
living like Spain:

• Shanghai

• Beijing

• Pearl River Delta

China today: most successful
development ever:

• if only because of its immense
scale: 1.4B people

• (2) & (3) are the world’s greatest
manufacturing export machine

• (much more closely
integrated into the world
economy than to the interior)

• The world’s second-largest high-
tech sector

• Hardware growth-pole
supremacy (in some aspects)
in  ZSC

First: Trying to Grasp the Reality of China Today

Like me, Noah Smith is trying to become, not a China expert, but less China-ignorant. I would add 
Barry Naughton <https://gps.uesd,edu/facuity-directory/barry-naughton,html> and Yingyi Qian 
<http://voxchina.org/show-4-41 ,html> to the first rank of those with accessible expertise on the 
Chinese economy today:

Noah Smith: Six Books on China: a€~If you want true expertise on that countrya€™ s economy, I 
suggest checking out:

• Dan Wang <https: //twitter.com/danw wang>,

• Damien Ma <https://twitter.com/damienics>,

• Shuli Ren <https://twitter.com/shuli ren>,

• Liqian Ren <https://twitter.com/fiqian ren>,


• Victor Shih <https://twitter.com/vshih2>, and

• George Magnus <https ://twitter.com/georgemagnus 1 >a€!.

[But] I try to reada€!. So I thought Ia€™ d write some reviews of the most recent books Ia€™ ve 
reada€!.

(1) Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China, by Leslie T. Chang 
<https://archive.org/details/factorygirlsfromOOOOchan>a€!. Really the standout of the buncha€! the 
quality of the writinga€! grubby intermediate stage, with all its hideous inequality and desperate 
exploitationa€! the reward[s] of hypergrowtha€!.

(2) China in Ten Words, by Yu Hua <https://archive.org/details/chinaintenwords008800>a€! about the 
Cultural Revolution^! a strangely detached tone toward those terrible events, a little like Kurt 
Vonnegut does in Slaughterhouse F/ve<https://archive.org/details/slaughterhousefiOOOOvonn_s 1 h9>a€ 
1.

(3) The Party: The Secret World ofChinaa€™s Communist Rulers, by Richard McGregor 
<https://archive.org/details/partysecretworldOOrich>a€!. 1984a€! turneda€! into a detailed how-to 
manuala€!. At its heart, the CCP is just a mafiaa€! that has grown to an absolutely stupendous 
sizea€!.

(4) Red Flags: Why Chinaa€™s Xi is in Jeopardy, by George Magnusa€!. Prophecies that have now 
largely come to pass. George Magnus has been following Chinaa€™ s economy for decadesa€!. 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBWPWM1 vo!4>

(5) The Myth of Chinese Capitalism: The Worker, the Factory, and the Future of the World, by Dexter 
Roberts <https://www.dexterroberts.com/the_myth_of_chinese_capitalism the_worker the factory 
and_the future_of the wo_.htm>a€!. It is about how completely and utterly capitalist China became 
during the decade of the 2000sa€!.

(6) The Hundred-Year Marathon: Chinaa€™ s Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global 
Superpower, by Michael Pillsbury <https://archive.org/details/hundredvearmaratOOOOpill>a€!. The 
least helpfula€! annoying cultural essentialisma€! rela[ing]e every Chinese plan or tactic or 
worldview to some concept from the Warring States perioda€!.

So there you have it: Five books about China. Ia€™ ve already got four of the next five lined up: 
Chinaa€™ s Gilded Age: The Paradox of Economic Boom and Vast Corruption, by Yuen Yuen Ang <https 
://www. youtube .com/watch?v=7kaItpDD_Hs>. Chinaa€™ s Economy: What Everyone Needs to Know, by 
Arthur Kroeber <https: //china-economy-book ,com>. One
Child: The Story of ChinaaC™ s Most Radical Experiment, by Mei Fong <https://vimeo.com/149053910>. 
Leftover Women, by Leta Hong <https://archive.org/details/leftoverwomenresOOOOhong>. If you have 
any suggestions for what the fifth should be, please let me know! It would be nice to read 
something very recent, that deals with the changes being wrought
under  Xi Jinpinga€!

Six books on China

I dona€™ t consider myself an expert on China, by any stretch of the imagination. If you want true 
expertise on that countrya€™ s economy, I suggest checking out Dan Wang, Damien Ma, Shuli Ren,

My big problem is that I have been wrong about China for forty years now. I have 
beena€’’consistently a€”a believer that Chinaa€™ s current development model (whatever it happened 
to be at the time) had five, maybe ten years to run. But, I have always believed, the closure of 
society that the maintenance of party domination requires will break the developmental model. 
Energies that would
otherwise be entrepreneurial will be devoted to ascending within the party, controlling non-party 
elements, and bribing the party to leave your business alone. And that is when those with 
entrepreneurial energy do not decide to just leave, and set up shop elsewhere. Chinaa€™ s 
development model was, after all, only rescued in its first decade by the existence of Hong Konga€™ 
s entrepreneurial
class, and its willingness to play ball. It was only rescued in its second decade by the existence 
of Taiwana€™ s entrepreneurial class, and its willingness to play ball. It was only rescued in its 
third decade by the willingness of the WTO to play ball with Chinaa€™ s development model. And it 
has only been rescued in its fourth decade by various low-quality investment bubbles.

Still, the system has held together. China has managed to mobilize resources on a truly titanic 
scale. And it has created a bourgeoisiea€”a bourgeoisie that has not felt that it has the need or 
the power to flex muscles for political dominance, but has been willing to focus, on an individual 
case-by-case basis, in cementing protective links with their party-side patrons.

I keep reaching for historical analogies, and I don't find any good ones. The rising bourgeoisie of 
Europe's imperial-commercial age led to the development of the absolutist monarchies that, in 
Engelsa€™ s famous formulation, held the balance between their aristocratic-military-police-control 
classes and their wealth=creation classes: the a€oerelative autonomy of the stateaCD. But it was 
those
monarchs that ceded power to and promoted the rise of the bourgeoisie most rapidly that were by far 
the most successful in the long run. The relative autonomy of the state was real, but, where it was 
exercised in favor of the aristocracy, consequences for development or destructive for national 
development.

(Prussia is the only exception. But that is because in 1814 Austrian Foreign Minister Metternich 
handed the Junkers and the Hohenzollerns the Rhineland and the Ruhr. Metternich, fighting the last 
war, thought it very important that Prussia be more focused on containing France than Austria. Big 
long-run mistakea€”not in Metternicha€™ s day, but a generation after his forced retirement. Do
note that, had I been on Henry Kissingera€™ s dissertation committed, I would have rejected the 
dissertation without a chapter on the long-run consequences for the Austrian Empire of handing the 
most economically dynamic regions of greater Germany to Prussia.)

And later analogies than in the 1500-1770 imperial-commercial age? 1870-1914 Wilhelmine Germany is 
obvious, but totally inadequate.

And, without good historical analogies to rest myself on, I confess that my own attempts to grasp 
the reality of China in my mind have all proven very inadequate, although I have tried:

Is Azis the Moment My Long-Run China Growth Pessimism Will Be Right?; & BRIEFLY NOTED: For 
2021-12-08 We

First: For 40 years now, I have been a short-run China bull and a long run China bear. It has 
seemed clear to me, at every point in time, China has a working short-run development model, and 
that the legacy of the Maoist version of really-existing socialism had left it with enormous but 
easily correctable economic deficienciesa€’’deficiencies that could be quickly and 
straightforwardly repaired
to give China a much more prosperous economy over the next five years. But it has also seemed clear 
to me that the systemic and governance deficits of China would make successful continuation of that 
development model beyond a 10-year horizon very unlikely indeed. Thus I have, at every point in 
time, thought I saw clearly that the odds were that, within a decade in what was then the future,
China would join the typical emerging-market economy, and find itself unable to make significant 
further progress in convergence toward the global north norma€!

Doris Geide-Stevenson & Alvaro La Parra Perez: a€~Based on an extensive survey of the members of 
the American Economic Association this paper compares consensus among economists on a number of 
economic propositions over four decades. The main result is an increased consensus on many economic 
propositions, specifically the appropriate role of fiscal policy in macroeconomics
and issues surrounding income distribution. Economists now embrace the role of fiscal policy in a 
way not obvious in previous surveys and are largely supportive of government policies that mitigate 
income inequality. Another area of consensus is concern with climate change and the use of 
appropriate policy tools to address climate changea€!

The mitochrondrial-y-chromosome DNA pattern is a thing: over the past 100,000 years or so, 
effective male population sizes 1/3 of effective female population sizes, with this enormous 
relative depression in the effective male population size down to 1/20 of the female population 
size centered around 5000 years ago. Over our entire recent, history, y-chromosome variant lineages 
are not
emerging as fast as they should if as many males are breeding as femalesa€”suggesting moderate 
polygyny. And things go totally haywire in the period centered on 5000 years ago. Or so we think:

A move from 1/3 to 1/20 is a proportional move of ln(2). A thousand years is roughly 25 
generations. If this extra extinction process takes 4000 years, that means that each generation 
there is an extra 2% chance that your entire y-chromosome lineage group gets wiped out completely. 
Violent death, castration, or mate-deprivation have to differentially happen to men. And if, say, 
two-thirds of
these nasty things that men do to one another happen within the y-chromosome lineage group (because 
that is who is nearly), that means that 8% of men each generation have to wind up mate-deprived in 
ways that hit their entire lineage group. That is what you need. And that needs to go for 4000 
years in order to wipe out all except ln(-2) of the expected male y-chromosome lineages. And this
is in addition to the factors that keep the a€oenormala€n effective male population size at 1/3 of 
the female.

It is hard to see how this leads us to any story other than a€oecattle, women, slaves, and
