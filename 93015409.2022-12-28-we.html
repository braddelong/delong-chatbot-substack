In fact, I think it is somewhat worse. Fox News and company are clear to me. But it is not clear to me why the mainstream is not better. I only know that is it not.</p><p>For example: McConnell’s aim since election day 2008 has been to deny Democratic presidents any legislative victories whatsoever. The business of the country can, he thinks (with notably rare exceptions) be done when a Republican is in the oval office. Legislative gridlock is the first step to painting the Democratic president as a failure, and then winning congressional majorities and the presidency:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Michael Grunwald:</strong> ‘Biden says that during the [2008-2009] transition, he was warned not to expect any cooperation on many votes.<strong> </strong>“I spoke to seven different Republican Senators, who said, `Joe, I’m not going to be able to help you on anything,’ he recalls. His informants said McConnell had demanded unified resistance. “The way it was characterized to me was: `For the next two years, we can’t let you succeed in anything. That’s our ticket to coming back,’” Biden says. The vice president says he hasn’t even told Obama who his sources were, but Bob Bennett of Utah and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania both confirmed they had conversations with Biden along these lines…</p></blockquote><p>And then last week we had:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Steve Clemons: </strong><a href="https://www.semafor.com/newsletter/12/23/2022/semafor-principals-big-scandal-weird-scandal-jan-6-santos">As is so often the case, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. got what he wanted:</a> ‘The Senate minority leader ignored the jeering from his right and helped push through the $1.7 trillion omnibus bill that rained billions more on the Pentagon than the White House had requested, secured aid for Ukraine, and kept down domestic spending.... It was part of a successful strategy to pursue some of his own self-interested goals, like keeping centrists happy so they would protect the filibuster...</p></blockquote><p>But what McConnell wanted was gridlock—“we can’t let you succeed in anything. That’s our ticket…” </p><p>He could not get gridlock, because gridlock was unacceptable to the unified Democratic caucus. </p><p>So McConnell settled. And then was double-crossed by Manchin, or fell victim to wishful thinking. He thought that he had killed all components of Build Back Better in exchange for allowing CHIPS to go forward, and then found himself watching not just CHIPS but the IRA go down the tracks.</p><p>And yet Steve Clemons portrays it as McConnell’s “successful strategy”.</p><p>Is he dumb? Is he in the tank?</p><p>I really do not know why he has to burnish the image of Mitch McConnell as all-controlling Svengali.</p><p>At least with Maggie Haberman, we don’t have to wonder why she does what she does:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Cassidy Hutchinson</strong>: ‘His phone is ringing. I look down at his phone. It’s Maggie Haberman calling him. And I looked at Stefan, and I said, “Stefan, did you tell Maggie Haberman that we were meeting with the committee today?” <br><br>And he’s like, “No, no. Maybe that’s not what she’s calling me about.” <br><br>And I said, “Stefan, did you tell Maggie that we were meeting with the committee today?” <br><br>And he said, “No, no, but I should probably answer to see if she knows, right? I should answer.” <br><br>And I said, “Stefan, no. I don’t think you should answer that call. She probably wants to know if we met with the committee today.” <br><br>He said, “Cass, I’m just going to answer. It will just be 2 seconds. I just want to find out what she’s going to talk to me about.” <br><br>He answers. I can’t hear what she’s saying, but I hear Stefan say, “Yeah, yeah, we did just leave her third interview. You can put it out, but don’t — don’t — don’t — don’t make it too big of a deal. I don’t think she’ll want it to be too big of a deal. All right. Thanks.” <br><br>And I said, “Stefan, was that Maggie Haberman asking about my interview?” <br><br>And he said, “Yeah, but don’t worry. She’s not going to make it a big deal.” <br><br>I said, “Stefan, I don’t want this out there.” <br><br>He said, “Don’t worry. Like, Maggie’s friendly to us. We’ll be fine.” <br><br>So I was just like, “Whatever”…</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>MUST-READ: <strong>&amp; We Have a Rainy Season Here in California!</strong></h3><p>Hooray!</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/NWSBayArea/status/1608111445748887557&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Preliminary (not official) rainfall🌧️totals looking back 48 hours, ending 6 am this morning.\n\n<span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>#cawx</span> &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;NWSBayArea&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;NWS Bay Area 🌉&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Wed Dec 28 14:43:40 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/FlEovVBaEAYqY8R.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/T5bUSKpOLQ&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:0,&quot;like_count&quot;:5,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/NWSBayArea/status/1608111445748887557" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/NWSBayArea.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @NWSBayArea" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">NWS Bay Area 🌉 </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@NWSBayArea</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">Preliminary (not official) rainfall🌧️totals looking back 48 hours, ending 6 am this morning.
