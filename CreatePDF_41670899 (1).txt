Key Insights:

1. I do not understand how the Chinese economy works.

2. The Chinese economy is an odd combination of market and party in which the party has enormous 
reach and control, but somehow that has not triggered the a€oesoft budget
constraintaCD problems of the Soviet model.

3. Financial constraints are not reala€”a government that wants to can evade them in its management 
of the economy.

4. Real resource constraints are, however real: finance does not bind because it is true that what 
we can do, we can afford; but it is also true that what we cannot do, we cannot afford.

5. You can hide for a while from real resource constraints by bubble-overvaluing the low-value 
infrastructure and real-estate investments that you are making, but you cannot run.

6. There is lots to read that is good; consult these show notes.

7. HEXAPODIA!!

Evergrande: why most analysis is dead in water and how best to understand and navigate whata€™ s 
happening? Both denialists and alarmists are getting it wrong. Leta€™ s start by
understanding this: what is happening is the result of a CCP-initiated policy change to curb 
leverage. 1/N
