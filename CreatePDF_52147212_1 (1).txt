FIRST: Elliptically Answering a Question About My a€oeSlouching Towards Utopiaa€d:

AVAILABLE

FOR


AN ECONOMIC HISTORY
OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY

J. BRADFORD DELONG

PREORDER

The principal focus of this a€~Stack for the next five months is flogging my book-to-be 
<https://bit.lv/3pP3Krk>, after all. And people are talking about it on the Internet:

Nick S.: "I've always associated Brad with the phrase, a€~equitable growtha€™ and [his] history 
<https://bit.lv/3pP3Krk> makes me realize how recent a concern that is. Based on the storya€! the 
possibility of equitable growtha€”of a rising tide lifting all boatsa€”is only 150 or 200(?) years 
old.

I think about that and I am struck, on one hand, that it's no wonder that it's difficult to 
achieve, if we only have a couple centuries of collective history to draw upon to figure out how to 
achieve equitable growth. On the other hand, it makes me feel more optimistic (or not) that the 
future will be less analogous to the past than I might have thoughta€”the broad era we are living 
in is different from the majority of human history.
Is that a reasonable conclusion, or is Brad stacking the deck for that interpretation?a€D

& I reply:

Brad DeLong: Say, rather, that if you wanted to live a comfortable life before 1870, humanity was 
so poor that the only way to do this was to figure out some way to take a substantial share of 
stuff other people were making and grab it for yourselfa€”and then find some way to make that 
grabbing stable, and also to convince yourself that you deserved to grab so that you could then be 
happy with yourself about doing so. And that requirement for how to live a
comfortable lifea€”it, to sav the least, nrofoundlv marked humanitv and its historv.


Now and in the futurea€”since 2010a€’’however, we are rich enougha€’’technology is advanced enough, 
growth is fast enough, and women have other ways of gaining social power than being the mothers of 
sons enough that Malthusian pressures no longer keep us so poora€”that we can all lead comfortable 
Eves, in the sense that it is straightforward to produce enough, so our collective economic 
problems are ones of distributing the enough and of using it
appropriately to make us happy rather than miserable.

In between 1870 and 2010a€”during the long 20th century a€’’things were both marvelous and 
terrible, but in the context of previous human history more marvelous than terrible. The coming of 
the industrial research lab; of the modern corporation; and of the globalization triple of the 
iron-hulled ocean-going screw-propellered steamship and of the railroad, of the submarine and land 
telegraph cable, and of the open world economya€’’those removed the final
barriers to the rapid discovery, development, deployment, and then diffusion of new technologies: 
new and better ways of manipulating nature and organizing humans to make stuff and do things. After 
1870, the deployed-and-diffused technological prowess of humanity doubled every generation, a pace 
previously unimaginable and unimagined. That meant that the global market economy revolutionized 
the economy and then re-revolutionized it again, once
every generation, in a process of profound and repeated creative destruction in which all 
established patterns and hierarchies were steamed away.

Technological progress and creative destruction under the aegis of the market economy solved the 
problem of not being able to make enough stuff for all. But it left the problems of distribution 
and of utilization untouched. Moreover, 140 years of repeated creative destruction of economic 
patterns upended all of the patterns and bargains that did guide distribution and utilization, and 
then upended them again. This led to great fear among the powerful: their
relative status and power depended on those patterns. And this led to great anxiety among the 
powerless: they could dream of utopian changes, but they did fear that the market economy would 
take away what little they had.

People think they have rightsa€”to a stable community that validates and nurtures them, to an 
income commensurate with what they deserve, and to a stable life. But the market economy does not 
recognize those rights. The market economy recognizes only property rights. Your social power is 
your wealth and is only your wealth. And you only have wealth if the property rights you possess 
are to things useful in producing commodities for which the rich have a
serious jones.

Friedrich August von Hayek, that genius-idiot Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde figure of the long 20th century, 
saw the power and productivity of the market economy unleashed and preached subservience to the 
market: "the market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the market". To seek for 
anything other than the expansion of production, to seek for "social justice" and resolving the 
problems of distribution and use would, he claimed, destroy the ability
of the market economy to solve the problem of production and create enough.

Karl Polanyi said: that simply will not work. Market-worship to create a stark utopia in which the 
only rights are property rights is inhuman, and humans will not stand for it. Attempting to enforce 
a system that destroys all rights other than property rights, all of "society" and all dreams of 
social justice, will call forth an unstoppable counterreaction of some kind. Humanity must try to 
resolve the problems of distribution and use, for: "the market is made for man,
not man for the market". But how is the market made for man? And in what way?

John Maynard Keynes said: All we need are a few technical and technocratic adjustments to the way 
the market economy works, and we can all but guarantee that everyone will have a job and see 
themselves as useful. Moreover, these proper technocratic adjustments to the system will produce 
the euthanasia of the rentier, interest rates would be so low that the only way the unproductive 
rich can exert their social power would be by spending-down their
capital, and so joining us non-rich. Plutocracy would not be a permanent problem. With the problems 
of production and distribution solved, there would remain the problem of utilization: how to use 
our resources to enable all of us to live happy and fulfilled lives, rather than have us hag-ridden 
by necessity, greed, and fear of poverty. But a world in which that is the problem is a much better 
world.

But it did not work out, did it? We did not run or march forward, but only slouched, didn't we? And 
what did we, over 1870 to 2010, slouch towards? Was it utopia? Or was it something else?

Heebee-Jeebee: Equitable Growth'. a€~as a society, dona€™t we immiserate ourselves pretty routinely 
in the absence of material hardship? Ia€™m picturing the goalposts moving for what women ought to 
be able to accomplish, as feminism takes hold over the past hundred years. I would absolutely 
prefer to have my current set of freedoms and rights, but that doesna€™t mean that each gain 
hasna€™t been exploited and reduced in
its possible impact. I think that when Trump was elected, it fundamentally broke my belief in 
a€oethe arc of history is long buta€!a€D kind of framing in favor of a€oeWhat nature doesna€™ t do

Nick S.: a€~I am not surprised by the fact that we have not yet built a utopia (even with levels of 
wealth that would have stunned previous generations). What I found really striking about Brad's 
argument (and which I tried to explain in the O[riginal ]P[ost], but might not have done a good 
job), is the way in which it breaks the idea of a smooth arc of history. The world of Jane Austen 
is recognizable in many ways but, practically
speaking, in 1810 it wouldn't have been possible to distribute the products of technological 
progress in such a way that everyone could lead a comfortable life. The level of technology 
relative to the population was not enough to support thata€”but now it is. We haven't figured out 
how to do that yet (or lack the will), but it's both heartening and concerning to realize that we, 
as a species, haven't had that much time to work on the
problema€!

Paragraphs:

Clever thoughts from Chad Orzel. We are built to listen to and keep track of about 150 different 
people. With more than that number start yammering at us, we group them into categories in order to 
keep the number of types of people we have to keep track of down to 150 or so. And this produces 
major errors in our social cognition:

Chad Orzel: Email, Social Media, & Toxic Flattening'. a€~When that hits your email inbox or Slack 
notifications, though, those individual scheduling decisions get flattened into an amorphous 
a€ceThey.a€C All the emails from all the people who kept working after you went to bed, or started 
before you woke up look the same, and the result can be overwheming. If youa€™re not careful to 
disaggregate these, working asynchronously
can create a false impression that everybody is working basically around the clock. This is a 
variant of the flattening of ideological groups that happens a lot on social media, and creates the 
impression that the political poles are full of self-contradicting idiotsa€!

I had forgotten this, from the late and much-missed Iain M. Banks, I believe from the novella The

the audience he deserved, and thus in which it would have been broadly recognizable, I would have 
been very strongly tempted to choose this as the epigraph for my forthcoming Slouching Towards
