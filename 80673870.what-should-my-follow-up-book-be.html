In each edition of the book he included the following passage:</p><blockquote><p>Hitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of any human being. They have enabled a greater population to live the same life of drudgery and imprisonment, and an increased number of manufacturers and others to make fortunes. They have increased the comforts of the middle classes. But they have not yet begun to effect… great changes in human destiny… &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.36903">https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.36903</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>1870 was not that long ago. For somebody like my son, born in 1990, it was the date of birth of his great-great grandparents. From 1870 to today is five generations. From -6000 to 1870 is 260 generations. Moreover, there was about as much proportional technological progress from -6000 to 1870 as there has been from 1870 to today. Yet between -6000 and 1870 typical human standards of living increased by only perhaps 40% as population grew from 5 to 1300 million—260-fold. By contrast between 1870 and today humanity’s collective standard of living has grown ten-fold as human population has grown from 1.3 to 7.8 billion—six-fold.</p><p>That population growth is the answer to the question of why humanity’s productivity and standard of living has risen so much since 1870, while it rose so little before. Before 1870, that greater population puts more pressure on resources caused nearly all of pre-1870 technological progress to be eaten up by the need to compensate for the smaller farm sizes and poorer near-surface ores available to the average member of the growing population. Before 1870, technology lost its race with fertility. After 1870, it won it.</p><p>Thus the first questions about the pre-1870 economy present themselves: </p><ul><li><p>Why was technological progress so slow before 1870? </p></li><li><p>And why was population growth so relatively fast, by the yardstick of the contemporaneous rate of technological improvement, over the nearly 8 millennia between -6000 and 1870? </p></li><li><p>Why, and how? </p></li></ul><p>Put a pin in those questions.</p><p>That technology lost its race with fertility over -6000 to 1870 profoundly shaped all of human history up to 1870. Technology’s loss of its race against fertility meant that the pre-1870 world was one of dire poverty: there was absolutely no chance, back then, for humanity to be productive enough to bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have <em><strong>enough</strong></em>. People, however, still desperately wanted <em><strong>enough</strong></em> for themselves and their families. What to do? Since you could not produce with high enough productivity, you chose—if you could—the alternative: to take. You established yourself as part of the elite, élbowed competitors for membership out of the way, dominated, and took: history was then a coalition of thugs-with-spears plus their accountants, bureaucrats, and propagandists. They lived the (relatively) good life that we remember as the high civilizations of the past. The strong did what they wished, while the weak suffered what they must.</p><p>This book is about those processes, and those years during which humanity was ensorcelled by the Devil of Malthus…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Very Briefly Noted:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>App Economy Insights</strong>: <a href="https://appeconomyinsights.substack.com/p/tesla-bigger-than-apple">🚘Tesla: Bigger than Apple?🚘</a>: ‘Why Elon Musk believes Tesla will be a $4 trillion company…</p></li><li><p><strong>Tracy Alloway &amp; Joe Weisenthal</strong>: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-10-21/that-sound-you-hear-is-a-reshuffling-of-global-capital?cmpid=BBD102122_oddlots&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=221021&amp;utm_campaign=oddlots#xj4y7vzkg">That Sound You Hear Is a Reshuffling of Global Capital</a>… </p></li><li><p><strong>Wikipedia</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram">Sankey diagram</a>…</p></li><li><p><strong>Michael A.
