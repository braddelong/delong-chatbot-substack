FIRST: Would Somebody Please Tell Me What Number I Should Pencil in for the a€oeNatural Rate of 
Inflationa€d?

What do you have to do to keep your philosophera€™ s license in good standing? Asking for Matt 
Yglesiasa€!

a€oeThe Feda€! should have started moving to tighter money sooner.a€D To get from a description of 
what happened in the world to an evaluation of an actora€™ s actionsa€”to get to that s^ow/<Za€”you 
need three things:

1. A metric mapping outcome-states-of-the-world onto their desirability (either their desirability 
in the eyes of the actor or in the eyes of some impartial spectator, depending on the scope of that 
"should).

2. A counterfactual as to what would have been the outcome-state-of-the-world had the actor in fact 
done what you say they shouldhave done.

3. A switch telling us whether this is a look-back or a look-forward should'. Is it an ex-ante 
shoulda€”the actor had or did not have but could have gathered the information to let them conclude 
that the counterfactual world would have been a better outcome-state than what actually happened? 
Or is it merely a look-back ex-post should: given what was later revealed (but that the actor at 
the time did not know and could not have learned then) it would
have been better to take the counterfactual action?

Matthew Yglesias: The Problem with Flexible Average Inflation Targeting: a€~What the Fed needs to 
do nexta€!. Frankly, the Fed kind of dropped the ball on inflation. They were too slow to react 
last year and should have started moving to tighter money sooner. But whata€™ s past is past, and 
now the Fed has to thread the needle and bring inflation back down without triggering a recession. 
Fortunately, Powell has acknowledged his
oversight and the Fed raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point last week, with six more rate 
hikes expected in 2022a€!

The problem with flexible average inflation targeting

You may not have noticed at the time, given everything else going on in the world, but back in 
August of 2020, something very important happened: Jay Powell gave a speech in which he announced 
that the Federal Reserve had updated its strategic frameworka€!

I dona€™ t see any of those anywhere in Matta€™ s argument. It is true that he is not an economist, 
and was not an economics major, and was not even a social studies major. But these counterfactual, 
evaluation-framework, and potential-knowledge issues are philosophersa€™ bread-and-butter.
As to the counterfactual, one possibility would be one in which inflation was still below 2%, and 
in which the labor-market recovery from the Plague Recession of 2020 was as slow as the 
labor-market recovery from the Great Recession of 2008:

FRED  - Employment-Population Ratio • 25-54 Yrs./80.5*100


Recovery of prime-age employment from recession, start of recession = 100, Great Recession of 2008 
and Plague Recession of 2020
Would that be a better world? Should the Fed have done that? I really do not think soa€!

It is at this point that I do have to admit that the economists I most respect are not doing much 
better:

Emi Nakamura: Noah Smith: Interview. a€~The recent increase in inflation is much more than 
historical experience would have predicted (which is about an increase in inflation of 1/3% for 
every 1% decrease in unemployment)a€!. Supply shocks are back!a€! There has been a historic shift 
in demand from services to goods: <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=LnYU>a€ 1 [and] secular 
shifts in demand can lead to the same
inflationary pressures as supply shocksa€L Thirda€! a very rapid recovery and a lot of government 
supporta€!. Households have a huge buildup in savings chttps:Z/fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Lo 1 
j>, and spending this down is no doubt contributing to demand. Conceptually, one might expect these 
demand pressures to be captured by the unemployment ratea€!. One thing that hasna€™ t contributed 
much to inflation so far is an
unhinging                                                                                           
                                                                                                    
          of longer run inflation expectationsa€!. Market expectations are predicated on what the 
market expects the Fed to do. There is a self-fulfilling prophecy element in this, as in many 
things in macroeconomics. So long as the market expects the Fed will do what it takes to contain 
inflation, we wona€™ t see much movement in longer run inflation expectations. The Fed is working 
very hard to preserve this. But we cana€™ t take
this for granteda€!

One way to put it is this: There has been much discussion of the NAIRU or the a€oenatural rate of 
unemploymenta€Da€”the unemployment rate below which you should not try to push the economya€”but 
there has been little discussion of any a€oenatural rate of inflationa€Da€”the rate of inflation 
below which you should not try to push the economy. All competent macroeconomists agree that there 
is a positive natural rate of inflation: we have high costs of
nominal wage cuts in terms of the destruction of worker-boss trust, very high costs of bankruptcy 
workouts, and very very sticky nominal debts. Given those institutional-structural features of the 
economy, a positive natural rate of inflation to grease the gears of the labor market and of the 
debt market is an inescapable necessity. But how high is the natural rate of inflation in normal 
times? And how does it alter in times of supply shocks and of sectoral­
rebalancing demand shocks? Not enough economists have spent not enough time on these issues.

My view is that there is noa€”nonea€”zeroa€”case for not accommodating supply and 
sectoral-rebalancing shocks until they threaten to destabilize long-run inflation expectations. 
After they threaten to do so, there is a trade-off to be dealt with. Before they threaten to do so, 
there is not.

SUBJECT: John Kenneth Galbraitha€™s Eclipse

Bob Reich at coffee rightly thwacked me for not making enough of John Kenneth Galbraith in my 
Slouching Towards Utopia, forthcoming on September 6 <https://bit.ly/3pP3Krk>. So as a gesture in 
partial atonement I republished my piece on John Kenneth Galbraith, written fifteen or so years

Andrei Shleifer once asked me why there were no Galbraithians among economists. My quip in response 
was that he was too much a€oebe clevera€D and too little model-building, and that you neededa€”as 
Harry Johnson once saida€”to offer a straightforward path to work your epigones could do, like 
estimating another money-demand function, or consideringanother form of monopolistic-like 
competitionin international trade. But John Maynard Keynes
was also too much a€oebe clevera€D and too little model-building, and that did not hurt him. 
Indeed, a€oemathing up Keynesa€D, as Larry Summers likes to put it, has been perhaps the largest 
productive sector in macroeconomics for going on 80 years now. So what gives with Galbraith?

Now an astute young economists’’many astute young economistsa€’’could devote themselves to 
a€oemathing upa€D The Affluent Society and The New Industrial State chapter-by-chapter. Indeed, 
that people are is one reading of pieces of the behavioral-economics and imperfect-competition 
threads of articles appearing in journals today.

Fifteen years ago I said that three things had robbed Galbraith of his political-economy relevance, 
or perhaps effectiveness: (a) the faded memory of the Great Depression meant that the middle class 
and high-wire entrepreneurs had forgotten that they and the working class had common interests in 
the New Deal order, (b) small-government neo- and paleo-liberals prevent the legislativemajorities 
that could fuel a newNew Deal oranother Great Society, and (c)
while the solid, racist Democratic South could be populist, the solid, racist Republican South will 
never be. Plus the extraordinary durability of the Horatio Alger myth means that even an economics 
based on solidarity rather than enterprise by rugged individuals is received by too many Americans 
as if it were pronounced in an incomprehensible foreign language.

And so now I am actually more hopeful than I was fifteen years ago. The rise of what Jacob Levy 
calls a€oethe multiculturalism of feara€D seems to me to have made Americaa€™ s people more likely 
to understand, sympathize, and resonate with Galbraitha€™ s messagea€”if only they would read them.
But if even I decide that I would rather have Karl Polanyi than John Kenneth Galbraith as my 
rhetorical north star by which to steer, what are the chances that Galbraitha€™ s works will get 
under peoplea€™ s noses again to any large degree?

Paragraphs:

A beautiful piece on a very important story. In 1500 Castile was at the center of a web of 
economic, political, and military forcesa€”the conductor of an orchestra of the division of labor, 
power, exploitation, and accumulation that stretched from Augsburg to Peru. In 1600 it was nearly 
the hegemonic power in Europe. And by 1800 not only was it all gone, but Spain was much weaker than 
if the Spanish Seaborne Empire had never been. Why? And how? This
provides a very good knife to open that oyster:

Carlos Javier Charotti & al:. American Treasure & the Decline of Spain: a€~Spain was one of the 
worlda€™ s richest countries around 1500. Two centuries later, it was a backwater. This column 
discusses the long-run impact of the influx of precious metals from the New World on the economic 
development of Spain. Using an augmented synthetic control methodology, the authors show that in 
the long run the growth and price level
trajectories evolved dramatically different in Spain relative to other Western European nations. 
Spain initially boomed but suffered from high inflation and became poorer as the result of a 
resource curse which had economic and political dimensionsa€!

Remote work is horrible for people who do not yet have a social network with which to do their job, 
and bad for people who need to extend their social network to do their job. Ita€™ s only an 
unmitigated good for people like me, over 60, for whom the sun has clearly passed the zenith and 
for whom the task is not to expand but to hang on to an already existing social network. And yet 
the pressures for remote worka€™ s permanence are turning out to be very
strong indeed, for it turns out it is something that people with considerable social power value a 
lot:

curling up with a textbook, using it to create a sub-Turing instantiation of the mind of the
