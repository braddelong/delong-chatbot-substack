Paul’s view, which I think is absolutely correct, is that Keynes himself was a Chapter 12 Keynesian and that the Book 1 aspects, while there, were definitely secondary to his vision. But the dominant strains in American macroeconomics have always found Book I to resonate much more with them than Chapter 12—when they have found value in Keynes at all. And Bill is right here to stress that the best parts of Zack Carter’s excellent book are about how Samuelson’s Book I-focused “neoclassical synthesis” was extremely vulnerable to the assault from the right for which understanding what was going on in the macroeconomy was secondary to undermining the intellectual underpinnings of the New Deal:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Bill Janeway</strong>: <em>The Master and the Prodigy</em>: ‘Carter’s most original and substantial contribution… [is] a detailed account of how the genuinely radical “Economics of Keynes” was transformed into the narrowly constrained and conventional “Keynesian economics,” which was more palatable for policymakers in post-war capitalist America, but also more vulnerable to attack by economic libertarians starting in the 1970s…. Samuelson’s solution was to construct a “neoclassical synthesis.”…. With the state operating as a visible hand to do the work of Say’s Law, microeconomics could revert to the pre-Keynesian model of perfect competition as the mode by which to allocate resources efficiently. But Samuelson turned his back on the behavioral micro-foundations of&nbsp;<em>The General Theory</em>…. By abandoning Keynes’s behavioral micro-foundations, Samuelson… left his neoclassical synthesis open to a radical assault from the right…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.billjaneway.com/the-master-and-the-prodigy">https://www.billjaneway.com/the-master-and-the-prodigy</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Remember that reporters trying to cover Ferguson were faced not just with lies from the police and abuse from the right, but with contempt and scorn from their own colleagues and editors:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Duncan Black</strong>: <em>Objectitudinal</em>: ‘Lowery was very young and sent by the WaPo to cover Ferguson and got nothing but constant shit from his editor and coworkers for attempting to accurately cover the situation: Wesley Lowery: "Hopefully this settles the industry debate about whether reporters are being ‘activists and not journalists’ by pointing out that coverage is often too deferential to police and that the media’s role should be to provide rigorous, skeptical interrogation of police claims…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.eschatonblog.com/2022/05/objectitudinal.html">https://www.eschatonblog.com/2022/05/objectitudinal.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>But… but… but… If one is playing for the long game, soft power is what matters for any nation that thinks it has a special, holy mission. Alexander I’s army can march beneath the Arc de Triomphe in 1814, and he can dance in the Palais du Luxembourg. But the tools for Russia to deploy are much more Pushkin and Tolstoy than tanks and missiles:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Stephen Kotkin</strong>: <em>Russia After The War</em>: ‘Russia is a remarkable civilization: in the arts, music, literature, dance, film. In every sphere, it’s a profound, remarkable place—a whole civilization, more than just a country. At the same time, Russia feels that it has a “special place” in the world, a special mission. It’s Eastern Orthodox, not Western. And it wants to stand out as a great power.
