Beth Moll: Unvaccinated Are 5X More Likely to Catch Delta, 11X More Likely to Die'. a€~Three fresh 
CDC studies show vaccines holding up against deltaa€!. Fully vaccinated people are about five times 
less likely to become infected with delta, 10 times less likely to be hospitalized with COVIDa€“19 
from delta, and 11 times less likely to die from the varianta€!. Fully vaccinated people were about 
11 times less likely to get an infection in the pre-delta
period, compared with the unvaccinated (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 7.8 to 15.8). That 
ratio dropped to 4.6 less likely in the post-delta period (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 
2.5 to 8.5). For hospitalizations prior to delta, fully vaccinated people were 13 times less likely 
to wind up in the hospital than the unvaccinated (confidence interval of 11.3 to 15.6). After 
delta, that ratio dropped slightly to 10 times less likely (confidence interval of 8.1
to 13.3). The fully vaccinated were 16.6 times less likely to die of COVIDa€“19 prior to delta 
(confidence interval of 13.5 to 20.4) and 11.3 times less likely to die after delta (confidence 
interval of 9.1 to 13.9)a€!. For vaccine protection against infection, they estimated that 
effectiveness dropped from 91 percent to 78 percent with delta. For protection against 
hospitalizations, effectiveness appeared to go from 92 percent to 90 percent, and for death, from 94
percent to 91 percent. One troubling note was that the declines in protection were more pronounced 
in older age groups, with those ages 65 and older seeing larger dropsa€!

Conor Kelly: a€™ A pretty massive gap in COVID case rates has opened up between counties that voted 
for Trump last Nov and those that voted for Biden. Ita€™ s the largest such gap of the pandemic 
thus far. Right now, counties Trump carried by 10 or more points have over 2x higher case ratesa€!

David Reifschneider & David Wilcox: Another Reason to Raise the Feda€™ s Inflation Target: An 
Employment and Output Boom\ a€™ In 2012, the Federal Reserve formally adopted an inflation target 
and set it at 2 percent, in line with the level chosen by many other central banks. In hindsight, 
this setting left policymakers with too little room to cut interest rates when they want to fight 
recessions. Many researchers have noted that if central banks raised their
inflation targetsa€’’either individually or in concerta€”they could do a better job in the long run 
of keeping inflation near its target and the workforce fully employed. This Policy Brief highlights 
an additional and less-noted consequence of raising the inflation target modestly: The economy 
could enjoy a temporary but substantial boom in employment and output as it adjusted to the 
increase in the target. Model simulations suggest that if the target were lifted to

3 percent, the unemployment rate could average 3aD„4 percentage point or more below its sustainable 
level during the first 15 years after the higher target is announceda€!

Jeet Heer: Robert E. Lee Loses Again’. a€~Du Bois ends by making a crucial distinction between 
military valour and moral courage: a€oelt is the punishment of the South that its Robert Lees and 
Jefferson Davises will always be tall, handsome and well-born. That their courage will be physical 
and not moral. That their leadership will be weak compliance with public opinion and never costly 
and unswerving revolt for justice and right. It is ridiculous to seek to
excuse Robert Lee as the most formidable agency this nation ever raised to make 4 million human 
beings goods instead of men. Either he knew what slavery meant when he helped maim and murder 
thousands in its defense, or he did not. If he did not he was a fool. If he did, Robert Lee was a 
traitor and a rebela€%oa€“a€%onot indeed to his country, but to humanity and humanitya€™ s

Robert E. Lee Loses Again

Robert E. Lee, like many of his Confederate comrades, was better at fighting the war of reputation 
in the history books than the actual military contests of the battlefield. In defeat, Lee worked 
diligently to burnish his reputation. He thereby planted the seeds for the Lost Cause myth that

Derek Thompson: a€™ Quick thought on the remote work study, which got some people riled up. The
