The S&P Composite is down since the day before Elon Musk announced his desire to buy Twitter. Had 
Twitter tracked the S&P since that day before, it would now be selling at $31 a share. At closing 
on October 5, it was selling at $51.30; at closing on October 3, it was selling at $42.50. 
Comparing those prices to $31 and to the Musk promise of $54 a share,
I have seen many very bad things written about Twitter vs. Musk, but this struck mea€”and still 
strikes mea€”as the very worst:

J.B. Heaton and M. Todd Henderson: Twittera€™ s Lawsuit Against Elon Musk Looks Like a Loser: 
a€~The company probably cana€™ t prove damages, and its shareholders werena€™ t a party to the 
agreementaCI [so Musk] is likely to walk away largely unscathed.  This case will be a good lesson 
on the limits of boilerplate merger agreements and the difference between a corporation and its

shareholders....

Specific performance is used fleetinglya€! only when there is no alternative.... Delaware courts 
have rarely ordered specific performance in merger agreementsa€!. What happens if the court orders 
specific performance and Mr. Musk refuses?. It isna€™t Mr. Musk that promised to buy Twitter, but 
two entities under his control. The court could hold them in criminal contempt, buta€! 
aCcecorporations

have neither bodies to be punished, nor souls to be condemned.a€D Mr. Musk promised to a€cecausea€D 
these entities to consummate the deal, but a court is unlikely to jail him if he shirks or refuses. 
Mr. Musk could play a high-stakes game of chicken that ultimately reveals that courts are extremely 
limited in cases like this if the parties dona€™ t want to play along....

Damages.... Twitter shareholders are surely worse of.... But the shareholders arena€™t party to the 
agreement. Only Twitter Inc. is a partya€!. Twitter would have to prove harm, such as lost profits, 
and thata€™ s an uphill battlea€!. Thea€! $1 billion breakup fee.  Breakup fees are supposed to 
reflect damagesa€! [not] act as a penaltya€!. Twitter isna€™ t obviously worse off by $1 
billiona€”if at alla€”

a court might balk at imposing such a high fee...

Is there a sentence here that is on the same planet as the truth of the matter?
Of course, we have seen Todd Henderson before, talking nonsense:

It seemed to me then, and it seems to me now, that the University of Chicago Law School has a 
major, major quality control problem here. Perhaps someone should scrutinize its practices and 
procedures?
