<em><strong>Contra</strong></em><strong> Vince Reinhart: The Fed Has Done Very Well Indeed!</strong></h2><p>I disagree pretty strongly with the extremely smart Vince Reinhart here. He says that the past few years have revealed “cracks” in how the Federal Reserve makes monetary policy.</p><p>But I cannot see any cracks: to date, to me, monetary policy since the plague began has been well-nigh perfect. </p><p>Vince Reinhart thinks that the Fed moved “late” and moved “fast”, as if those are bad things. But in the situation it was optimal to be late, and good to then move fast. Indeed, if I had my druthers and had been running things, I would have moved later and then faster. The optimal monetary policy strategy coming out of the plague was to:</p><ol><li><p>delay raising interest rates until inflation was high enough to grease a rapid reopening recovery of and shift in economic activity into its new post-plague full-employment sectoral-balance configuration.</p></li><li><p>delay raising interest rates until there was full confidence that raising interest rates would not send the economy back to the secular-stagnation zero-lower-bound interest rate configuration.</p></li><li><p>then move rapidly to raise interest rates so that expectations of inflation did not become established and entrenched.</p></li><li><p>taking care not to overdue interest rate increases and so generate not a sfot landing but stagflation, quite possibly ending in a return to the secular-stagnation zero-lower-bound interest rate configuration.</p></li></ol><p>It looks to me like the Fed has succeeded 100% at (1)-(3). (4) still hangs in teh balance, but so far so good.</p><p>So what re the cracks? What is there to complain about?:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Vince Reinhart: </strong><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-2022-what-happens-next-11670867683">Why Inflation Took Off in 2022—and What Happens Next</a>: <em>The year was a stress test of the Fed’s new framework, and the cracks were apparent</em>: ‘The Fed only garners such attention making or correcting a major mistake—and there was a bit of both this year. Inflation was allowed to hit a 40-year high. Monetary policy had to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-raises-rates-by-0-75-percentage-point-largest-increase-since-1994-11655316170?mod=article_inline">pivot forcefully</a> to raise the target range for the overnight rate <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-raises-rate-by-0-5-percentage-point-signals-more-increases-likely-11671044561?mod=article_inline">to 4.25% to 4.5%</a> in 2022, including four 0.75-percentage-point installments. True, there were two outside, generational shocks—a global pandemic and a large-scale land war in Europe. However, those shocks were also a stress test of the Fed’s new monetary framework. This test revealed some significant cracks…. With inflation… at a 40-year high this spring, Mr. Powell and his Fed colleagues retired the word “transitory”…. The Fed… [brought] the overnight rate to a target range of 4.25% to 4.5% at Wednesday’s meeting…. The target range still implies a negative interest rate in real terms, even with an optimistic take on inflation expectations. A negative real interest rate won’t slow demand growth…. The challenge here is whether the Fed will be able to defeat inflation completely and regain the confidence of the markets. The jury is out...</p></blockquote><p>Vince is very smart, and very knowledgeable, but…</p><p>(1) The Fed has the confidence of the markets. As of Friday’s close, the markets are betting that from five to ten years in the future the CPI annual inflation rate will be 2.12%—and that is a PCE chain inflation rate of 1.6%-1.7%, below the Federal Reserve’s target:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F338501e7-1e94-4414-b135-14185643e89e_2298x704.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F338501e7-1e94-4414-b135-14185643e89e_2298x704.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F338501e7-1e94-4414-b135-14185643e89e_2298x704.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F338501e7-1e94-4414-b135-14185643e89e_2298x704.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F338501e7-1e94-4414-b135-14185643e89e_2298x704.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/338501e7-1e94-4414-b135-14185643e89e_2298x704.jpeg" width="1456" height="446" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/338501e7-1e94-4414-b135-14185643e89e_2298x704.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:446,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:144064,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F338501e7-1e94-4414-b135-14185643e89e_2298x704.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F338501e7-1e94-4414-b135-14185643e89e_2298x704.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F338501e7-1e94-4414-b135-14185643e89e_2298x704.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F338501e7-1e94-4414-b135-14185643e89e_2298x704.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The jury is not out.

But those sectors of the economy in which demand is sensitive to real interest rates—construction and, via the exchange rate, exports and import-competing products—are governed not by any real overnight rate but by the real longterm interest rate. The claim that “a negative real interest rate won’t slow demand growth” does not apply, because the relevant interest rate is not negative.</p><p>(3) In fact, the claim that “a negative real interest rate won’t slow demand growth” does not make any sense: a shift from a more negative to a less negative real interest rate would slow demand growth.

If we were on a podcast… keeping things moving, my pushback… would be… there’s a fine line between… the Quaker wisdom of silence and Aaron Burr’s “talk less, smile more, don’t let them know what you’re against or what you’re for” advice from Hamilton…. The world suffers when too many of the most level-headed people simply opt out of certain conversations for the sake of avoiding contentiousness. So while Ezra sees too many hotheads and attention-sucks, I see too many Ezra Kleins staying silent, creating a “best lack all conviction, worst are full of passionate intensity” dynamic.

Facebook became an all-conquering corporate behemoth, and Twitter managed to stay profitable and secure from competition in spite of being <a href="https://twitter.com/AvidHalaby/status/1602127460677844993">notoriously poorly managed</a>. But almost immediately after the great centralization of the 2010s, I started noticing that something was wrong with the internet I had come to know and love…. <em>Community moderation works</em>. This was the overwhelming lesson of the early internet. It works because it mirrors the social interaction of real life…. From Twitter, however, there seemed to be no exit…. And the people who ran Twitter on the corporate side had no intention of changing this at all.… What they really wanted was to keep making money. They tinkered at the edges of the platform, but never touched their killer feature, the quote-tweet, which <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/how-the-retweet-ruined-the-internet">Twitter’s head of product called “the dunk mechanism.”</a> Because dunks were the business model — if you don’t believe me, you can check out <a href="https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1594384754534670337">the many research papers showing</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1567153031120052227">toxicity and outrage</a> drive Twitter engagement…</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Kinda scary obvious true things like this are up for debate:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Alan Wm. Wolff, Robert Z. Lawrence, &amp; Gary Clyde Hufbauer</strong>: <a href="https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/pb22-17.pdf">Have Trade Agreements Been Bad for America?</a>: ‘A false narrative has gone mainstream in America. It claims that trade agreements the United States entered into over the last 40 years, perhaps for nearly a century, were a mistake. There is no nuance to this narrative.… Relatively open markets bring international competition, and in all competitions some players come out ahead and some behind; in extreme cases, the losers suffer serious harm…. We do not think that 13 American presidents, from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama, got it wrong…. The trade agreements that the United States entered into were strongly positive for America and that policy approaches taken need to be built on rather than abandoned…</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>This is just plain weird: When you become President of the United States, you take an oath that you will faithfully execute the laws. One of the laws is that presidential papers go to the National Archives (and then to your Presidential Library) in order to preserve the historical record. As near as I can see, Clive Crook is not saying that Trump should not be imprisoned but just fined for violating the Presidential Records Act: he is saying that whether people obey the Presidential Records Act should be up to them, with no sanctions for violations whatsoever. It is not like Trump did not know that the letters and papers were not his. There is an argument for not prosecuting people who accidently and unintentionally violate records-preservation laws. But that is not what we have here, is it?:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Clive Crook: </strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-08-11/was-the-fbi-search-of-trump-s-mar-a-lago-in-the-public-interest?srnd=opinion">Would Locking Up Trump Serve the Public Interest?</a>: ‘You might well ask: How can investigation and prosecution of crimes ever fail to be in the public interest? Very easily. A conscientious effort to prosecute every crime to the fullest extent of the law might leave surprisingly few Americans at liberty. This country has built such a vast constellation of criminal offenses that prosecutorial discretion — that is, choosing not to prosecute — is not so much a function of limited resources as something that justice actually requires. According to reports, the crimes Trump possibly committed might include such heinous acts as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/us/politics/trump-classified-records-timeline.html">keeping</a> a letter former President Barack Obama left for him in the Oval Office… </p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Sounds like this was fun:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Matt Dinan: </strong><a href="https://mattdinan.substack.com/p/the-single-book-course">The Single Book Course</a>: ‘My own little act of protest in coming back to teaching after the pandemic and sabbatical was thus to teach a course on a single book: Plato’s <em>Republic</em>…. The single book course is good because of its simplicity. There is no real question of competing priorities: we are going to read Plato’s <em>Republic</em> and then get together and talk about it…. It was an unmixed pleasure to watch my students attracted and repelled—sometimes from one moment to the next—by Socrates’ communism, his vision of equality according to nature, his scheme for philosophical rulers, and the outrages required to bring it about. The imposition of complete form—with its mirror image in the formlessness of tyranny—cannot be justice. Why do we want it?
