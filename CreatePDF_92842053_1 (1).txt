Roll the Dice, Kevin! (2023-01-05)

If I were Kevin McCarthy, I would make a motion to elect the Speaker by a plurality, and see what 
happens...

Right Now A34e House Is a Zombie (2023-01-04)

Right now the House can only do three things:

1. Collect nominations for Speaker

2. Vote on a Speaker

3. Adjourn until a date and time certain

ita€™ s a strange form of Constitutional Groundhog Day.

Furthermore, at the moment there are no Representatives. There are only Representatives-Elect, who 
will not become Representatives until they are sworn in, after the election of a Speaker.

Parliamentary Procedure (2023-01-04)

Were I Kevin McCarthy this morning, I would wind up some of my guys and tell the Handmaiden Caucus 
that, for each one of them who does not vote for me, one of my guys will vote a€oepresenta€oe. 
Thus, if more than eight handmade caucus members do not vote for McCarthy, Hakeem Jeffries becomes 
Speaker. ^^(The Republicans will then be able, when they do have their ducks in a row, to vote to 
vacate the chair next week.

Noah Smith writes: The "monetary policy hasn't had time to work yet, therefore inflation is falling 
all on its own and the Fed is needlessly endangering the economy" line is not credible.

I reply: That argument is for a tighter gearing from short-term rates to spending-relevant rates. 
The five-year TIPS did not begin to move until mid-December 2021: 6 mos to affect demand and then 6 
mos more to affect inflation anda€! we will start to see its effects this montha€!

Distributional & Monetary Models of Inflation (2023-01-03)

There is an interesting debate between David 
Glasnerhttps://uneasvmonev.com/2023/01/01/vou-sav-potato-i-sav-potahto-vou-sav-tomato-i-sav-tomahto-
vou-sav-distribution-i-sav-expectation/ and Olivier Blanchard

Olivier Blanchard @ojblanchardl

1/8. A point which is often lost in discussions of inflation and central bank policy. Inflation is 
fundamentally the outcome of the distributional conflict, between firms, workers, and taxpayers. It 
stops only when the various players are forced to accept the outcome.

going on.

I think the easiest way to conceptualize what I think of as the major point is to set up a model in 
which:

• The central bank has a target rate of inflation.

• The rate of inflation is a constant markdown applied to the rate of nominal wage increase.

•  The rate of increase of nominal wages that workers are able to demand, and enforce, is a 
declining function of the unemployment rate and of the real wage.

In this model, there is a warranted rate of nominal wage increase: the central banka€™ s inflation 
target, plus the wedge between price inflation and nominal wage increase. In this model, the 
natural rate of unemployment is the rate at which the actual rate of nominal wage increase is equal 
to the warranted rate, and thus depends on the level of the real wagea€”with a lower real wage 
sustainable only with a higher natural rate of unemployment.
You can understand this as a distributional conflict: total demands for production greater than 
100% of supply, and so attaining a feasible equilibrium requires one of:

1. diminishing other groupsa€™ claims on income and so pushing real wages up enough that nominal 
wage increases demanded are at the nominal warranted rate of wage increase.

2. raising the unemployment rate enough that nominal wage increases demanded are at the nominal 
warranted rate of wage increase.

3. accepting an inflation rate higher than the central banka€™ s target, and thus achieving 
feasibility via the exploitation of workersa€™ short-run money illusion.
If                                                                            you take this 
approach, I think it becomes clear that Blanchard and Glasner are talking past each other, and are 
not really disagreeinga€!

My Rapidly Mounting Intellectual-Attention Debt (2023-01-02)

It is only 12 hours into 2023, and already I have read (well, in the case of the first noteda€”I 
read it last fall) four things that I really want to re-read again, carefully, and think for a long 
time about:

• Olivier Blanchard: Fiscal Policy under Low Interest Ratesi^A 
<https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262544870/fiscal-policy-under-low-interest-rates/>

•  Nick Confessore: The Invention of Elise Stefanik: I^UTo rise through the Trump-era G.O.P., a 
young congresswoman gave up her friends, her mentors and her ideals. Will it be enough?... <https

<https://noahpinion.substack.eom/p/the-third-magic>
RAUdi Dornbusch used to say to us graduate students: They pay me to write the literature, not read 
the literature.

I still do not know whether or not I should be saddened by this, because if I just read the 
literature, and do nothing else, I am of no use...
