Campanella writes of how his age: “has in it more history within 100 years than all the world had in 4,000 years before! of the wonderful inventions of printing and guns, and the use of the magnet…” The effect is somewhat marred by the immediately following “…and how it all comes of Mercury, Mars, the Moon, and the Scorpion!”, See Francis Bacon and Tomasso Campanella, New Atlantis and City of the Sun: Two Classic Utopias, New York: Dover Publications, 2018, p. 85 &lt;http://books.google.com/?id=rLljDwAAQBAJ&gt;</p><p>11) Keynes, “Consequences”, pp. 9. He very much hoped—if post-WWI reconstruction was successful and humanity could be gotten back onto its pre-WWI track—that that confinement of enjoyment would not be permanent, for before World War I “society [had been] working not for the small pleasures of today but for the future security and improvement of the race—in fact for 'progress'. If… the cake were not cut but was allowed to grow in the geometrical proportion… of compound interest, perhaps a day might come when there would at last be enough to go round… when posterity could enter into the enjoyment of our labours… overwork, overcrowding, and underfeeding would come to an end, and men, secure of the comforts and necessities of the body, could proceed to the nobler exercises of their faculties…”, p. 12</p><div><hr></div><p>12) Aristotle, Politics, Ernest Barker, trans., Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 14, Bekker sections 1253b-1254a.

One can—perhaps should—and even must agree with Camus and see “Sisyphus happy”. As <strong>Ken Untener</strong>&nbsp;wrote in a a speech for&nbsp;<strong>John Dearden</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>It helps, now and then, to step back and take a long view.... We cannot do everything, and there is a sense of liberation in realizing that. This enables us to do something, and to do it very well.... We are workers, not master builders; ministers, not messiahs.... </p><p>We are prophets of a future not our own...</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/incomplete-draft-long-notes-to-conclusion?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/incomplete-draft-long-notes-to-conclusion?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/incomplete-draft-long-notes-to-conclusion/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/incomplete-draft-long-notes-to-conclusion/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p></p><p></p><p></p>
