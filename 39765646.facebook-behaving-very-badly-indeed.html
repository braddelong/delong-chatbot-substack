We have to stop screwing around, realize that we might soon face an unprecedented surge in children’s hospital COVID19 admissions. Also we’re seeing lots of RSV even RSV-Covid co-infections. We’re in crisis mode and must do the following now: 1) mask mandates for schools, 2) vaccine mandates for schools, 12 and up, and 3) EUA for vaccines for school aged kids, 5–11. That’s the reality if you want school…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1424110629967876096&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;1/3 Many thanks Jim ⁦<span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@Acosta</span>⁩ for hosting me today, explaining a dire situation unfolding across the South and one we’ve not seen before: Large numbers of young people, including adolescents and kids being hospitalized and even pediatric ICUs (PICUs) filling up… &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;PeterHotez&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Prof Peter Hotez MD PhD&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sat Aug 07 20:50:07 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/E8N1EaXXEAQfuwo.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/iKESPId0bm&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:1345,&quot;like_count&quot;:3755,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1424110629967876096" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/PeterHotez.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @PeterHotez" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">Prof Peter Hotez MD PhD </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@PeterHotez</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">1/3 Many thanks Jim ⁦<span class="tweet-fake-link">@Acosta</span>⁩ for hosting me today, explaining a dire situation unfolding across the South and one we’ve not seen before: Large numbers of young people, including adolescents and kids being hospitalized and even pediatric ICUs (PICUs) filling up… </div><div class="tweet-photos-container one"><div class="tweet-photo-wrapper "><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.substack.com%2Fmedia%2FE8N1EaXXEAQfuwo.jpg"><img class="tweet-photo" src="https://pbs.substack.com/media/E8N1EaXXEAQfuwo.jpg" alt="Image" loading="lazy"></picture></div></div></a><a class="tweet-link-bottom" href="https://twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1424110629967876096" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><span class="tweet-date">8:50 PM ∙ Aug 7, 2021</span><hr><div class="tweet-ufi"><span href="https://twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1424110629967876096/likes" class="likes"><span class="like-count">3,755</span>Likes</span><span href="https://twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1424110629967876096/retweets" class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">1,345</span>Retweets</span></div></div></a></div><div><hr></div><p><strong>Jacob T. Levy</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Who’s Afraid of Judith Shklar?</em>: ‘Meet the American philosopher who showed that Western politics could only move forward by first taking a step backward…. “The Liberalism of Fear”… is fundamentally an essay about the boundaries of liberalism. Over the course of the mid- to late 20th century, liberalism became encumbered by considerable cultural baggage…. Shklar tries to recenter liberalism by insisting it is essentially a political… doctrine… freedom, but the substance of freedom is to be determined by the individuals seeking it for themselves…. She thought the philosophical and juridical liberalism of rights and justice associated with Immanuel Kant and Rawls, as well as the aspirational liberalism of self-development found in John Stuart Mill’s work, ultimately went astray because it distracted from the most urgent political task associated with freedom: restraining state violence…. Shklar treated people’s experience of injustice as worthy of moral consideration on its own….. Shklar’s was a liberalism motivated not by a summum bonum, an ultimate good, but by a summum malum, an ultimate evil, something to be avoided: namely, cruelty and the fear it inspires. Liberalism’s emphasis on restraint, she argued, should be motivated by the distinctive political evil of living in fear of state violence and cruelty…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/16/whos-afraid-of-judith-shklar-liberalism/">https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/16/whos-afraid-of-judith-shklar-liberalism/</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Ed Zitron</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Hybrid Office Is Anti-Worker—&amp; a Failure of Management</em>: ‘Companies such as Zillow and Salesforce… level the playing field…. Instead of having in-office employees gather in a conference room while remote employees dial in, if one person is not in the physical room, everyone will dial in separately on their laptop, regardless of whether they’re in the office. And just like that, there’s an immediate solution to “leaving people out” of meetings…. Hybrid work… is a stopgap between a reframing of what an office actually is, and an attempt to hold back the future of work, which will be primarily remote for those who can do their work at the computer. It’s a frenzied attempt by executives and managers to keep some form of control other than “paying and treating people well enough to keep them working for you,” with bizarre attempts to recreate after-work drinks and social events that nobody at work really needed…. We are at a point where people are actively coming up with reasons not to go remote, and hybrid work is simply their way of instituting a compromise, with the (potentially) intended consequence of alienating those who don’t come into the office…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:39703778,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://ez.substack.com/p/the-hybrid-office-is-anti-worker&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:null,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Ed Zitron's Where's Your Ed At&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/97017fa1-b263-4616-902f-774b57da05f1_256x256.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Hybrid Office Is Anti-Worker - And A Failure of Management&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;The New York Times published yet another challenge-free “remote workers will get left behind in hybrid work” piece, where the author-backed by the usual stack of McKinsey and Stanford brain masters - hammers home that those who are going to be in the office will be the victors of the hybrid debate.
