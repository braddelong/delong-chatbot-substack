But high unemployment directly reflects only a small proportion of the population. Inflation, even moderate inflation, affects everybody: everybody sees the economy, as having broken its social compact with them. Everybody finds themselves unable to purchase at the prices they had expected, and had thought reasonable. Everybody is consequently annoyed. When politics stands on the knife-edge of catastrophe—as it does now—near-universal annoyance is more of a danger than is justified anger against the system on the part of relatively few.</p><p>John Maynard Keynes put his finger on the problem back in 1919, in his <em>The Economic Consequences of the Peace:</em></p><blockquote><p>Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth…. Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose… &lt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15776/15776-h/15776-h.htm&gt;</p></blockquote><p>The prose is overly purple. And Keynes was thinking of high and variable inflation, in which:</p><blockquote><p>The currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery…</p></blockquote><p>But it does apply to even the moderate inflation we are currently undergoing, and even if this inflation turns out to be transitory. A perceived-by-everyone breaking of the social compact is a weighty thing. Getting inflation “under control” ought to be a very high priority.</p><p>Let me reset. Compare the situation today to what people feared two years ago would be the case today. How are we doing? The answer is: we are doing very well indeed. Jay Powell and his Federal Reserve (and Joe Biden and his administration) ought to be taking victory laps.</p><p>Let me ask ask uyou to back up a little more than a decade. Two and a half years after the start of the Global Financial Crisis in 2007, the U.S. unemployment rate was kissing 10%, the Federal Reserve had found that it had no traction to speed recovery, and the Obama administration had just thrown away its ability to use fiscal policy to speed recovery by promising to veto spending and tax bills that were insufficiently austere. It would, after that moment in late 2009, take six years for the U.S. economy to approach full employment. The cumulative pointless and unnecessary economic losses of $7 trillion from deficient employment alone, plus a multiple from investments not made, business models not experimented with, and workers not trained during the decade of ænemic recovery. Take that multiple, and add on the shadow cast on the economy after 2015 by the anemic recovery. Guess that multiple to be three.</p><p>The key thing to hold on to is this: this time, we have avoided all of that.</p><p>Relative to the Bernanke Fed, therefore, the Powell Fed are public benefactors to the residents of the United States to the tune of $21 trillion dollars. We could afford to make each of the 19 voting and alternate members of the Powell FOMC as rich as Elon Musk was at his peak, and that would only eat up 1/10 of the good they have done relative to the Fed, Congress, and President of a decade ago.</p><p>But we do now have an inflation problem. </p><p>So after it finishes taking its victory laps, and after the cheers the Powell Fed deserves—but that somehow I am not hearing right now?—die down, what should the Powell Fed do to deal with the current inflation problem?</p><p>A standard economist would start to think abou this question by asking themself: What does macroeconomic theory tell us?</p><p>Unfortunately, macroeconomic theory tells us nothing. Macroeconomic theory is a historical analogy dressed up in a leotard, a tutu, and pointe shoes. I do admit that there are a very few macroeconomists—Paul Krugman comes to mind—who are able to successfully use macroeconomic theories as intuition pumps. But for the rest of us macroeconomic theories are nothing but boxes into which we can file historical analogies, or perhaps a better analogy would be that they are distilled and crystalized versions of memories of historical events—distilled and crystalized versions adulterated with ideology, and you better hope the adulterant is simply oregano,</p><p>So what historical analogies are there?</p><p>The U.S. has faced five—or maybe six, depending on whether you count the 1970s as one or two episodes—inflation problems in the past century and a bit. One, the WWII inflation brought under control by wartime price controls, is not relevant to our situation. That leaves four (or maybe five) historical parallels.</p><p>(1) The first is the WWI-era inflation, brought under control when the newly-installed Fed raised its discount rate from 3.75% to 7%, and triggered a short but very deep recession accompanied by substantial deflation. Milton Friedman judged that the Fed had moved too late—should have started raising interest rates a year or more before it did—but moved too far when it did move.</p><p>(2) The second is the post-WWII inflation. Inflation peaked at 16.7% on a trailing annual basis in May of 1947 as the U.S. economy reoriented itself from its wartime to its post-war structural configuration. The Federal Reserve did nothing. It was focused on propping up the value of all the U.S. Treasury bonds that had been issued to fight World War II. Inflation then declined over the next two years to 8%, and then went negative in 1949, when a minor recession came.</p><p>(3) The third is the 1951 inflation. Inflation peaked at 8.6% on a trailing annual basis in May 1951 as the U.S. geared up to fight the Korean War and, perhaps more important, to build up the full Cold War military prepared to instantly project power anywhere on the globe. Again, the Fed did nothing. And the inflation wave passed. By May 1952 it was below 2%. And recession was avoided until a minor one in late 1953.</p><p>In both 1947 and 1951, we found ourselves wheeling the structure of our economy in a different directionÅ—demobilization from World War II and the firing-up of the civilian economy in 1947, remobilization for the Cold War in 1951—with remarkable speed. There needed to be some wage inflation: cutting nominal wages in contracting industries, is devastating for worker, morale, and thus businesses do not do it; in order to have market signals poll, workers into expanding industries, the wages in those industries have to rise—hence some wage inflation. There needed to be some bottleneck-driven cost inflation: it is the rise in prices around bottlenecks that the market needs to incentivize firms to correct them by economizing on the scarce and adding to supply. That is how the market undertakes the Hayekian price-discovery and subsequent activity-reorientation process. The natural rate of inflation—the rate of inflation that allows the economy to reach not just full-employment equilibrium but the best full-employment equilibrium—is elevated whenever we need to wheel the structure of the economy into a new configuration.</p><p>By how much is it elevated? We do not know. We do not have good models here.</p><p>Is this a problem? It should not be. A good central bank works to build credibility precisely so that it has enormous freedom of action to follow the policies in the short run that are best for the economy, even if that means it does not hit its long-run inflation target in the short run. And the Federal Reserve has spent generations building credibility, so it ought to have considerable short-run freedom of action to allow for higher inflation now without creating expectations of a prolonged inflationary spiral.</p><p>(4) The fourth, or the fourth and fifth, are the 1965-1984 experience, when inflation rose from 2% at the start of 1966 to 4.4% on Richard Nixon's inauguration in January 1969, reached a trough of 2.8% in August 1972, roared to 10.9% in November 1974 with the Oil Crisis, declined to 4.5% in December 1976, and then came roaring back to a peak of 12.8% in March 1980. The Federal Reserve wished and washed. Arthur Burns, Fed Chair from 1970 to 1978, was too interested in having a strong economy while his friend and patron Richard Nixon ran for reelection in 1972, and did not believe that Congress would let him keep interest rates high enough for long enough to cure inflation by monetary policy. G. William Miller, Fed Chair over 1978-9, was out of his depth. And Paul Volcker raised interest rates to a peak of 16.9% in December of 1980, and did not lower them below 10% until August of 1982.</p><p>The problem in that 1970s was that an expectation that wage inflation next year would be about what wage inflation had been this year, perhaps a percentage point per year or so more, also got embedded in the economy. But that embedding came with no countervailing information flow in terms of price discovery about the true real costs of energy intensive activities. We already knew what OPEC had done, and what its consequences were going to be.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The thing that gives us hope that the second and third episodes, 1947 and 1951, are relevant is that long-term inflation expectations implicit in the bond market are still trading at their normal "in the long run bet that inflation will be about 2.5% range". One thing to fear is that this is like 1920—that the inflation rate would have passed on its own, but the Federal Reserve is in the process of tightening too much right now. The second thing to fear is that this is indeed like the 1970s, and that the important thing is to scotch any expectations of an inflationary spiral before they are even formed.</p><p></p><p>Back in the 1970s we knew what the structural-adjustment problem was. The two triplings of oil prices, in 1973 and 1979, meant that everything energy intensive had the relative price structure strongly tilted against it. There was not a great deal of price discovery to be done: simply take the energy intensity of an activity and multiply it by nine, and you get with the new equilibrium real price of it was going to be.</p><p></p><p></p><p>John Cassidy: Over the weekend, I published a piece taking a closer look at Larry Summers’ argument that Biden’s American Rescue Plan was largely to blame for the inflation surge and the Fed botched its response…. Much of the piece revolves around whether demand (stimulus/Fed) or supply (pandemic) is primarily driving inflation….</p><p>Brad DeLong: ’I am not sure that the supply/demand division framing makes a lot of sense. Inflation is the result of a supply/demand mismatch. This mismatch could be transient and healthy—a side effect of the good things of rapidly rejoining highway traffic at speed and wheeling the economy toward a more goods- and deliverator-heavy configuration. This mismatch could be long-lasting and unhealthy. The question is which. And the answer to that question turns on whether the economy has lost its expectational inflation anchor: Do people still expect inflation to be about 2%? Or do people think inflation is up-for-grabs and recent past inflation (or recent past plus a little more) is your best guess for what inflation will be in the future?

We still are way short of full employment. Some of that is due to childcare and virus-fear bottlenecks. But some of it isn’t. And to the extent that there are important jobs not being done because people can’t afford to make alternative childcare arrangements or fear the virus—well, the inflation that comes from paying people more to see if they will take those jobs is to be welcomed, not fought:</p><p>Plus the economy has undergone a great wheel: 6% less relative to trend in personal consumption expenditures on services, and 20% more relative to trend in personal consumption expenditures on goods. Not all of that is going to stick into the post-plague economy, but a good deal of it will. We have an economy in which nominal wages and some nominal prices are really sticky downward. That means that if market prices are to do their job signals of where the value is, prices and wages in industries that need to expand must rise relative to prices and wages in industries that need the contract. With prices and wages in industries that need to contract sticky downward, that means: inflation:</p><p>Now it is certainly true that we do not want the inflation now, which we want, and which is an essential part of a rapid restoration of general prosperity, to stick around once we arrive at whatever our new normal is going to be. But I look outside my window now, and I see no new normal.</p><p>Thus my immediate second response is to ask the question: Why is it not obvious to nearly everybody questions of inflation control should be postponed until their proper date—which will be when the plague has fallen to an endemic flu-like illness, and when the economy is back to full employment?</p><p>Perhaps I should not be surprised at our world of public discourse about finance and economics that does not seem to have thought much, if at all, about the relationship between macroeconomics and rapid structural change. This is, after all, the same world of public discourse about finance and economics that never managed to absorb Paul Krugman's very important 1998 point call if you find yourself at the zero lower bound on interest rates, that means that your inflation target is too low: &lt;https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1998b_bpea_krugman_dominquez_rogoff.pdf&gt;</p><p>====</p><p>First: Six Episodes of U.S. Inflation Above 5%/Year in the 1900s</p><p>The top graph is the CPI inflation rate; the bottom graphs are overlapping graphs of the Federal Reserve’s discount rate—the rate at which it lends to banks on reasonable collateral.</p><p>Counting 1974 and 1979 as two episodes, there were six times in the twentieth century during which the annual inflation rate got above 5%. One was the World War II inflation—cut off by price controls. Then came the post-WWII structural-rebalancing-and-pent up demand inflation, and then the Korean War structural-rebalancing inflation as the U.S. government wheeled its economy to fight the Cold War. During both the Fed sat by—it was then still focused on keeping the prices of Treasury bonds high. The inflations soon passed away.</p><p>Before those came the World War I episode. That episode of inflation was cut off by an increase in the discount rate from 3.75%/year to 7%/year, which not only ended the inflation but enforced deflation: a 20% decline in the price level from its peak. (This decline, I should ask, made the task of restoring the gold standard at anything like pre-World War I nominal parities much more difficult, hence much more pointless.) Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz judged that the rise was “not only too late but also too much” &lt;https://archive.org/details/monetaryhistoryo0000frie/page/230/&gt;: the Fed should have moved earlier to prevent excessive bank discounts from inappropriately boosting high-powered money, and at the moment the Fed did move the structure of credit was sufficiently based on a continuation of Fed policy that the Fed’s move generated “one of the most rapid declines [in economic activity] on record”.</p><p>If the Federal Reserve had not moved to raise discount rates after World War I, what would have happened? Friedman and Schwartz’s judgment is that an earlier increase of, say, 125 basis points to remove the incentive for banks to engage in excessive discounts would have brought the excessive growth of the high-powered money stock to an end, and stopped the inflation.</p><p>Then came the 1970s: The Fed raised interest rates after the Yom Kippur War oil shock to control inflation; then, after inflation peaked, it lowered them to try to restore full employment; then came the year when, as the late Charlie Schultze said, “our forecasts of nominal income growth were dead on, but inflation came in 2%-points high and real growth 2%-points low”; and then came the Volcker disinflation, reversed in September 1982 when they realized that they had bankrupted Mexico, and not resumed as the Fed decided to declare a fall in inflation to the 4-5%/year range as complete victory. That 4-5% target lasted for a decade, followed by the opportunistic disinflation down to and Alan Greenspan’s declaration of the 2%/year inflation target—a declaration that it is very hard today to argue was appropriate, given the extraordinary amount of time global north economies have spent with interest rates at their zero lower bound since.</p><p>What does macroeconomic theory tell us that the Federal Reserve should do now, in the spring of 2022?</p><p>Olivier Blanchard writes:</p><p>In early 1975, core inflation was running at 12 percent and the real policy rate was equal to about −6 percent, a gap of about 17 percent. Today, core inflation is running at 6 percent and the real policy rate is equal to −6 percent, a gap of 12 percent—smaller than in 1975, but still strikingly large…. It then took 8 years, from 1975 to 1983, to reduce inflation to 4 percent, with an increase in the real rate from bottom to peak of close to 1,300 basis points, and a peak increase in the unemployment rate of 600 basis points from the early 1970s. Today is obviously different in many ways…. [But even so,] it reasonable to think that a 200-basis-point increase in the policy rate, so only 1/6 of the rate increase from 1975 to 1981, will do the job this time when the gap between core inflation and the policy rate is 2/3 of what it was in 1975? And that unemployment will barely budge? I wish I could believe it… &lt;https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/why-i-worry-about-inflation-interest-rates-and-unemployment&gt;</p><p>The suggestion seems to be that we have today 2/3 of the problem we had in 1975, and so the solution would be to do 2/3 as much—to raise interest rates by 800 basis points, 8% points—but then to apply some haircut to that 800 basis-point interest-rate rise because “today is obviously different in many ways”.</p><p>But why does he pick 1975-1983, rather than 1951 or 1948 or 1920? Does economic theory tell him to do so?</p><p>Truth be told, there is no economic theory. There is only history, and its events, and analogies we make based on judgments concerning complicated emergent processes we do not understand very well that come out of the millions of interactions that are the economy. Sometimes, it is true, we distill and crystallize the history into something we call theory where little squiggles that look like ɣ, δ, β, σ, and so on; we then mainline the crystallized product. After mainlining it we can think we know something. But after mainlining crystal meth we experience increased energy, elevated mood, extraordinary confidence, racing thoughts, muscle twitches, and rapid breathing, among other things.</p><p>Move cautiously. Be data-dependent. Wait for it to become clearer which, if any, historical analogies are relevant to our situation. And always, always, always remember that in an economy that is near and that we have a good reason to fear will long remain in danger of hitting the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, premature and excessively aggressive moves that raise interest rates cannot easily be corrected.</p><p>S</p><p>====</p><p>This is, to put it bluntly, exactly right.

But the current uptick in price growth is highly likely to be a largely benign consequence of the post-pandemic recovery.</p><p>BERKELEY – In the past three years, technological advances have provided about one percentage point of warranted US real wage growth each year – admittedly, only half the rate of earlier times, but still something. Yet, real wages are currently 4% below their warranted value from adding on the underlying fundamental productivity trend to the pre-pandemic real wage Employment Cost Index (ECI) level. Does that sound like a “high-pressure” labor market to you?</p><p>Those who believe that the US labor market is in some sense “tight” point out that the ECI increased by 3.7% in the year to September – well above its 3% annual growth rate in the pre-pandemic years of former US President Donald Trump’s administration. But, because US consumer prices have increased by 5.4% over the past year, the ECI-basis real wage has fallen by 1.7% in that period. In a high-pressure economy with a tight labor market, workers would have enough bargaining power to obtain real wage increases.</p><p>Nowcasting is extremely difficult, and hazardous. But the “now” that I see today is the one I forecasted two to three quarters ago. Yes, the recovering US economy, like a driver who suddenly accelerates, is leaving inflationary skid marks on the asphalt. But, as I argued in May, these should not concern us, because “burning rubber to rejoin highway traffic is not the same thing as overheating the engine.”</p><p>The US is not currently in a situation where too much money is chasing too few goods, which would result in a surfeit of demand for labor and likely trigger an inflationary spiral. This is despite the fact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its associated disruptions continue to cause a substantial undersupply of labor.</p><p>Today, the US economy’s overall employment-to-population ratio is three percentage points below what we used to regard as its full-employment level. The ratios for women, African-Americans, and workers without a college degree are, respectively, five, 4.5, and four percentage points below this level.</p><p>Yet, economists whom I respect talk as if the economy is in serious inflationary trouble. Jason Furman, a former chairman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, thinks “the original sin was an oversized American Rescue Plan,” the $1.9 trillion recovery package that President Joe Biden signed into law in March. In Furman’s view, it would have been better to have less aggressive policy measures and thus a slower employment and growth recovery this year, because Biden’s plan “contributed to higher output but also higher prices.” And according to the same New York Times report, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers thinks that “inflation now risks spiraling out of control.”</p><p>The inflation worriers then argue that the COVID-19 crisis has permanently damaged the supply side of the economy by causing a lot of early retirements, as well as lasting disruption to the lean-and-mean supply chains on which a good deal of productivity and prosperity had depended. Perhaps. But similar arguments in the early 2010s, in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, aimed to justify policies that did not put the pedal to the metal and attempt rapidly to re-employ so-called “zero-marginal-product” workers. One consequence of this timidity was the election of Trump, whose rise was fueled by the rage of those who thought “elites” cared more about immigrants and minorities than they did about blue-collar workers whose economic opportunities had never recovered to pre-2008 levels.</p><p>Lastly, some claim that, regardless of whether or not the labor market is tight, inflation – whether driven by supply-side or demand-side factors – is high and salient enough that firms and households will swiftly incorporate it into their expectations. Thus, the inflationary snake has to be scotched now, while it is small, before it grows and devours everything of value.</p><p>But so far, rising inflation has not been incorporated into any of the “sticky” prices in the economy, according to the measure constructed by the Atlanta Federal Reserve. True, the financial market’s current 30-year breakeven inflation rate, at 2.35%, is more than half a percentage point above where it settled in the second half of the 2010s. But today’s rate is similar to that in the first half of the decade, and slightly below the level that would be consistent with the US Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2% per year.</p><p>The current uptick in US inflation is highly likely to be simply rubber on the road, resulting from the post-pandemic recovery. There is no sign that inflation expectations have become de-anchored. The labor market is still weak enough that workers are unable to demand substantial increases in real wages. Financial markets are blasé about the possibility of rising inflation. And a substantial fiscal contraction is already in train.</p><p>Given these facts, why would anybody argue that the “original sin” was the “oversized American Rescue Plan,” and that tightening monetary policy starting right now is the proper way to expiate it?

Maybe there is an argument that we need to fear not bond-market vigilantes, but rather other actors and agents. Maybe it is their expectations of inflation have become substantially de-anchored already. Maybe they are already taking steps that will produce a persistent inertial inflationary spiral.</p><p>But who are they?</p><p>What are their expectations?</p><p>How are their expectations now being translated into actions?</p><p>And how are those actions not easily reversible?</p><p>I have not seen any of those arguments made.</p><p>Blanchard writes, apropos of the 200 basis-point increase in the Federal Funds rate we expect to see over the next two years:</p><p>Is it reasonable to think that a 200-basis-point increase in the policy rate, so only 1/6 of the rate increase from 1975 to 1981, will do the job this time when the gap between core inflation and the policy rate is 2/3 of what it was in 1975? And that unemployment will barely budge? I wish I could believe it…</p><p>But why is the rate increase from 1975-1981 relevant? We have a target: inflation from five to ten years out. We have an instrument: the current level and planned forward path for the Fed Funds rate. We have a reading on whether we are on a glide path to the target—the bond market’s 5-year, 5-year forward expected inflation rate. That reading says we are.</p><p>Is there a better reading available as to whether we are on the glide path?</p><p>If so, what is it?</p><p>I believe that there is not. So why is the conclusion not: “Policy is appropriate. The Fed is not behind the curve”? This is, to me, a very genuine mystery.</p><p>Blanchard writes:</p><p>There are good reasons, however, to think that the Phillips curve will, as it has done many times in the past, shift, and that the landing will be harder than Reifschneider and Wilcox conclude. Part of the inflation will indeed go away on its own, but the Fed may have to increase interest rates by more than 200 basis points to get back to its target…</p><p>Indeed. The Fed may have to raise interest rates by more than 200 basis points. The Phillips Curve may well shift. And when there is evidence that the Fed is indeed behind the curve and not on an appropriate glide path, it will be time for the Fed to use forward guidance that it has changed its policy plans to shape expectations.</p><p>But why is today that day?</p><p>Especially since errors in not raising interest rates quickly enough are errors from which we can recover, but at and near the zero lower bound—which we are—errors in raising rates too quickly are errors from which we cannot reasonably recover.</p><p>====</p><p>FIRST: Optimal Control &amp; the Optimistic Inflation Forecasts from the Bond Market</p><p>Optimal control. You have an objective: to get inflation back into its target range over the medium term—five to ten years from now—and to do so while doing the least damage to other objectives like employment and growth. If your best forecast is that your current policy path gets you there, you maintain your currency policy path. If your best forecast is that your current policy path does not get you there, you take the cheapest and most effective step to move the future needle. If the bond-market 5-year 5-year forward inflation breakeven is not the best forecast, what is the best forecast? Indeed, given that inflation is an expectational phenomenon in all our standard models—inflation will be what it is expected to be plus policy-change and economic-shock terms—it is very hard to see how the bond-market 5-year 5-year forward inflation breakeven could not be the best forecast. And if our standard models are not the best models, what are the best models?</p><p>Thus I look at this, and I think those who claim inflation is “out of control” are doing their audiences and their selves no good service…</p><p>Me over at Project Syndicate:</p><p>With commentators offering increasingly dismal warnings about the inflation situation in the United States, one might think that the US Federal Reserve has failed completely at its primary task. But the bond market is telling a different story, and there is no reason to think that it is driven by doves.</p><p>BERKELEY – As of Friday, May 6, the bond market expected US consumer price inflation to average 2.5% between five and ten years from now. That is the rate of inflation needed to equalize returns on inflation-indexed and non-indexed US Treasury securities. And given that CPI inflation has been running higher than the rate associated with the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures, I count that 2.5% five-year, five-year-forward rate as hitting the US Federal Reserve’s 2% price-deflator inflation target.</p><p>What, then, would it take to get the economy back to the Fed’s targeted inflation rate? Since the five-year breakeven rate at the close of May 6 was 3.22%, the implicit expectation is that inflation will run a cumulative total of 3.6 percentage points above the Fed’s target over the next five years. If it does not cause the economy’s inflation anchor to vanish, a deviation of that size would be an exceedingly small price to pay for the rapid recovery from the pandemic-induced recession. If the recovery delivers the structural economic transformation that we need, the higher inflation that we have experienced will have been well worth it.</p><p>Accordingly, it seems to me that the Fed should be taking a victory lap. It has done precisely what it is supposed to do, by enabling America’s sticky-price, sticky-wage, sticky-debt economy to return rapidly not just to full employment but to the right version of full employment – the one that has workers working in sectors making products for which there is real, fundamental demand – after a shock. And it has done so without disrupting confidence in the monetary system and its stability.</p><p>So why does the very sharp Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University argue that “things are way out of control”? If you have been diverted from your desired trajectory, and you then find yourself on a path where you can expect to return to it, I would think the only way to describe the situation is as a case of being “in control.”</p><p>Rogoff makes clear that there is “a lot of uncertainty,” and that he is “not going to say I know exactly what needs to be done.” But his observation that inflation is “way out of control” makes sense only to the extent that he is willing to declare the bond market and its implicit expectations to be wrong. Only then could the expected evolution of Fed policy lead to inflation significantly higher than 3.22% over the next five years, and to average inflation significantly above 2.5% 5-10 years hence.</p><p>Sure, that could happen. The economy is a surprising place, and our models and forecasts are ultimately just poorly informed guesses. The Fed might have to change course substantially. It might have to send the US economy into a substantial recession with significantly higher-than-expected interest rates to return inflation to its target over the five- to ten-year medium run.</p><p>For Rogoff’s own implied forecast to come to pass, workers and bosses would have to reach wage bargains that assume inflation well above 3.2% for the next five years and well above 2.5% for the five years after that. Moreover, those inflationary wage bargains would have to be locked in place through contracts and institutional arrangements that would make it hard to revise them downward should they turn out to have exaggerated actual inflation. For workers and bosses to do that, they would have to be pretty confident that bond traders are irrationally Panglossian – that they are inflation doves despite the evidence to the contrary.</p><p>Is there any reason to think that bond traders are irrational Panglossian inflation doves? Are there any reasons to think that workers and bosses now believe that bond traders are irrational Panglossian inflation doves?</p><p>I see none.</p><p>In our modern economy, an outbreak of inflation is a peculiar expectations-driven process. It requires a vicious circle in which expectations of high inflation drive actions that then validate those expectations – with higher wages leading to higher consumer prices that in turn lead to demands for higher wages, ad infinitum. For this to happen, the expectation of high inflation has to come from somewhere, and as of now, it is not in evidence.</p><p>Yes, additional adverse supply shocks could lie in our future. The COVID-19 virus still has the potential to mutate and confront us with dangerous, disruptive new strains. Further disruptions could emanate from a widening of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine or from an economically catastrophic interaction of new virus variants and China’s zero-COVID policy. These kinds of developments could push inflation out of control.</p><p>But the fact that such risks exist does not mean we should live as if they have already come to pass, and thus ignore the world as it currently is.</p><p>LINK: &lt;https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/bond-market-medium-term-inflation-currently-on-target-by-j-bradford-delong-2022-05&gt;</p><p>====</p><p>Brad DeLong: Why the US Federal Reserve’s Options Are Limited: The US Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee ought to announce a rate increase that is large enough to bring its policy rate to an optimal neutral-plus level. But it has an even greater interest in adhering to its own forward guidance, implying that it will probably maintain its incremental approach.</p><p>BERKELEY – What policy will the US Federal Reserve announce after the Federal Open Market Committee’s two-day meeting this week, and what policy should it announce?</p><p>The first question is easy: There is a high probability – 75% – that the Fed will follow its previous forward guidance and raise its target for the short-term safe nominal interest rates that it controls by 50 basis points, from 0.75–1% to 1.25–1.5%. By validating its previous statements, the Fed hopes to steer the economy in the desired direction by shaping expectations of future interest rates.</p><p>Because this “jawboning” strategy is effective only insofar as the Fed’s forward guidance is trusted, building and maintaining that trust is a major policy objective in itself. The Fed should deviate from previous forward guidance only if there is substantial evidence that the economy is on the wrong track. Currently there is no such evidence. Bond-market expectations of the underlying long-run consumer price index inflation trend remain under 2.5% per year – which is lower than in the pre–2014 period, when no rational person had any reason to fear that CPI inflation would soon deviate upward from its target.</p><p>To be sure, the bond market expects the annual CPI inflation rate to be around 3% over the next five years, before falling to its longer-run 2.5% annual trend. Wouldn’t that higher rate justify additional steps to tighten monetary policy more than was previously expected? No, because the Fed does not merely want to hit its inflation target on a year-by-year basis. Rather, its primary task is to maintain confidence in the economy’s nominal price-level anchor over time. As long as it is doing that, it has the short-run policy freedom to do whatever else is needed to maximize employment and growth.</p><p>By contrast, if the Fed were to deviate from its own forward guidance by raising interest rates faster than previously planned, it would reduce confidence in its word, and reduce employment and growth in the construction, export, and import-competing sectors. A 0.75 percentage-point increase carries palpable costs for little gain, implying that there is little chance that the Fed will go this far.</p><p>The question of what the Fed should do is more difficult. Bond-market expectations (after accounting for duration-risk premiums) suggest that the federal funds rate will average about 2.75% per year over the next two years, before falling to 2.5% per year over the next decade. In other words, markets expect the Fed to raise its policy rate to 3.5% over the next year, and then move on to a glide path back down to perhaps 2% – or until something else happens to the macroeconomy. This trajectory implies three 50-bps interest-rate increases and four 25-bps increases over the next seven meetings.</p><p>The least preferable path is for the Fed to dribble out interest-rate increases in a manner that leaves people uncertain about how far it thinks it ultimately will need to go. The far better option would be to move immediately to a neutral plus-or-minus federal funds rate – choosing “plus” if demand seems too high for the Fed to maintain the credibility of the nominal inflation anchor in the long run, and “minus” if it thinks that demand is unsustainably low. Optimal control theory dictates that if the nose of your sailboat is not pointing where you want to go – if your control is not at the optimal level – you should turn the nose as fast as possible until you reach a bearing where you can no longer tell whether your next course correction will need to be to the port or to the starboard.</p><p>What this means for monetary policy is that the Fed should change its target each month so that people do not know whether the next move will be up or down. Yes, there is an argument that this principle of optimal control theory does not apply to monetary policy: the Fed needs to avoid disruptions in the money market. But such disruptions are feared precisely because the Fed never makes larger moves.</p><p>Moreover, the Fed must conduct monetary policy with the tools and procedures that it has. If it raises its policy rate by only 0–25 bps this week, even though it wants the federal funds rate to be considerably higher, it will have departed from its forward guidance. There is no argument for doing that. But it has not prepared the ground for a rate hike larger than 50 bps. That is unfortunate. Ideally, the ground would have been prepared for an increase as high as 200 bps, because that is what it would take to get the federal funds rate to an optimal neutral-plus level. But, because that hasn’t happened, and because departing from forward guidance is almost never worth it, there is a 75% chance that the Fed will increase its policy rate by 50 bps at its coming meeting – and a 25% chance that it will go as high as 75 bps.</p><p>====</p><p>FIRST: No. The Federal Reserve Did Not '‘Drink the Kool-Aid’ in 2021:</p><p>Let me enthusiastically endorse the second half of this from Olivier Blanchard.</p><p>It seems to me to be completely right: The way to bet for the medium- and long-run is that we are still in a régime of secular stagnation. The demand for safe assets continues to be extremely high, because so much wealth is being held and will continue to be held by actors that are not pursuing a portfolio strategy of maximizing their real risk-adjusted expected return. (And do remember that Steve Cohen and I noted this emerging trend and tried to grapple with understanding what it was going to mean back in… it was 2010: The End of Influence: What Happens When Other Countries Have the Money &lt;https://www.amazon.com/End-Influence-Happens-Other-Countries/dp/0465018769/&gt;.) As long as the demand for assets that are “safe” in the sense that their nominal values track one of the global reserve currencies is so high relative to supply as to be constantly pushing their values up to par, things are going to be really weird:</p><p>But that consideration seems to me to make the first half of what he says wrong. Indeed, I do not understand what argument could lead somebody to believe it:</p><p>Olivier Blanchard: Economists Exchange: ‘I didn’t anticipate the role of the goods market, which is that in many sectors the strong demand led to supply disruptions and very large increases in prices. In the end, inflation came first not from where I would have expected it to come, which was wages, but rather from prices…. I think that the increase in prices, the disruptions in supply chains, are very much the result of strong demand hitting supply walls. So, I would claim that I should get a few points for being right in February or March of 2021. Anybody could have come to the same conclusion. I’m happy I did…. What should the Fed have done or said when the fiscal package was passed? I hope that Jay Powell picked up his phone and told the administration that this was going to be an issue. His staff drank the Kool-Aid, and he, not being a professional economist, could not easily second-guess them. They thought inflation expectations would remain anchored and that the Phillips curve was flat….</p><p>The question is, indeed, how much of this is a blip. I use the word bump, which I think has a slightly longer length than a blip. But I believe we will then go back to low real interest rates. So, on this, I’m going to do the Larry Summers thing. I am going to say, with probability 0.9, we’ll return to something like that world. I think there’s a tendency for markets to focus on the current, on the present and extrapolate it forever. But if I look at the factors behind the decline in real interest rates since the mid–1980s, none of them seems about to turn around, except perhaps one, which is investment…</p><p>LINK: &lt;https://www.ft.com/content/e63dab63-bf41-4c43-b827-1b1736fc518d&gt;</p><p>The point that in a régime of secular stagnation the loss function is asymmetric is decisive.</p><p>The Federal Reserve can deal with an overheated economy by raising interest rates, sharply—sharply!—decreasing demand for construction investment, for exports, and for domestic production of import-competing goods, and so freeing-up productive capacity to satisfy the other components of domestic demand, thus removing inflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve cannot—cannot!—deal with a frozen economy at its zero nominal lower bound on interest rates. Forward guidance is simply not effective at the required scale: modern central banks have inordinate difficulty in credibly committing to be “irresponsible” and inflationary in the future. Quantitative easing is the closest thing to powerless that a monetary-management tool can be. Therefore monetary policy needs to focus, unless doing so has the most dire consequences, at avoiding situations in which nominal interest rates hit the zero nominal lower bound. And there was a definite, palpable risk in early 2021 that the economy without the early 2021 fiscal package was going to stay at the zero nominal lower bound.</p><p>Indeed. Blanchard says that he expected “inflation [to] c[o]me first… from… wages”—an overheated labor market giving workers the power to bargain for substantial real wage increases, which would then force businesses to raise their prices to try to recoup some of the costs. But that is not what happened: instead, under the pressure of plague waves, supply chains broke and bottlenecks emerged. Prices of bottlenecked goods spiked, and so the world economy turned its attention to the now-crowdsourced problem of figuring out how to get rid of those bottlenecks and expand productive capacity.</p><p>Price increases that focus crowdsourced attention on places in the economy where there are constraining bottlenecks is usually seen as a good thing for a market economy to have: it is how we become richer. Would it be a better world if we had not had that focus of attention on relieving bottlenecks, and so expanding productive capacity? I really do not think so.</p><p>After all, in any reasonable societal well-being function, short-run inflation has significant costs only if it destroys the long-run inflation anchor. And it has not done so. So when Blanchard says that Powell’s “staff drank the Kool-Aid… thought inflation expectations would remain anchored…” and so a failure to raise interest rates substantially was a policy mistake, I say: “Huh?!”</p><p>Not passing the early 2021 fiscal package, or having the Federal Reserve immediately respond by raising interest rates a year ago, would have slowed down the recovery: a serious loss. And it would have produced nothing more than an infinitesimal gain—as long as the long-run inflation anchor remains. Which it does. Long-term inflation expectations have remained anchored:. Should they breakout above 2.5%, I will be calling on the Federal Reserve to do more, and do it faster. But they are still on track, still where they should be:</p><p>====</p><p>WE HAVE a very nice reframing of the current mindset of the Federal Reserve by the extremely smart Robert Armstrong and Ethan Wu of the Financial Times:</p><p>The Federal Reserve currently anticipates that their medium-run inflation target can be restored with an increase in interest rates of only 250 basis points over the next three years.</p><p>The first thing to say is that—if the Federal Reserve is correct—that low a level of interest rates at their peak means that we will once again hit the zero lower bound on interest rates if and win another negative demand shock hits the economy. That means, above all, that the long-run inflation target is too low to maintain macroeconomic balance. The Federal Reserve should already have thought about this and take an action to raise the inflation target.</p><p>The second thing to say is that the overwhelming bulk of the inflation we are right now seeing must be transitory if such a small increase in interest rates will be sufficient to return the economy to its 2 1/2% per year long-run inflation target. This is, as I say over and over again, not a 1970s like inflationary spiral—not melting the engine—but rather leaving rubber on the road as you rejoin the highway traffic at speed. Rejoining the highway traffic at speed is a good thing to do. Leaving rubber on the road is a necessary consequence of doing that. It’s stupid to complain about it.</p><p>The third thing to say is that restoring an economy to full employment while undertaking a massive structural shift in an economy with sticky downward wages (and some prices) has always, in our experience, been accompanied by a transitory burst of inflation. You have to incentivize movement into the sectors that need to expand by creating price differentials vis-a-vis the contracting sectors. And with their wages (and some of their prices) downward-sticky, that is a transitory burst of inflation. It is the post World War II demobilization and the Korean war era mobilization from the Cold War that should serve as are examples, if indeed there are any examples that are relevant. Those who look at the US post-Korean War experience and try to generalize from that are, I think, barking up the wrong tree:</p><p>Robert Armstrong &amp; Ethan Wu: The Fed Still Thinks Inflation Is Transitory: ‘The most surprising thing in the Fed’s sedate December meeting was the news… that monetary policy committee members project three interest rate increases next year, rather than the two that consensus had called for. Even this spooked no one…. The Fed is acknowledging short rates will need to rise somewhat to hedge against persistent inflation. That is evident in the 2022 and 2023 dots. But the median forecast for rates in 2024 nudged up only a bit, from 1.75 percent to just over 2 percent. The longer-run dots have stayed the same…. The committee thinks, with a high level of unanimity, that a short raising cycle, topping out at 2.5 percent, will ensure that inflation is transitory…. Above target inflation will last about a year. Everybody, say it together now: transitory! The Fed retired the word, but it still thinks the same way…. The bond market wholeheartedly agrees with the Fed’s attitude…</p><p>LINK: &lt;https://www.ft.com/content/024e4598-61cf-4871-89dc-0626d71a8c96&gt;</p><p>====</p><p>Inﬂation worries</p><p>Joshua K. Hausman ∗ University of Michigan</p><p>September 2, 2022</p><p>The price level in the U.S. today (July 2022) is 8.5 percent above its level in July 2021 and 15.5 percent above its level in July 2019. 1 How worried should we be about inﬂation persisting? Until recently, the answer from ﬁnancial markets and the Federal Reserve was clear: very little. In the words of Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, the Fed and ﬁnancial markets believed in “immaculate disinﬂation.” 2 Disinﬂation would be immaculate, since it was expected to neither involve large increases in interest rates nor a signiﬁcant increase in unemployment. 3 More recently, the Fed has moved away from its prediction of immaculate disinﬂation, at least in its rhetoric. 4 At the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole conference on 26 August, for instance, Jay Powell noted that the labor market is “clearly out of balance” and that reducing inﬂation will “bring some pain” (Powell, 2022). As I write this on September 2nd, the extent to which the Fed’s rhetorical shift will be accompanied by a change in its quantitative forecasts and / or its actions is unclear. The Fed has yet to convince ﬁnancial markets that its rhetorical shift will translate into signiﬁcantly tighter policy.5 </p><p>I shall argue the task ahead of the Fed is a diﬃcult one, more diﬃcult than the Fed’s recent hawkish rhetoric acknowledges. I start by arguing that inﬂation is likely to remain high in</p><p>Ford School of Public Policy and Department of Economics, University of Michigan. 735 S. State St. #3309, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.

These forecasts are similar to those made by Federal Reserve board members and Federal Reserve bank presidents in June 2022. The median forecast in the June Summary of Economic Projections was for an unemployment rate of 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4.1 percent in in the fourth quarter of 2024. The median forecast was for headline and core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inﬂation (Q4 to Q4) equal to 2.6 and 2.7 percent in 2023 and 2.2 and 2.3 percent in 2024. Markets and the Fed also agreed that interest rates would not need to rise much. On 10 August 2022, the two-year government bond yield was 3.2 percent (FRED series DGS2) slightly below the Fed’s June Survey of Economic Projections which had a median forecast for the federal funds rate of 3.4 percent at the end of 2022, 3.8 percent at the end of 2023, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2024.</p><p>4 For more on the Fed’s shift away from faith in immaculate disinﬂation, see Chodorow-Reich, Twitter, 8/30/22.</p><p>5 Jay Powell’s Jackson Hole speech led to only a small increase in the yield on two-year government bonds: two-year government bonds yielded 3.35 percent on 8/25, the day before Powell’s speech, 3.37 percent on 8/26, and 3.42 percent on 8/29 (FRED series DGS2).</p><p>1 the short-run. High inﬂation in the short-run will then collide with political obstacles to tight monetary policy. As a result, I suspect that there is a good chance that neither the Fed nor the Federal government more broadly will be willing to implement the contractionary policy necessary to return inﬂation to low levels (2 to 3 percent). The U.S. may thus face a prolonged period of high inﬂation akin to that in the 1970s. I hope I am wrong, since high inﬂation would almost certainly have unfortunate economic and political consequences.</p><p>1 The Short-Run</p><p>Over the three months from April to July 2022, the core consumer price index (CPI) rose at annualized rate of 6.8 percent. 6 From June to July, core CPI inﬂation slowed to an annualized rate of 3.8 percent, but it is unclear how much to make of this one month reading. 7 Rent increases, supply-side, and demand-side factors all point to inﬂation remaining high.</p><p>Start with rents. One-third of the CPI is shelter. Most of this is “owners-equivalent rent,” what the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) guesses one would pay in rent for a house that one owns. 8 The BLS measures what households on average pay in rent, not the rent one would pay if one signed a new rental contract today. Thus the shelter component of the CPI lags changes in rents charged in new contracts. If the goal is to measure the cost of living, the BLS method is roughly correct. 9 Changes in rents in new contracts only aﬀect Americans’ cost of living as existing rental contracts are renegotiated. In any case, this way of measurement means that one can expect the shelter component of the CPI to contribute perhaps a percentage point to CPI inﬂation through 2023. 10 The eﬀect is large because rents in new contracts have risen rapidly since early 2020; data from Zillow and Apartment List show rents on new contracts up about 25 percent since February 2020. 11 By contrast, the shelter component of the CPI rose</p><p>6 FRED series CPILFESL. The core CPI is the CPI excluding food and energy. Food and energy prices are volatile and often unrelated to macroeconomic conditions. Thus excluding them provides a better indicator of underlying inﬂation, of what inﬂation is likely to be in the future.</p><p>7 In July, core PCE inﬂation also fell (FRED series PCEPILFE). But reasons for caution in concluding that the July data was a signal of a durable decline in core CPI inﬂation to below four percent include that both trimmed mean and median inﬂation were higher than core CPI inﬂation. See Jason Furman, Twitter, 8/10/22.</p><p>8 See CPI Weights.</p><p>9 It is only roughly correct, because the BLS uses rental data from month t − 6 through month t to calculate the shelter component of the CPI in month t. For more on BLS measurement of shelter, see BLS shelter.</p><p>10 Lansing, Oliveira, and Shapiro (2023) argued in February 2022 that “Our panel model predicts that future rent inﬂation could increase by about 3.4 percentage points (pp) in both 2022 and 2023 relative to the prepandemic ﬁve-year average. This prediction translates into an additional 1.1pp increase in overall CPI inﬂation for both 2022 and 2023” (p. 1). See also Bolhuis, Cramer, and Summers (2022).</p><p>11 See the ﬁgure from Jason Furman, Twitter, 8/13/22.</p><p>2 only 9 percent over this period. 12 The shelter component of the CPI will catch up to new rents as rental contracts roll over. Thus the large expected eﬀect on CPI inﬂation going forward.</p><p>Rents alone would not be an an insurmountable barrier to achieving low (say 3 percent) inﬂation in the short-run. But both supply and demand factors add to the challenge. Two of the most obvious supply shocks are high natural gas prices resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the computer chip shortage. The computer chip shortage is reﬂected in the fact that the U.S. produced 12 percent fewer cars and light trucks in the ﬁrst seven months of 2022 than it did in the ﬁrst seven months of 2019.13 </p><p>Covid itself is also an ongoing supply shock pushing up inﬂation. Hundreds of thousands of infections a day mean many workers missing work, limiting the supply of goods and services. Long covid cases have shrunk (and will continue to shrink) the labor force. 14 Covid-mitigation eﬀorts also constrain supply. Childcare centers may limit hours and thus limit hours worked by parents because of measures to keep children and staﬀ in pods. Covid-protocols (e.g. sanitizing surfaces, plexiglass barriers) may reduce productivity in some service industries. And Covid border restrictions (e.g. the closure of China) may make producing goods abroad more diﬃcult.15 </p><p>Predicting future supply shocks, positive or negative, is impossible. But I see little reason for supply to be a reason for optimism about inﬂation. Both rosy and bleak scenarios are plausible. On balance, the existing supply shocks are likely to diminish, but new ones may occur. The war in Ukraine might end, lowering energy prices. And there are glimmers of hope that the computer chip shortage will become less acute. 16 But economic disruption from Covid could increase rather than decrease. And a lesson from the past two years is that new, unexpected, supply shocks can easily occur. Candidates include natural disasters (e.g. a hurricane in the U.S. disrupting Gulf of Mexico energy production), and the end of China’s zero covid policy. Economic recovery in China could lead to a large increase in global commodity</p><p>12 FRED series CUSR0000SAH1.</p><p>13 FRED series MVAAUTLTTN. For more on the impact of the chip shortage on the auto industry, see JP Morgan.</p><p>14 See Brookings.</p><p>15 In December 2021, I wrote about the relationship between covid and inﬂation at more length in The Atlantic. Relative to my views then, I now think that Covid is playing less of a role in driving inﬂation, with high aggregate demand playing a larger role.</p><p>16 See JP Morgan.</p><p>3 prices. 17 Inﬂation itself may also induce supply shocks, as inﬂation lowers real wages leading to worker strikes.</p><p>Unfortunately, supply shocks are colliding with an overheated economy. Indeed what are reported as indicators of supply shocks may instead be indicators of high demand. Widely reported congestion at U.S. ports, for instance, might be better seen as an eﬀect of high demand rather than as a shock to supply. Real goods imports in 2021 were 8 percent above their 2019 level. Ports were congested because more imports were passing through them.18 </p><p>Indeed, indicators of high demand are everywhere. Most obviously, the labor market is extraordinarily tight, with the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent. 19 The ratio of job openings to the number of unemployed implies that the labor market is even tighter than the unemployment rate suggests (Domash and Summers, 2022). Given ﬁrms’ diﬃculty hiring, it is unsurprising that over the 12 months from June 2021-June 2022, private sector wages and salaries rose 5.7 percent. This was the most rapid 12-month increase since 1982. 20 In the decade from the end of 2009 through 2019, annual private sector wage and salary growth averaged 2.3 percent. Thus returning to pre-Covid inﬂation rates is likely to require a signiﬁcant decrease in nominal wage growth. This matches the conclusion of Jason Furman, who argues that the employment cost data are consistent with a 4 percent inﬂation rate. 21 Unfortunately, as Domash and Summers (2022) convincingly argue, both theory and empirical evidence suggest that nominal wage growth is unlikely to decrease without a substantial weakening of the labor market and a recession.</p><p>Continued shortages of goods and services ranging from childcare to new cars reﬂect a combination of high demand and constricted supply. It is diﬃcult to ﬁnd childcare because childcare centers are struggling to hire the workers they need. 22 It is diﬃcult to buy a new car because car computer chips are in short supply. Shortages are evidence of high demand relative to supply, but they may also forecast future inﬂation. Firms are unlikely to persistently fail</p><p>17 On the eﬀect of demand in China on commodity prices, see Matthew Klein, Financial Times, 8/16/22. 18 NIPA table 1.1.6. Using data on port volumes, Jason Furman has also made this point about port congestion being an indicator of high demand. See Furman, Twitter, 10/15/21. The inﬂuence of demand on port congestion, of course, does not rule out some additional role for supply factors.</p><p>19 This is the unemployment rate in August 2022 (FRED series UNRATE) 20 Employment cost index, series ID CIU2020000000000I and ECU20002I.</p><p>21 Furman, Twitter, 7/29/22. Jason Furman argues that the more recent average hourly earnings data are also consistent with 4 percent inﬂation (Furman, Twitter, 9/2/2022).</p><p>22 See, e.g., U.S. News &amp; World Report.</p><p>4 to meet demand without raising prices. A car manufacturer that cannot provide its customers with the car they want at the existing price will eventually raise that price. Some empirical evidence supports this view. Lamont (1997) ﬁnds that in the 1970s, newspaper mentions of shortages forecast inﬂation.</p><p>2 The Policy Response</p><p>Inﬂation’s persistence beyond 2023 will depend both on luck—unforeseen shocks to supply and demand—and policy. My guess is that there a good chance, call it 50 percent, that both monetary and ﬁscal policy are expansionary enough that inﬂation remains above three percent for several years. In this prediction, I ﬁnd myself out of step with the Fed, ﬁnancial markets, and many economists.</p><p>Jay Powell and other FOMC members have said clearly that they will take whatever actions are necessary to lower inﬂation. At the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole conference, Jay Powell concluded his speech by saying: “We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply, and to keep inﬂation expectations anchored. We will keep at it until we are conﬁdent the job is done” (Powell, 2022). Financial markets and professional forecasters believe these statements. Thus long-run inﬂation expectations from professional forecasters and from ﬁnancial markets are near two percent. In the August 2022 Survey of Professional Forecasters, forecasters expect inﬂation over the next decade to average 2.8 percent (CPI) or 2.45 percent (PCE). 23 On 1 September 2022, expected inﬂation over the next ten years from inﬂation-linked bonds (TIPS) was 2.45 percent. 24 Given higher expected inﬂation in the near term, these forecasts imply that inﬂation will be even lower in the long run. The TIPS forecast for 5-year inﬂation, 5 years ahead is 2.38 percent.25 </p><p>I do not share the conﬁdence of professional forecasters and markets. Let me suggest three reasons for doubt. First, the 1970s provide reason to doubt that professional forecasters are good at forecasting inﬂation when the economy switches from a low to a high inﬂation regime. During the entire decade of the 1970s, actual inﬂation in every year was the same or higher than that forecast in the Survey of Professional Forecasters (DeLong (1997), p. 266-267). The 1970s look more consistent with high actual inﬂation leading to high expected inﬂation, rather</p><p>23 See SPF.</p><p>24 FRED series T10YIE. 25 FRED series T5YIFR.</p><p>5 than low expected inﬂation leading to low actual inﬂation.</p><p>A second reason for doubt is that the Fed’s actions thus far do not inspire conﬁdence. July was the 14th consecutive month in which 12-month core CPI inﬂation was above 4 percent and the 10th consecutive month in which core PCE inﬂation was above 4 percent. 26 Yet over this time, the Fed has done relatively little to tighten policy. It increased the nominal federal funds rate by 2.25 percentage points, from a range of 0-0.25 percent to a range of 2.25-2.5 percent. The increase in the real interest rate was less, however, since inﬂation expectations rose. 27 Consistent with the view that the Fed did little to tighten policy, the unemployment rate fell 1.5 percentage points between August 2021 and August 2022.28 </p><p>The 1970s are often taken as an example of a decade in which the Fed responded insuﬃciently to inﬂation. But the Fed responded far more in the 1970s than it did in 2021-22. Figure 1 compares the path of 12-month core CPI inﬂation and the Federal Funds rate around three dates when core inﬂation rose above four percent: January 1968, October 1973, and June 2021. For comparison, the ﬁgure also shows the path of core inﬂation and the federal funds rate around August 1979, when Paul Volcker become Fed chair. 2021 stands out relative to the 1970s for both the low level of nominal rates relative to inﬂation and for the small change in nominal rates after the increase in inﬂation. That the current Fed has done so little in comparison to its actions in 1968 and 1973-74 or to Paul Volcker’s actions in 1979 may cast doubt on whether the Fed today will follow through on its hawkish rhetoric.</p><p>Such doubts are increased by the fact that the Fed will almost certainly soon face strong political pressure to stop tightening. Indeed, such pressure has already begun. Senator Elizabeth Warren told Jay Powell at a hearing on June 22, 2022:</p><p>[T]he reason I’m so concerned about this is rate increases make it more likely that companies will ﬁre people and slash hours to shrink wage costs. Rate increases also make it more expensive for families to do things like borrow money for a house and so far this year, the cost of a mortgage has already doubled.</p><p>26 FRED series CPILFENS and PCEPILFE.</p><p>27 Expected inﬂation over the next year from the Michigan Survey of Consumers increased from 4.7 percent in July 2021 to 5.2 percent in July 2022 (FRED series MICH).

Otherwise, you could make things a lot worse.</p><p>And right now, the Fed has no control over the main drivers of rising prices, but the Fed can slow demand by getting a lot of people ﬁred and making families poorer. And while President Biden is working to increase energy supplies and straighten out supply chain kinks and break up the monopolies and bring down prices, you could actually tip this economy into a recession.</p><p>So, I just want to say, you know what’s worse than high inﬂation and low unemployment? It’s high inﬂation and a recession with millions of people out of work. And I hope you’ll reconsider that before you drive this economy oﬀ a cliﬀ.29 </p><p>I quote this at length, since it captures the sort of criticism that the Fed will almost certainly receive more of in the near future. Suppose it is a year from now, August 2023, and inﬂation is ﬁve or six percent, the unemployment rate ﬁve percent and rising, mortgage rates are seven percent, and housing and stock prices down ﬁve to ten percent. In this plausible situation, the Fed will face enormous pressure to lower interest rates. That the Biden administration currently supports the Fed’s tightening eﬀorts tells one little about what political support will look like when or if the unemployment rate is high and rising and when or if Fed actions look likely to endanger the Democrats’ chance of holding the White House in 2024.</p><p>More broadly, the current U.S. political environment may be inconsistent with low inﬂation. High inﬂation in the 1970s ended because Jimmy Carter was willing to risk his political career to end it; appointing Paul Volcker as Fed chair led both to the end of the Great Inﬂation and contributed to Carter losing the 1980 election. It is unclear that either the Republicans or Democrats would be willing to make such a political sacriﬁce today. 30 If winning elections is (perhaps correctly) regarded as existentially important, then committing to tight monetary policy will be diﬃcult.</p><p>Of particular concern is the Republican party and speciﬁcally Donald Trump’s willingness to</p><p>29 Senataor Warren Press Release, 6/22/22.</p><p>30 How much Jimmy Carter understood of what Paul Volcker would do to the economy and his election chances is unclear (DeLong (2022), p. 440). But regardless of whether the appointment of Paul Volcker was a deliberate eﬀort to tighten policy, his appointment came amidst an environment of administration support for tighter monetary policy (DeLong (1997), p. 274). For the more on the current politics of Fed tightening, see Timiraos, WSJ, 8/26/22.</p><p>8 pressure the Fed for looser policy. Any unconditional forecast of inﬂation must put substantial weight on the path of inﬂation in a second Trump administration. (On 29 August 2022, the online betting market PredictIt had Trump with a 24 percent chance of winning the 2024 election.) Against a background of an unemployment rate below 4 percent and a recent cut in the Federal Funds rate, Donald Trump tweeted on 23 August 2019 “My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powel [sic] or Chairman Xi.” 31 This was one of numerous tweets from Donald Trump criticizing the Fed. Given the volume of criticism in 2019, when unemployment was historically low, it is likely that a second Trump administration would strongly oppose tight Fed policy. The Fed does have substantial independence, of course, but this independence is not written in the constitution; a congressional majority has complete control over the Fed. Thus the Fed’s ability to resist strong political pressure is limited.</p><p>My doubts about future Fed policy are likely to meet with skepticism from economists. I suspect there is more agreement with my prediction that a substantial ﬁscal contraction is unlikely. Unknowns suggest betting on larger rather than smaller future deﬁcits. Inﬂation itself may lead to more expansionary ﬁscal policy, as voters demand tax cuts and / or transfer payments to oﬀset higher prices. And while the debate surrounding what became the Inﬂation Reduction Act suggests that the Democratic party is unlikely to entirely ignore budget deﬁcits in making policy, it hard to ﬁnd evidence that a Republican administration would have any similar concern about the deﬁcit. The worry is that budget deﬁcits will both raise aggregate demand directly through Keynesian mechanisms and constrain monetary policy. Monetary policy could be constrained, since high real interest rates would make ﬁnancing U.S. government debt expensive. The U.S. government in 1980 had little debt, so in this respect controlling inﬂation now could be more diﬃcult than it was for Volcker.32 </p><p>3 Conclusion</p><p>I have made the case for pessimism about U.S. inﬂation. In the short-run, the feeding through of new rents to existing renters, and supply and demand factors will likely keep inﬂation high. In the longer-run, there is a substantial probability that political pressure will prevent</p><p>31 See screenshot here: CNBC.</p><p>32 See Hanno Lustig, Twitter, 4/2/22. A further diﬃculty is that relative to 1980, much more of U.S. debt is now held abroad; thus high real interest rates would mean large real payments to foreign bondholders. This could cause political diﬃculties.

A year with a ten percent inﬂation rate is much better than a year with a ten percent unemployment rate. The higher inﬂation becomes, however, the larger a recession will need to be in order to lower inﬂation. Thus the costs of unemployment become costs of inﬂation. Inﬂation can also have unfortunate political eﬀects. Voters hate inﬂation, and high inﬂation would contribute to dysfunctional U.S. politics.</p><p>I would like to be wrong in my worries about inﬂation.

Bradford DeLong, the UC Berkeley economist, former Clinton White House official, and old-school member of the economic blogosphere (dating all the way back to the late 1990s.)</p><p>Forget about the “long 19th century,” DeLong argues. That’s the theory made famous by Eric Hobsbawm, who The New Yorker profiled in 2019 as “the communist who explained history.” The pivotal period in world history occurred from the American and French Revolutions of the late 1700s to the first World War in 1914, Hobsbawm argued. </p><p>To hear DeLong tell it, Hobsbawm just didn’t live long enough to see himself proven wrong, as DeLong’s “long 20th century” from 1870 to 2010 was a period of unsurpassed economic growth. The problem, DeLong says, is that’s been over now for more than a decade and the global economy might never recapture its momentum. Humans got closer to utopia than ever before, but we’ve been slouching toward it for too long.</p><p>He sat down with Fortune ahead of his book’s release to talk about whether the economy’s best days are behind us, or if we are doomed to live in a dystopia full of killer robots flying through the air, scorching summer temperatures wrought by climate change, and, to paraphrase Allen Ginsberg (DeLong loves economic paraphrases, as the title of his book indicates), the best technical minds of the world turned to selling ads by figuring out how to scare people. </p><p>But he says he still believes that the United States is the “furnace where the future is being forged.”</p><p>The following interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Congratulations on your book and thank you for taking the time after walking your dog.</p><p>Yes, we got two dogs during the plague year. It’s very good to have the daily exercise of dog-walking: It’s an effective way of gaining and outsourcing additional willpower.</p><p>I’ve been a reader of yours for a long time, and you have always had this unique style among economic writers. </p><p>I personally really love this book, because I have long been a big fan of Eric Hobsbawm and his concept of the “long 19th century.” When did you first read him?</p><p>I first came across Hobsbawm when [former Harvard economics professor] David Landes made me read them back when I was an undergraduate, around 1980 or so. Landes would say, “I don’t really recommend left-wing students read Hobsbawm, because he’s too convincing, but you’re enough of a right winger that it will annoy you, but also teach you and you’re really the kind of person who ought to read this.” </p><p>Well, thinking about the long 19th century, you have democracy and industry starting off together in the middle of the 1700s, and then the globalized industrial revolution with steam, the industrial economy changing to coal and oil, and empire. That then takes you up to 1914 and the catastrophe that starts there. The arc of those three books is, I think, quite wonderful and extremely successful. Especially the first two. </p><p>Your “long 20th century” runs from 1870 to 2010, when the world had a burst of economic progress that you say is now over, thus proving Hobsbawm wrong. So is it really over?</p><p>In 1870, the last institutions fall into place to produce technology that doubles every generation, thus enabling Schumpeterian creative destruction in which the next generation is twice as rich, but also a huge chunk of industries, occupations and patterns of life vanish in order to make that happen, and that makes a lot of people angry. Whatever running code of societal organization you crafted, the forces of production as they existed at any moment after 1870, those no longer work 30 or 40 years later, and you have to build new and different patterns and institutions on the fly. And that’s a very hard task, and it’s now very hard.</p><p>As for when it ends, you could say between 2001 and 2003, when the George W. Bush administration says the United States is no longer the benevolent, hegemonic, technological pioneer, we’re just another country and we’re going to follow our own interests. </p><p>You could say 2006, when my friend John Fernald says it becomes clear that information technology is actually not going to be as big a deal for most people as electrification or the internal combustion engine or modern materials. </p><p>You could say it’s 2007, when the idea that you actually needed to manage finance because it wasn’t trustworthy on its own turned out to be nonexistent.</p><p>Or you could say 2010, at a time when standard Keynesian theory would say the private sector has sat down on spending and the government sector needs to stand up, and even Barack Obama is saying no, the government must tighten its belt, and if the Democratic Congress actually passes any spending bills, I’m going to veto them.</p><p>You could also say it’s 2016 with the election of Donald Trump. And if I had to write it over again, I would say there’s a case for saying it’s 2022, with the return of major power war [between Russia and Ukraine]. </p><p>But sometime between 2002 and 2020 the whole complex of things that gave us the long 20th century—this technologically progressive, globalized United States, the furnace where the future was being forged—dissolves piece by piece, and it leaves us in a new world in which China and India are likely superpowers and in which dealing with global warming is likely to become all important. </p><p>You know, you go around the world and ask about Xi Jinping and hear back that he may have some rough edges, but at least he’s been tested as a competent administrator and someone who listens to advice, as opposed to the ethnonationalist politicians being thrown up by the industrial democracies right now—Trump was no prize and Boris Johnson was no prize. That’s a very strange configuration of things. And people have not quite wrapped their minds around this new world yet.</p><p>Another part of this new configuration is the high inflation we’ve been experiencing. What are people not wrapping their minds around with this highest inflation in 40 years?</p><p>On inflation, my view was that we were going to have some coming out of the plague. And it was going to be by and large, a good thing.</p><p>Let me explain: The plague has given us maybe 15 years of metaverse-style technological development in just over two years. And the economy has a new configuration: Fewer in-person workers in retail establishments, a lot more delivery orders, substantially more goods production, and also substantially more information entertainment and production as well. That requires that we shift a lot of people into new jobs, and you can’t cut anyone’s wages nominally without making them extremely angry at you, which means that in the expanding sectors, you have to raise wages in order to pull people into what are the growth sectors of the post-plague economy, and that’s going to give us a bunch of inflation. </p><p>Plus, when you reopen the economy, you discover all the supply-chain bottlenecks, and you need the prices of things where there are bottlenecks to go up in order to get people focused on how do we produce more of this stuff or how do we use less of it? </p><p>Your book is called Slouching Towards Utopia because you describe how we made so much progress in the 20th century and then stalled out, but now that we have gone through this accelerated metaverse evolution, do you think in a way we’ve sprinted towards a new kind of economic utopia, coming out of the plague?</p><p>I wrote in my book that I saw the best technical minds of the world turned to selling ads by figuring out how to scare people, so their eyeballs stayed glued to the screen. </p><p>And they figured out how we can use the screen you’re looking at to hack your brain so that you keep watching so we can sell you more ads. </p><p>So do you see this as a dystopia that we have emerged into?</p><p>It certainly has dystopian elements. Technological progress always has dystopian elements implicit in it, of which large-scale thermonuclear war is only one, and now we are also cooking the planet—how hot is it in Beijing today? Is reaching 120 degrees or so a normal climate kind of thing? We have gotten extremely good at advancing our technology but extremely poor at using it to build a proper socioeconomic political system that makes us happy. </p><p>We also shouldn’t underestimate the fact that while three-quarters of the world went to bed seriously hungry in 1870, now it’s only about one-fifteenth of the world that does so today. It’s a huge accomplishment when one of your chief mental concerns is where am I going to get my food tomorrow, rather than which of the 93 things I might want tomorrow should I pick up at the supermarket?</p><p>But revealed political preferences are that this does not make people happy or satisfied or thinking that things are going well.</p><p>So is it possible to recapture our momentum with economic progress, or is that asking the wrong question? It sounds like we still have a lot of progress, but you’re describing a crisis of values about how that technological progress is used.</p><p>Well, we certainly could recover our momentum.</p><p>The nice thing about invention is that two heads are not twice as good as one, but two heads are far better than that. And now the potential of the scientists and engineers that we could deploy, if we really wanted to, is absolutely enormous. Yes, the low-hanging fruit has been picked and it’s getting harder and harder to push the technological frontier forward. But our resources are still immense and they still scale.</p><p>There are people, my colleague and neighbor Fred Block among them, who think that one of the big things my book misses is the neoliberal turn in the United States that pushed corporations toward declaring maximum short-term profits, which means all the Xerox Parcs and the IBM Labs and the Bell Labs were essentially dismantled, and business started saying, instead of doing research, just figure out how to make what we’re making 1% cheaper next year. And the loss of those semi-public industrial research lab organizations—which because they were research-oriented were for the benefit of all, but were inside corporations and actually focused on technologies that might work—has been a huge minus and a major cause of the slowing down of technological progress. </p><p>Another huge cause of the slowdown is our failure to keep expanding education. When my father went to Harvard in 1955, it admitted 900 men and 300 women. Now it has 700 men and 900 women. That’s only gone up from 1,200 to 1,600 in total over 65 years, not a huge increase in capacity in a country that’s much more than doubled in size and in a world in which maybe five times more people are qualified for an Ivy League education. That failure to scale is really quite remarkable and amazing. </p><p>The problems with education at the private level are very much the NIMBYism, that is the not expanding capacity. At the public school level, it’s simply that we seem to be pretty good at what we do at teaching people things and preparing them for lives in which they appear to be very productive, but we have no idea how we do it. We really have zero idea about what parts of the educational process are useful. What are we doing that is simply a medieval ritual that was a response a long time ago to bad educational technology, and what things actually encourage people to think and talk and acquire skills so they can then better understand and deal with the world? American education is still an attractive thing to people from all over the world, but it needs to be reformed and we have very little idea of how to reform it. So it’s a big puzzle.</p><p>And understanding NIMBYism, the “not in my backyard” mentality, comes from how the creative destruction process indeed destroys a lot of things. But we live in a market economy where the only rights that really matter are property rights. And if you have property rights, then you tend to think you should have a voice about the surrounding built and natural environment not being changed without your buy-in, or at least without you getting bought off in some way. </p><p>Huge numbers of people are tremendously offended at the Biden student loan relief plan, but whoever we are, we have all had more than $20,000 of good or bad luck affect our lifetime income paths. There are a lot of people who went to school, and then with the totally crappy labor market of the past 15 years, it really didn’t pay off. So if your principal reaction is that those people are getting something they don’t deserve, that shows a very powerful thing about human psychology. </p><p>Also, many people do not like creative destruction at all. The idea that your job or your industry, the fabric of your life, might blow away if some rootless cosmopolis decides the business you work for no longer satisfies a maximum profitability test gets people very angry. These things have been animating progress and its effect on politics ever since the days of William Jennings Bryan. </p><p>Well that’s quite a note to end on, a reminder that these are not new concerns even if they feel that way, and that creative destruction versus NIMBYism is a major issue to resolve. </p><p>What I hope is that a lot of younger people read my book. When you get to my generation, you look around and it’s by and large a retrospective on what went wrong while we were supposedly in control. And I’d like the younger generation to have a stronger sense of how this kind of conflict between property rights and other rights on the one hand, in an environment of repeated creative destruction, on the other hand, has greatly hobbled our ability to actually use our huge technological powers to build a kind of human world as opposed to a world in which Beijing’s temperature reaches 120 degrees Fahrenheit and in which right now, killer robots are flying in the skies above Ukraine looking for people to kill.</p><p>You know, back when I was 12 or 13, there was a difference between the utopian science fiction novels with amazing technological competence and virtual reality and so forth, and the dystopian science fiction novels in which you had excessive heat from the greenhouse effect and killer robots, and yet it turns out in real life those have become something like the same thing. Yeah. We have managed to purchase both.</p><p>Wow, well that really sums it up. Ijust want to say I read your book and I devoured it. I really loved it.</p><p>Thank you. Oh, that’s excellent. That’s excellent. I remember [UC Berkeley colleague and former Obama advisor] Christina Romer saying, “Wow, this is actually readable.” And the more people who say that, the happier I am.</p>
