Frank Fukuyama & Sean Illing: Podcast

Francis: The democratic part of liberal democracy has to do with institutions like free and fair 
multi-party elections to gauge popular will. The liberal part really has to do with constraints on 
the power of the stated! rule of lawd! checks and balancesd! a leaderd! legitimated! isn't able to 
do simply whateverd! ind! violating the individual rights of peopled!. This legal constraint on 
powerd!

Francis: Three arguments in favor of a liberal political orderd!. Pragmaticd! protect life itself, 
by having a regime that allows tolerance of different points of viewd!. Protectd! human autonomyd! 
freedom in terms of what life course to selectd!. Economicd! market economyd! liberal societies 
tend to be the richest societies in the world.

Francis: Liberal societies do have their own cultured!. If people are nota€! tolerantd! public 
spiritedd! paying attentiond! enough tod! vote intelligentlyd! that kind of society is not going to 
workdi. Actual, real existing liberal societies have been built on top of non liberal foundations 
in which you have nationsd! culturesd! languaged! shared historyd!. that give your life a certain 
thickness that just being a liberal individual
doesn't necessarily give youd!. That creates a tension because sometimes those cultural foundations 
are exclusionaryd!. The trickd! is to have enough of a culture that peopled! are in a common 
endeavord!. Butd! thatd! shared core has to be tolerant and accessible.

Francis: A lot of the out-of-control resentments and anger in the United States is a product of 
peopled! losing sight of the real stakesd!. That's one sense in whichd! the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine hasd! been a useful reminder to people thatd! there ared! seriousd! tyrants and 
autocratsd!. I had an argument with a reasonably well known conservative intellectual who had gone 
partly MAGAd! and said: that we're livingd!
increasingly under a tyranny. And I saidd! it seems to me we're living in one of the freest 
societies in the world, [so] what do you see as so tyrannical? Andd! he saidd! thered™ s a group of 
nuns that are forced to distribute contraceptives in their medical practiced!. Maybe that was based 
on a wrongly reasoned court decision. Butd! thatd™ s not the worst violation of individual rights 
that I've encounteredd!. Thatd™ s something
that                                                                                                
                                                                                                   
you can only begin to believe if you live in a pretty peaceful and secure societyd!

Francis: Americans 20 years ago would disagree over policyd!. But thatd™ sd! morphed into affective 
polarizationd!. Youd™ re in this bizarre situation where being against vaccines is part of a new 
kind of conservative identityd!. When did opposition to rigorously tested vaccines become such an 
important issue that it's one of the fundamental causes of the political divide in this countryd!

Francis: To be successful and sustainable in the long run, youd! need to link liberalism with 
democracyd! a political mechanism to do a certain degree of redistributiond! to mitigated! social 
and economic inequalitiesd!. The most successful liberal societiesd! were the social democratic 
onesd! after World War II, where the elites had this recognition that a lot of the horrors of the 
early part of the 20th century were due tod! class
cleavagesd! a real effort to create a welfare stated! to try to be more inclusive in terms of 
having everybody sharing the benefits of economic growthd!. If you don't couple liberalism with a 
political order that is more egalitarian, it's not going to survived!

Francis: We need more redistributiond!. We needd! [a] universal healthcare system and itd™ sd! 
outrageous that we're the onlyd! rich country that doesn't have oned!

Francis: There's alsod! a problemd! of state capacity, that the American stated! is not very 
efficientd!. We just don't have the kind of bureaucratic and administrative traditions that a lot 
of other parliamentary democracies haved!

Francis: The clear and present danger to the American constitutional order comes from the 
rightdifrom Republicans that basically want to try to steal the next election in a way that they 
tried to steal the 2020 electiond! voter accessd! [and] the way that votes are countedd!. 
Republican state legislatures are trying to change the rules so that they're the ones that can 
determined! how many electors are sent to the electoral college to vote for
the next presidentd!. That is a really big threat to American democracy and to our constitutional 
orderd!

Francis: Neo-liberalismd! is a deformation of classical liberalism in the sense that it takes the 
ideas of property rights and market transactions and kind of absolutizes them and demonizes the 
state in a inappropriate way. Andd! there's a version of identity politics that itself then turns 
into something very illiberal when youd! start to say that it's our group characteristics that are 
the most essential things about usd!. I think the neo­
liberalism part is the easiest to fix. And we're already in the process of doing thatd!. The 
deformation on the progressive sided! is a little bit harder to walk back, because it does involve 
people's understanding of basic civil rights. And so it's harder to kind of explain what the 
problem is. But you know, I do think that that's something that's also not unfixabled!

Sean: I do think the age of liberalism is deadd!. You writed! liberal societiesd! cannot survive if 
they are unable to establish a hierarchy of factual truthd[created by elites of various sorts who 
act independently of those holding political power. The game is over as far as I can tell, if 
you're right about thatd!

Sean: Is anything that you've written in this book or anything you've said today feel like a 
revision to your doeend of historydD thesisd!. You talk about how the class issue has more or less 
been resolved in the Westd!. I'm not sure that was correct then. I feel like there's just no 
question that that's not true today. The underlying legal and social structures are not 
egalitarian. They're not meritocratic. And that is part of the reason you felt
compelled to write this book.d! And it's one of the many reasons people are disenchanted with the 
system that we have todayd!

Francis: I can imagine a political moment will come when people will take up that challenge and 
then fix the institutions the way they did during the 1930s, after the Great Depression or as a 
direct result of the Great Depressiond!. Buried in liberal theory is a belief in human rationality 
that ultimately people willd! listen to evidenced! deliberate, andd! the resultd! is going to be 
some socially productive conclusiond!. Modern
technology hasd! challenged thatd!. Itd™ s made the debate even more opend!. Butd! it providesd! 
big megaphones and opportunities for amplificationd! without regard tod! qualityd!. The biggest 
disappointment that I've felt in liberal democracy is thatd! many Americans could vote for somebody 
like Donald Trumpd!. Thatd™ s something that I worry about a lotd!

Francis: The fundamental argument for liberalism is this pragmatic one, that it's a way of 
governing societies peacefully that are highly diverse, and that people want to live in that kind 
of liberal society the most when they see what the alternatives ared!. And so liberalism has gone 
through these long swings, after the wars of religiond! challenged again in the 19th, early 20th 
centuries by out-of-control nationalismd!. People go back to
liberal values and institutions having experienced that ord! communist dictatorshipd!. [Then] 
people get complacentd! take liberalism for granted and once againd! start aspiring to a higher 
form of politicsd!. One of the things that gives me some hope is that, we have come out of previous 
cycles like this. The 1930s was pretty badd! and the world managed to survive that and restore a 
liberal orderd!

Frank Fukuyama: Liberalism & Its Discontents Quotes":

Liberalism... is individualist... egalitarian... universalist... and meliorist.... Liberal 
societies confer rights on individuals, the most fundamental of which is... autonomy... choices 
with regard to speech, association, belief, and ultimately political life... the right to own 
property... to undertake economic transactions... to a share of political power.... Liberal 
societies embed rights in formal law, and as a result tend to be highly procedural....
There have been three essential justifications for liberal societies.... Pragmatic... liberalism is 
a way of... allowing diverse populations to live peacefully.... Moral: liberalism protects basic 
human dignity.... Economic: liberalism promotes economic growth and all the good things that come 
from growth.... Liberalism has a strong association with certain forms of cognition, particularly 
the scientific method.  Liberalismd™ s most important

selling point remains the pragmatic one...

Populists on the right and progressives on the left are unhappy... with the way that liberalism has 
evolved.... Economic liberalism evolved into what is now labeled neoliberalism, which dramatically 
increased economic inequality and brought on devastating financial crises.... This inequality... is 
at the core of the progressive case against liberalism.  Personal autonomy expanded relentlessly, 
and came to be seen as a value that trumped all

other visions of the good life including those put forward by traditional religions and culture. 
Conservatives... felt that they were being actively discriminated against by mainstream society... 
using a host of undemocratic means... media, universities, the courts and executive power.... On 
the right... manipulate the electoral system... to guarantee that conservatives remain in power, 
regardless of democratic choice.... On the left. recognition of

groups rather than individuals based on fixed characteristics such as race and gender, as well as 
policies to equalize outcomes between them.... These threats to liberalism are not symmetrical....

Modern technology has challenged the liberal principle of free speech.... Overwhelm[ing] everyone 
with more information than they had ever had access to previously or could make sense of... 
information... of poor quality, false, or at times deliberately weaponized.... The large internet 
platforms operate on a business model that prioritizes virality and sensationalism over any type 
of... vetting.... Human cognition... people. begin with strong

preferences for the reality they prefer, and use their considerable cognitive skills to select 
empirical data and devise theories that support that reality in... a€oemotivated reasoning.a€D... 
Freedom of speech is... challenged... by concentrations of power that give certain actors great 
control over speech, and by the steady erosion of the zone of privacy.... The deliberative function 
of freedom of speech has been weakened. by excessive demands

for transparency... [and the] different kinds of fantasy worlds made possible by the shift of our 
social interactions to online communications...

Broad principles required to rebuild faith in classical liberalism.... Progressives for their part 
will have to accept the fact that roughly half the country does not agree with either their goals 
or their methods.  Conservatives need to come to terms with the countrya€™ s shifting racial and 
ethnic mix, the fact that women will continue to occupy the fullest range of positions, both 
professionally and privately, and that gender roles have changed

profoundly...

Certain state-level decisions... do actually challenge fundamental constitutional rights and affect 
the basic character of liberal democracy.... Jim Crow... returning in American politics. Republican 
legislatures in many states have passed or proposed bills that would effectively make it possible 
to overturn the results of democratic elections and make it harder to vote, especially for African 
Americans...

Public speech... governed by a host of norms.... There are well-established techniques for 
determining factual information, techniques that have been used for years in court proceedings, 
professional journalism, and in the scientific community.  There are other necessary norms 
promoting civility and reasoned discourse that underpin democratic deliberation in a liberal 
society. Norms regarding public speech should furthermore be applied

universally...

Our institutions need to focus on the rights of individuals rather than those of groups. People are 
never fully defined by their group memberships and continue to exercise individual agency. It may 
be important to understand the ways they have been shaped by their group identities, but social 
respect should take account of the individual choices that they make as well. Group recognition 
threatens not to remediate but to harden group
differences...

Successful liberal societies have their own culture and understanding of the good life, even if 
that vision may be thinner.... They cannot be neutral with regard to the values that are necessary 
to sustain themselves as liberal societies. They need to prioritize public-spiritedness, tolerance, 
open-mindedness, and active engagement in public affairs.... They need to prize innovation, 
entrepreneurship, and risk-taking.  A society of inward-looking

individuals interested only in maximizing their personal consumption will not be a society at 
all...
