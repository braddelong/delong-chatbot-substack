The Trump effect occurs most powerfully at the most hateful end of the spectrum (above 0.5 on the animus scale). And it's not happening for anyone on the Democratic side. Hating Christians and White people doesn't predict favorability toward any Democratic figures or the Democratic Party. So it isn't "anti-White racism" (whatever that means) motivating the left. It's not "both sides." This means that there is a faction in American politics that has moved from party to party, can be recruited from either party, and responds especially well to hatred of marginalized groups. They're not just Republicans or Democrats, they're a third faction that targets parties. THIS is the faction we, as Americans, should be worried about. "Bipartisanship" is not the answer to the problem. We need to confront this particular faction of Americans who have been uniquely visible and anti-democratic since before the Civil War (when they were Democrats)‚Ä¶ </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/LilyMasonPhD/status/1411053654635913216">https://twitter.com/LilyMasonPhD/status/1411053654635913216</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/yes-trumpism-is-fear-of-and-loathing?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/yes-trumpism-is-fear-of-and-loathing?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>One Video:</p><p></p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Beth Mole</strong>:&nbsp;<em>FDA Approves Pfizer‚Äôs Covid‚Äì19 Vaccine, Now Called Comirnaty</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/fda-approves-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-now-called-comirnaty/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/fda-approves-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-now-called-comirnaty/</a>&gt;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Jason Miciak</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Husband of Missouri State Rep Dies of COVID: Mocked People Who Wore Masks and Got the Jab</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://www.politicalflare.com/2021/08/husband-of-missouri-state-rep-dies-of-covid-mocked-people-who-wore-masks-and-got-the-jab/">https://www.politicalflare.com/2021/08/husband-of-missouri-state-rep-dies-of-covid-mocked-people-who-wore-masks-and-got-the-jab/</a>&gt;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Alan Cole</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Sorry, Deficit Hawks: Low Interest Rates Are Here to Stay</em>: ‚ÄòDeficit hawks have been waiting for their moment for seventeen years.

The Afghan economy stalled in 2012 after foreign aid started receding from a high of about 50% of GDP.

The big injection of foreign money did not translate into sustainable growth.

The press release came ahead of an FDA/CDC review (even though there is a throwaway sentence that says it will happen) or any data presented. I don‚Äôt understand how this is not undue pressure on the agencies to approve the booster, as stated. Second, where‚Äôs the data? Yes, the current administration has inherited the lack of data, but it‚Äôs mid-August. This policy by press release is confusing and undermines confidence because people on Twitter are now trying to reverse-engineer box plots from screenshots of other countries press releases (also without papers).

The core claims to fame of the Cuban healthcare system are the linked facts that the country has a low infant mortality rate (4.1 per 1,000, which is below the high-income country average of 5 per 1,000)‚Ä¶. Roberto Gonzalez shows that the flip side of Cuba‚Äôs abnormally low neo-natal fatality rate is an unusually high late-fetal death rate‚Ä¶. The most likely is that they are simply misclassifying the early-life deaths of premature infants as lost pregnancies. The other possible explanations would reflect even worse on the Cuban healthcare system‚Ä¶. If you look at late-fetal and early-neonatal deaths as a combined phenomenon, Cuba‚Äôs performance drops to well below that of rich countries as well as Chile and Costa Rica, though still good relative to Latin America as a whole‚Ä¶&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:40223294,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.slowboring.com/p/is-cuban-healthcare-actually-good&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:159185,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Slow Boring &quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec696af9-c7e4-4f1d-a582-6c0e5beffe69_768x768.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Is Cuban healthcare actually good? &quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;The New York Times recently ran a story about Covid-19 overwhelming the hospital infrastructure in Cuba, as it has whenever it‚Äôs hit lower-income countries who simply have fewer resources to dedicate to this kind of thing.

Vaccines just as effective against Delta infection as Alpha (about 80%). Somewhat less effective on symptomatic infection but still very strong (84%). Prior infection also quite good. Pfizer shows some evidence of waning immunity over 3 months. If trend continues, I can see why Biden admin is worried and pushing for boosters. AZ shows little waning immunity-good news for J&amp;J folks! Dosing interval doesn‚Äôt seem to matter, though above/below 9 week cutoff may not be that informative for the 3 week dosing schedule used in US. Final point-this is exactly the kind of study CDC and NIH should be doing and it‚Äôs a travesty they have not. But while the best time to start was yesterday, the second best time is today.
