There is no shortage of things happening right now. The U.S, is dealing with historically high

interest rates and economists predict the country is headed for the first recession in a decade. A 
revanchist Right Wing is waging a vicious culture war. A special Congressional Committee is laying

That social power should be in the hands of those who have the wealth, however acquired; and that 
those who have the wealth are also of the rightful controllers via their lobbying in their 
megaphones of our collective efforts to shape the distribution of wealtha€”that has got to be an 
even weirder doctrine than the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings, or the doctrine that the 
descendants of those who conquered Gaul with Clovis are the natural ruling class:

Cory Doctorow: a€~Provocative framing from DeLong: a€oeThese Chicago Boys are all right-wing 
Marxists. They buy the Marxian proposition that the state is an executive committee for rigging the 
economy in the interest of the ruling class. a€DBut they think that that is a good thing as long as 
the ruling class is based on wealth, however previously acquired. All their objections are to those 
who use some form of societal
power other than wealth to try to rig the economy in their interest. And while there is an argument 
that a wealth-based ruling class is in general best, it is a weak argumenta€!

Inflation is not a big problem. Inflation is a moderate problem for which the odds are 75-25 that 
it is already on the way to being solved. And inflation is a problem that we should be very 
grateful to have because the alternative would be the much worse problems that we had back in 2010:

Dan Pfeiffer: A Unified Dem Narrative for 2022: a€~President Obama began every discussion of 
messaging or meeting about a big speech by saying a€oeLeta€™ s start with whata€™ s true.a€na€! For 
a 2022 political narrative to be true, it should include the following elements. First, despite 
historic progress and record job growth, the American people are in a very sour mood about the 
economy. In a recent Pew Research poll,
93 percent of Americans said that inflation was a big problema€!

The nut a€~graphs from the other a€ceSlouching Toward UtopiaaCD (note: no final a€cesa€O):

George Scialabba (2018): Slouching Toward Utopia'. a€~The most popular booka€! in the United States 
in the nineteenth century was Uncle Toma€™ s Cabin. The nexta€! was Looking Backward by Edward 
BellamyaC! published in 1888a€! sold one million copiesa€!. More than 500 Bellamy Clubs were 
formeda€!. The book is an extended conversation in which each man explains his society to the 
other. a€ceHow do you
manage that?a€n [time-traveling protagonist] Julian asks incredulously about the new societya€™ s 
absence of poverty and inequality, its extremely short work week, its freedom of manners, and so 
on. Dr. Leete explains; Julian observes that such rational and humane arrangements would have 
seemed to his contemporaries utterly impossible and contrary to human nature; and then it is Dr. 
LeeteaC™ s turn to ask incredulously
a€oeBut why did you believe thaCaCO This seems like the right way to go about imagining a 
conversation between the present and the futureaC!. What features of our present moral consensus 
might we need to alter in order to make a rational and humane future?a€! All production is social 
production. The productive assets of every age are the joint product of all preceding ages, and all 
those born into the present are legitimately
joint heirs of those assets. And the same arguments for joint rather than individual inheritance of 
wealth created in the past apply to the distribution of income in the present. As Doctor Leete 
tells Julian: a€oeFrom the moment that men begin to live together and constitute even the rudest 
sort of society, self-support becomes impossible. As men grow more civilized and the subdivision of 
occupations and services is carried out, a
complex mutual dependence becomes the universal rule. Every man, however solitary may seem his 
occupation, is a member of a vast industrial partnership, as large as the nation, as large as 
humanity. How could you not see that this necessity of mutual dependence implies the duty and 
guarantee of mutual support?a€Da€! I imagine the 23rd century will aska€! a€oeHow could you have 
overlookeda€! the obvious and elementary
principle of fairness: from each according to her abilities, to each according to her need?a€Da€!

I am not sure that this is right. And, while it is not good news, we still have multiple vaccine 
doses, Paxlovid, and company. Yes, wear masks in crowded indoor settings. Yes, we will probably 
never again to send into crowded, humid, warm batcaves and sing. But do not panic:

Eric Topol: A Reinfection Red Flag'. a€~Findings from >250,000 people with 1 infection. ~39,000 
people with 2 or more infections, and nearly 5.4 million uninfected controlsa€!. The comparison of 
people with reinfections vs those with only 1 infection. Note the doubling of all-cause mortality, 
cardiovascular, and lung adverse outcomes, 3-fold risk of hospitalization, and impact on other 
health domainsa€!. Next is the durability
of these adverse outcomesa€! much of the hit was up front, but persistent increased risk was 
evident for most endpoints throughout the 6 months follow-upa€!. Finallya€! with additional 
episodes of Covid, for every outcome there was a stepwise increased riska€! relativea€! and 
absolutea€!. Rinfection was quite rare before the Omicron wave hit, at 1% or less through the Delta 
variant wave. But now reinfections have become
much more common. Why?a€! The new Omicron subvariantsa€! due to the new spike mutations we are 
getting exposed toa€!. Despite lack of warnings by CDC, there should be gearing up with N95/KN95 
masks, distancing when possible, attention to ventilation, air filtration, and all of the 
non-pharmacologic measures that we have at our disposala€!. There is simply no excuse for why these 
vaccines are not being hyper-
aggressively pursueda€!

The answer as to how to create a society in which the poor or not imprisoned by the rich 
collectively monopolize access to the resources that the poor need to survive is and has always 
been what it was in classical Greece in the -5000: cancel the debts, and redistribute the land. 
Without an equitable distribution of social power, society cannot be "resilient" because society 
is, instead, geared to extract labor and value from the poor and give it to the rich, so
the rich can live leisured and comfortable lives. You have to give those who would otherwise be 
poor direct access to and control over resources. And in a market economy, that means 
pre-distributiona€’’eliminating choke points that make some particular resources have great 
scarcity valuea€”and redistribution as well. But to say that it is "government" and "market" that 
must "solve" the problem of "resilience" is, I think, to miss the big point:

Rajiv Sethi: The Resilient Society: a€~By Markus BrunnermeieraG!. In a resilient societyaGI we can 
aGcetake more chances and embrace more opportunities^’’because the shocks will be less detrimental 
.a€Da€! But how might households and firms be induced to take actions that they would otherwise 
prefer not to take, in order that the system as a whole becomes more resilient? Here, Brunnermeier 
provides few concrete
answers, other than to recognize that the solution involves both markets and governmentaG!
