This was very, very nice to see:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Paul Krugman</strong>: <em>Technology &amp; the Triumph of Pessimism</em>: ‘“Slouching Towards Utopia,” by Brad DeLong… a magisterial history of what DeLong calls the “long 20th century,” running from 1870 to 2010, an era that he says… was shaped overwhelmingly by the economic consequences of technological progress…. For the great bulk of human history… Malthus was right: There were many technological innovations over the course of the millenniums, but the benefits of these innovations were always swallowed up by population growth, driving living standards for most people back down to the edge of subsistence…. Around 1870, however, the world entered an era of sustained rapid technological development that was unlike anything that had happened before; each successive generation found itself living in a new world, utterly transformed from the world into which its parents had been born…. </p><p>There are two great puzzles…. </p><p>The first is why this happened. DeLong argues that there were three great “meta-innovations” (my term, not his)—innovations that enabled innovation itself. These were the rise of large corporations, the invention of the industrial research lab and globalization…. </p><p>The second is why all this technological progress hasn’t made society better than it has. One thing I hadn’t fully realized until reading “Slouching Towards Utopia” is the extent to which progress hasn’t brought felicity. Over the 140 years DeLong surveys, there have been only two eras during which the Western world felt generally optimistic about the way things were going…. The first… was the 40 or so years leading up to 1914, when people began to realize just how much progress was being made and started to take it for granted…. The second… was the “30 glorious years”… after World War II when social democracy… seemed to be producing not Utopia, but the most decent societies humanity had ever known. But that era, too, came to an end, partly in the face of economic setbacks, but even more so in the face of ever more bitter politics…. </p><p>The progress that brought us on-demand streaming music hasn’t made us satisfied or optimistic. DeLong offers some explanations for this disconnect, which I find interesting but not wholly persuasive. But his book definitely asks the right questions and teaches us a lot of crucial history along the way…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?CCPAOptOut=true&amp;emc=edit_pk_20220628&amp;instance_id=65240&amp;nl=paul-krugman&amp;productCode=PK&amp;regi_id=64675225&amp;segment_id=97027&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fa3d55f2f-9435-5a0a-86fe-cd15ed2920f4&amp;user_id=8a3fce2ae25b5435f449ab64b4e3e880">https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?CCPAOptOut=true&amp;emc=edit_pk_20220628&amp;instance_id=65240&amp;nl=paul-krugman&amp;productCode=PK&amp;regi_id=64675225&amp;segment_id=97027&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fa3d55f2f-9435-5a0a-86fe-cd15ed2920f4&amp;user_id=8a3fce2ae25b5435f449ab64b4e3e880</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Of course, the industrial research lab, full globalization, and the modern corporation were not the only things going on as far as generators of global technological progress—discovery, development, deployment, and diffusion—were concerned. But everything before had only pushed worldwide technological progress up to a proportional rate of 0.45%/year, on the edge of but not quite to disspell the Devil of Malthus. And as of 1870 it was not at all clear that that rate of technological progress could be sustained. There had been “efflorescences” before, but they had not lasted. Was there as of 1870 yet sufficient reason to imagine that the Industrial Revolution was more than just another such “efflorescence”, and that London would escape the fate of Nineveh, or Tyre?</p><p>It is after 1870 that the worldwide average rate of technological progress explodes: what Simon Kuznets first named “Modern Economic Growth” Growth jumped up from the 0.45%/year average proportional rate of 1770-1870 to the 2.1%/year average of 1870-2010. A full revolution in the global mode of production—a doubling of humanity’s technological competence—took 150 years at the pace of 1770-1870. It took only 33 years after 1870.</p><p>If one wanted to say that each <em>quantitative</em> doubling of human technological capability, measured in the sense of being able to support the same population at twice as high a living standard, is an equal <em>qualitative</em> change in the underlying mode of production, then starting from the standpoint of the 2035 built-out Information Age and looking backward in time, I see ten different “modes of the forces of production” since the dawn of agriculture:</p><div><hr></div><h3>Modes of the Forces Production in History</h3><p><strong>2035:    Information Age<br>2002:    Global Value-Chain Age<br>1969:     Mass Consumption Age<br>1936:     Mass Production Age<br>1903:     Industrial Age<br>1870:      Steam-Power Age<br>1605:      Imperial-Commercial Age<br>1:            Late Agrarian Age (feudal, ancient, asiatic)<br>-1300:    Bronze Age<br>-4900:   Neolithic Age<br>-13000:  Mesolithic Age</strong></p><div><hr></div><p>If one follows this line of thought, then out of our ten “modes of production” in the past ten-thousand years, fully six have been in the past 200. If one thinks that on top of the forces there have to be built institutions that are the relations of production, and that on top of the forces-relations base one has to build the institutions that are the superstructures of society, then it is quite clear why not just utopia but even stable patterns of social order have been so hard to build in the Modern Economic Growth Age that began in 1870: processes of institutional evolution and adjustment that we used to have hundreds or thousands of years to get right and file the rough edges off now take mere decades.</p><div><hr></div><p>And I have written back:</p><p><strong>Brad DeLong</strong>: Thank you very much. <strong>Blush</strong>.

Because industrial economies continually make and put into practice technical and organizational innovations… their occupational structures change significantly in a generation…. No one can expect to follow in the family profession…. Training must be much more explicit, be couched in a far more universal idiom, and emphasize understanding and manipulating nearly context-free symbols…. It must in short take on the characteristics formerly associated with the literate High Cultures of Agraria…. States become the protectors of High Cultures, of “idioms”; nationalism is the demand that each state succor and contain one and only one nation, one idiom…. Faced with a difference between one’s own idiom and that needed for success, people either acquire the latter, or see that their children do (assimilation); force their own idiom into prominence (successful nationalism); or fester. Thus industrialism begets nationalism, and nationalism begets nations…. It is hard to decide whether nationalists or anti-nationalists will find <em>Nations and Nationalism</em> more disturbing; rootless cosmopolitan though I am, it changed my mind on a great many subjects. This is already a rare enough achievement for a philosopher or social scientist…. Unfortunately for those of us not enamoured of nationalism, he wasn’t talking rubbish at all…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313155341/http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/nations-and-nationalism/">https://web.archive.org/web/20130313155341/http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/nations-and-nationalism/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>A successful aggregator-monopolist does not manage to extract all of the consumer surplus for itself—the fact that you could spend your money on other things that are imperfect substitutes limits surplus extraction to about half. Unfortunately, another quarter of the consumer surplus vanishes to deadweight loss: monopoly is not a good market structure.</p><p>And, on the producer-surplus side, Amazon’s shift from being an intermediary that aggregates consumer information to guide users’ attention to where it is likely to be best-satisfied to one that makes producers pay through the nose for that attention—that means that Amazon is likely to grab a huge proportion of producer surplus as well.</p><p>Thus I very, very much hope Web3 will come to our rescue, somehow, soon:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Adrian Hon</strong>: <em>The Forever War</em>: ‘Review of <em>Book Wars: The Digital Revolution in Publishing</em> by John Thompson….

Substack is notable because it has cracked the seemingly impossible problem of getting readers to pay for non-fiction words on a screen—to the tune of $5–10 a month each, which amounts to roughly £45–75 a year. Email newsletters certainly aren’t a get-rich-quick scheme, but it’s working well for a lot of authors….
