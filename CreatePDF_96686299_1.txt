From 70,000 to 10,000 Years Ago

70,000 years ago, back in the Early Paleolithic Age, there were perhaps 100,000 of wsa€”100,000 
East African plains apes who looked like us, moved like us, acted like us, talked like us, and from 
whom the overwhelming proportion of all of our heredity is derived. Yes, we have small admixtures 
(5%?) from other groups and subspecies and maybe even species, but overwhelmingly we are those 
proto-hundred-thousand's children. Each of them who has living
descendants today has a placea€”has an astronomical number of placesa€”on each of our family trees. 
(No, I do not believe that the Khoisan are in any sense a€oea separate creationa€D, diverging from 
those who became the rest of us 200,000 years agoa€”lots of back-and-forth gene flow over those 
200,000 years.)

Back then we were very, very smart herd animals. We gathered, we hunted (some), we protected 
ourselves, we made stone and wood tools, we understood our environment, we manipulated our 
environment, we communicated with each other, we cooperated and we fought, we talked, and we did 
the things that humans.

Flash-forward 20,000 years to 50,000 years ago, on what we think was the eve or possibly in the 
middle of the overwhelming majority of our then-ancestorsa€™ final major radiation-migration out of 
the Horn of Africa, to the rest of Africa, and across the Red Sea to the wider world. There were 
then, perhaps, one million of us. We had been very successful in amplifying our numbers, almost 
surely by crowding our near-cousins out of our common ecological
niche in the Horn of Africa. We surely had some evolutionary edge relative to them, but what?

Our standard of living back then? If we had to slot it into emerging-markets standards of living in 
the world today, we might call it 3.50 dollars a day. Poverty, but not quite what the United 
Nations calls extreme poverty: natural resources were not scarce, our knowledge of our east African 
environment was profound, and we probably had to spend a little more than one-third of our waking 
hours collecting 2000 calories plus essential nutrients each day, plus
enough shelter and fire and clothing that we were not unduly wet or cold. We were buff: life was 
strenuous. But we were short-lived: a life expectancy at birth of perhaps 25-30, for hauling around 
a family in our then-semi-nomadic lifestyle was dangerous: life was strenuous. And we were in rough 
ecological balance. The level of our technology? Normalized to our benchmark H 1870 = 1.0, that 
guessed standard of living and that guess at our then-numbers
computes a level 77-48000 = 0.0256 back 50,000 years ago,

Flash-forward another 40,000 years, to 10,000 years ago, on the very eve of the invention/discovery 
of agriculture and of animal domestication. Things were much the same, save that there were then 
not one million of us in East Africa but rather perhaps two-and-a-half million of us, well, pretty 
much everywhere. Our living standards were much the same as they had been. We had better tools, but 
they were of stone and wood, plus fur and fiber, and not yet
metal: it was still the Mesolithic Age. Our knowledge of our environments”or rather 
environmentsa€”was more profound, and so was our power to manipulate them. But in each environment 
we lived in we found ourselves in rough ecological balance. As of -8000 the index H of human 
technological capabilities stands at 3DD»-8000 = 0.04.

Over the Paleolithic Era of stone and the Mesolithic Era of stone plus some pottery and textiles 
from 70 to 10 thousand years ago, the rate at which the stock of useful ideas about technology and 
organization was growing was 0.001% per yeara€”and, with standards of living stagnant at an average 
of $3.5 dollars a day or so, the rate of growth of human populations was twice that: 0.002% per 
year, or 0.05% per generation: a typical generation would see, an
average, 2000 people turn into 2001. What if growth over the generations had been much faster? 
Then, given thea€”very slow, 0.001% per yeara€”rate of growth in useful ideas H, the population 
finds itself without sufficient resources to sustain itself and drops. What if growth over the 
generations had been much slower? The population would find itself better-nourished, with 
children's immune systems less compromised and women ovulating more regularly,
and population growth would have accelerated. Malthusian equilibrium thus kept population growing 
along with useful ideas, and the rate of growth of useful ideas was very slow.

The Neolithic Revolution and the Agrarian Age to 1500, and Even After

Then, at the end of the gatherer-hunter age, comes the upward leap (or was it an upward leap) of 
the Neolithica€”a€oeNew Stonea€Ua€’’revolution. The proportional rate of growth of ideas jumped up, 
massively, eleven-fold to 0.011% per year, during the -8000 to -6000 Neolithic Revolution: herding 
and agriculture were really good ideas. 2000 years after -8000 we are (poor) agriculturalists and 
(unsophisticated) herders of barely domesticated animals, with a
human population of perhaps 7 million, but a lower living standard of perhaps 2.50 dollars a day, 
with an index dDD»-6000 = 0.051.

Why a 2,5-fold multiplication of population in 2000 years or so? Because living was easier when you 
were sedentary or semi-sedentary: you no longer had to carry babies substantial distances, and you 
could accumulate more useful stuff than you could personally carry. Plus even early agriculture and 
herding were very productive relative to what had come before. Since life was easier, more babies 
survived to grow up and themselves reproduce.

Why a fall in the standard of living? Because population grew until humanity was once again in 
ecological balance, with population expanded to the environment's carrying capacity given 
technology and organization. But what keeps population from growing further? The fact that life has 
become harder again. But it became harder in a different way: agriculturalists are 
shortera€’’figureabout threeinches, 7.5 centimetersa€’’malnourished, prone to endemic
diseases, and vulnerable to plagues relative to gatherer-hunters. Biologically, it would seem much 
better to be a typical person in the gatherer-hunter than in the post-Neolithic Revolution agrarian 
age: your fife expectancy is no less, your daily fife presents you with more interesting and less 
boring cognitive problems, and you are much more buff and swole.

Jared Diamond believesa€”or at least whoever wrote the title of his article belie vesa€’’that the 
invention of agriculture was, as the title says, a bad mistaker: humans would be better-off had we 
remained gatherer-hunters.

Technological progressa€”the discovery, invention, development, deployment, and diffusion of useful 
and valuable ideas about how to manipulate nature and organize humansa€’’continued at 0.018% per 
year from -6000 to -3000, the end of the Stone and the start of the Literacy and Bronze Age. In the 
Bronze and then the Iron Age agriculture, craftwork, organization, literacy, and more 
advancecivilization: from -3000 to -1000, and then from -1000 BCto the
year 1, we see H rise at first 0.03% per year, and then 0.06% per year, with a year-150 human 
population of 200 million. St least half of that year-150 population was collected in three great 
empiresa€’’Roman, Parthian, and Hana€’’enforcing imperial peace, and together spanning Eurasia from 
what is now Vladivostok to Cadiz and from Hainan to Scotland.

With all that comes further development of agriculture, craftwork, organization, literacy, 
civilization: by year 150 the index 5DD» = 0.27, but our standard of living is not significantly 
higher for there are now 200 million of us on the globe.

Malthusian Equilibrium

This is a Malthusian Equilibrium', a vast tenfold improvements in technological and organizational 
capabilities from -6000 to 1500, from 0.43 to 0.43; but virtually all of that improvement going to 
support a 70-fold increase in human population; and with only 1/100 the potential natural resources 
at their disposal, the typical peasant or craftsman in 1500 was able to use that technology to eek 
out roughly the same standard of living as their predecessors 7.5
millennia before.

There is definitely a spurious precision here.

Even if we could gain universal assent as to technological capability in, say, ceramics and each of 
the other aspects of human productivity and creativity, squashing multi-dimensional objects down 
into a single one-dimensional index simply cannot be done. All we can say is that if there were an 
economy simple enough for such an index to be accurate, and if its levels of productivity 
corresponded to those we assign to the real history, then its index of human
technological and organizational capabilities would be our H.

Nevertheless, I find such a framework very useful as a metaphor in organizing my thoughts. The 
numbers assigned to H do carry meaning. Look at pottery in -8000, in year 150, and in 1500:

Technology in Ceramics, -8000 to 1500: Jomon,
Roman, Ming


Queen Victoria does not appear to have been a much better queen than Queen Elizabeth. But, from all 
historical accounts, Gloriana appears to have been perhaps four times as happy as happy a woman as 
the Widow of Windsor.

In this long Agrarian Age of Malthusian equilibrium from -6000 to sometime between 1500 and 1930, 
depending where you lived, humanity (except for a relatively narrow slice of aristocrats at the top 
of the social hierarchy, and those lucky enough to be able to lick up the crumbs that fell from the 
aristocratsa€™ tables) lived in what we would regard as dire poverty. They were close to the edge 
of subsistence, inthe sense that had the population beeneven
moderately poorer, the population would not have managed to reproduce itself in the next 
generation: too many women would have missed ovulation from malnutrition, too many malnourished 
children with compromised immune systems would have been taken out by the common cold, and too 
little sanitation made it a truly golden age for plague and dysentery.

Consider: a preindustrial pre-artificial birth-control population that is nutritionally unstressed 
will triple in numbers every 50 years or so. That was the experience of the conquistadores and 
their descendants in Latin America. That was the experience of the English and French settlers 
coming in behind the waves of plague and genocide that had decimated the indigenousAmerindian 
population in North America. That was the experience of thePolish, Ukrainian,
and Russian settlers on the Pontic-Caspian steppe, after the armies of the gunpowder empires, most 
notably of Yekaterina II Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov (neA© Sophie),Tsarina of All the Russias, drove 
out the horse nomads and opened the black-earth regions to the plow.

But back in the Agrarian Age it took the human population not 50 but 1500 years to triple. The 
population in the year 1500 of 500 million was only three times what it had been in the year one. 
And yet is there anything that parents would work harder for and spend more effort on than trying 
to ensure that their children would survive to reproduce? Yet they could not do so, at least not to 
any extent to make the rate of population growth more than glacial. And
note that this was not because of a shortage of births: 8 pregnancies is typical for an Agrarian 
Age woman. Queen Anne Stuart had 17.

The fact that, in the Agrarian Age, human populations took not 50 but 1500 years to triple a 
measure of how poor, in the sense of being extraordinarily close to a biological 
population-sustaining limit humanity was back then.

Agrarian-Age historical patterns do appear to fit the Malthusian model. Under conditions of great 
nutritional stress, no artificial birth control and high infant mortality, families are desperate 
to have as many children as sociologically possible. They need to increase the chances that at 
least one child will survive to to care for them in their old age, should they attain one, and to 
carry on their memory. Thus a richer economy sees a higher rate of population growth.
Given the absolutely glacial rate of technological progress and the discovery and deployment of 
ideasa€”maybe a 5% increase in the value of ideas over a centurya€”the resulting increase in 
population causes resource scarcity: smaller farm sizes. That pushes the standard of living down, 
until women stop ovulating regularly and children's immune systems are so compromised that they are 
carried off by the common cold.

What if something happens to disturb the system either to increase or decrease the population by a 
lot or to jump up or down the level of the ideas stock or of resources? Then either a richer or 
poorer society will lead population growth to either accelerate or population to fall, until we are 
once again back at Malthusian stagnation.

Inequality and Exploitation

Would it have been better to have been a working-class Briton around 1800 or a gatherer-hunter 
before -8000? Probably a gatherer-hunter.

On the one hand, if you are a gatherer-hunter you are buff! But there is lots of within-humanity 
violence: you run a substantial risk of being stabbed to death and having to watch your babies' 
brains bashed out against rocks. On the other hand, if you are an agriculturalist, you, have a 
chance of a long slow death from starvationand malnutrition. You are stunted, weak, with very bad 
teeth, and probably stupid from protein deprivation in utero. I don't think we
really know what typical agrarian age diets did to brain function. We do know that they, that 
agrarian age mother's found themselves significantly compromised health-wise as the infant to be 
leeches calcium out of the mother's bones and teeth to build itself.

There is little to choose with respect to life expectancy. Infant mortality appears to be the same.

Oh: and gatherer-hunters face interesting lives in which they constantly solve environmental and 
social puzzles, sort of a la a slow-motion version of Super Mario. By contrast, the agrarian age 
sees you doing the same damn thing day after day after day. Plus the Agrarian Age brings 
patriarchy, and much more wealth and statusinequality. This is so unlessyou are lucky enough to be 
one of the lords and masters. But if you arenot, you runthe risk that the lords
and masters will find a way to torment you impressively to reinforce the principle that people 
should pay their rent and their taxes on time and in full. This is almost surely a big negative sum 
in the Agrarian Age: There are always many more to be dominated than there are to feel good about 
themselves because they dominate.

In this Agrarian-Age, from the discovery of agriculture on up to and beyond 1500, civilizationa€“if 
you want to call it thata€’’depended almost entirely on exploitation. It needed an upper class that 
took from the peasants and craft-workers enough of the stuff they produced to give the elite a 
better-than-desperately-poor standard of living, and also allow them, most of the time, to maintain 
control.
Once people began to farm, especially farm grains, they become relatively stationary: 
Agriculturalists cannot carry their resources away with them. Their wealth is in their land and the 
crops they are growing, rather than in their heads and in the tools they carry. Thus farmers cannot 
run away when thugs-with-spears show up, and demand half their crop.

Before 1870, there was no possibility that humanity could bake an economic pie that was 
sufficiently large for everyone to potentially have enough. Slow technological progress, the 
necessity under patriarchy of trying to have more sons in the hope that at least one would survive, 
and natural resource scarcitya€’’those put mankind under the Malthusian harrow, in dire poverty. 
Thus most of governance back then, and most social energy back then, was directed at
some elite's (a) running a force-and-fraud, exploitation-and-domination machine, (b) elbowing other 
potential elites out of the way, and then (c) utilizing their ill-gotten gains in building a high 
culture in which the non-A©lite were villains and churns. The pressures making for human 
inequality, and for gross human inequality, were enormous and inescapable.

Thus, for most of recorded human history, history as studied by non-"presentist" historians 
consisted of this: studying how those who benefited from the operation of the 
exploitation-and-domination machine cooperated in building and enjoying their high culture and came 
into conflict within and between civilizations, as they carried out their respective roles as 
masters, thugs-with-spears(and later thugs-with-gunpowder-weapons), order-giving bureaucrats,
record-keeping accountants, and propagandists.

Thus "modes of domination" were as important as modes of production, at least, in the old days. And 
thus there are four other dimensions of global economic history worth noting at this pointa€”all 
having to do with inequality and distribution.

Thus "modes of domination" were as important as modes of production, at least, in the old days. And 
thus there are four other dimensions of global economic history worth noting at this pointa€”all 
having to do with inequality and distribution.

• The first is the extraction-status dimension: slavery, serfdom, & lesser degrees of status 
unfreedom.

• The second is the general within-society across-household inequality dimension: plutocracy.

• The third is the gender dimension: patriarchy

• And the fourth is the cross-country inequality dimension: divergence (of national economies).

That humanity was unequal does not mean that the upper class back then was rich. It does not mean 
that the standard of living of the upper class back in the Agrarian Age would really impress us. 
They may have been famous. But from our standpoint they were not really rich.

For one thing, life expectancy was short, even for the upper class: 20 to 30 at birth, rather than 
our 80 or so. Some plague might will get you. And if you were female, childbed might will get you 
as well. Of British queens, one in seven in the years from 1000 up to 1650 died in childbed. Males 
escaped childbed mortality, and also by-and-large escaped the extra mortality from nursingsick 
children with infectious diseases. But if youwere male or unlucky and
female you faced risks from human violence. 1/3 of English monarchs from William the Conqueror up 
to 1650 either died in battle, were assassinated, or were murdered after some sham show of judicial 
process. Probably the risks of violent death at the hands of others were lower for people who were 
not so eminent. Probably.

For another, lots of things that we think of as nice to have, but not as especially crucial or key 
or even valuable, were way out of their reach of even the richest during and after the Agrarian 
age. Suppose you lived in 1610. Suppose you wanted, in your house, to watch a horror mo 
viea€’’strike that, no movies: a horror playa€’’something about witches or devils or such, and 
wanted to watch it in your house.One person in all the island of Great Britain could do
that. If you wanted to do that, you had better be named James I Stuart, you had better be King of 
England and Scotland, and your acting company had better have either Shakespearea€™ s MacBeth or 
Marlowea€™ s Dr. Faustus in repertory.

And before: If you were Gilgamesh, King of Uruk in the year -3000, What could you do? You could 
boss people around yesa€“get the men to build walls and canals and to drill as soldiers, and get 
the women to serve and service you. You could drink beera€”wine and distillation had not yet been 
invented. You could eat flatbread or porridge. You could eat meat every daya€”which your subjects 
could eat only rarely. You could eat honeya€”which few people
could do. And honey was important: do we have any Melissas or Deborahs out there?

You could sit on cushions stuffed with wool.

But, for Gilgamesh, to even get cedar or some other wood for your walls or floorsa€”that required a 
major military expedition. With associated transport logistics.

Back then, in the Agrarian Age, human technological progress was glacially slow. And here there is 
a puzzle. For progress and sophistication in the arts, in politics, in religion, in social 
Organization^’’ancient Athens even heard its equivalent of keeping up with the Kardashians, only 
the star was named Phryne and not Kim. But not just in the level of technology but in the pace of 
technological advance, we moderns far outstrip the ancients in a way that we do
not In, say, composing poetry.

Efflorescences and Dark Ages

And even though life back in the Agrarian Age was nasty brutish and short, it was not always the 
same. There were civilizational efflorescences. They were empires that brought peace and relative 
prosperity to large chunks of the land. There were also dark ages and barbarian invasions and 
civilization-shaking catastrophes as well. There was a history of economic growth and decline in 
the Agrarian Age: it was not all stasis and stagnation. We will consider those
next time.

The Late-Antiquity Pause

Changes to the evolution of the human economy begin to emerge after the year 150. But the first 
change is not, from the standpoint of the potential for human progress, a good one.

Then from 150 or so to 800 it looks like we get a definite downshift: the Late-Antiquity Pause. We 
do not get a further acceleration to more than 0.06%/year of technology growth. We get a fall to a 
rate of 0.14%/year, a slower rate of technology growth than humanity had seen since before the 
start of the Bronze Age. Something goes wrong.There is the crisisof the Antonine Dynasty in 
theRoman Empire at one end, the collapse of the Han Empire at the other
end, shortly followed by the collapse of the Parthian Empire and the Indo-Greek kingdoms under 
pressure a Sassanians, Kushans, Hephthalites, and others.

Instead of the near-tripling from the year 150 to the year 800 in population that the Axial Age of 
-1000 to 150 would have led us to expect, human population in 800 is only 20% above population in 
the year 150. Ideas growtha€”and population growtha€’’slowed drastically. From 150 to 1500, each 
person on the globe contributed only 1/8 asmuchto ideas growth as theiraxial-age predecessors. And 
it was still the case that essentially all improvementsin
technology flowed through to increasing population, with essentially none flowing through to higher 
labor efficiency, productivity, and living standards for the typical human. The sources of this 
Late-Antiquity are a substantial mystery, surrounded by speculation, but with little in the way of 
solid knowledge.

MediASval Recovery, Technological Breakout, and Dispelling the Ensorcellment of the Devil of 
Malthus

But things then recover, somewhat: 800 to 1500 see technology growth recover to 0.05%/year. So 
progress in technological advance does, however, continue. By the year 1500 we have dDD» = 0.43. 
But we also have 500 million humans, compared to the 200 million of year 150 or the 5 million of 
year -6000. Typical standards of living in 1500? They still seem much the same: still 2.5 dollars a 
day.
Thereafter come the really big changes. Thereafter comes the breakout:

• a growth rate of useful ideas of 0.15% per year during the 1500-1770 Imperial-Commercial 
Revolution Age.

• a growth rate of useful ideas of 0.44% per year during the 1770-1870 Industrial Revolution Age.

• a growth rate of useful ideas averaging 2.06% per year during the post-1870 Modern Economic 
Growth Era.

•  a population explosion, and then a slowdown toward zero population growth as prosperity brings 
female education, female education brings greater female autonomy, and literate women with rights 
to own property find that there are other ways to gain and maintain social power than to try as 
hard as possible to become the mother of many sons and daughters.

From 1500 to 1770 to 1870a€”over, first, the Imperial-Commercial Revolution and, second, the 
Industrial Revolution erasa€”our quantitative index H grows from 0.43 to 0.64 to 1.0. And this time 
there was some increase in typical standards of living: figure a world in 1870 with $3.5 a day per 
person, albeit much more unevenly distributed. But, still, the overwhelming bulk of improvements in 
human technology and organization went to supporting a larger
population: the 500 million of 1500 had grown to 1.3 billion by 1870, as better living standards 
lowered death rates worldwide.

From 1870 to 2020, in our era of Modern Economic Growth, our H has risen from 1 to 27. Our 
population has risen from 1.3 to 8 billion. And our resources from $3.5 to $32 a day.
From this perspective, there are two big questions in post-Neolithic Revolution global economic 
history:

1. Why was there and what determined the pace of the triple accelerations in growth to 0.15% and 
then 0.44% and now 2.06% per year?

2. Why was there and what determined thea€”much, much, much slowera€”pace of growth of 0.03% per 
year (with a -1000 to 1 temporary and with a post-800 perhaps permanent jump up) from the -3000 
invention of writing to 1500?.

For another, lots of things that we think of as nice to have, but not as especially crucial or key 
or even valuable, were way out of their reach of even the richest during and after the Agrarian 
age. Suppose you lived in 1610. Suppose you wanted, in your house, to watch a horror mo 
viea€’’strike that, no movies: a horror playa€’’something about witches or devils or such, and 
wanted to watch it in your house. One person in all the island of Great Britain could do
that. If you wanted to do that, you had better be named James I Stuart, you had better be King of 
England and Scotland, and your acting company had better have either Shakespearea€™ s MacBeth or 
Marlowea€™ s Dr. Faustus in repertory.

And before: If you were Gilgamesh, King of Uruk in the year -3000, What could you do? You could 
boss people around yesa€“get the men to build walls and canals and to drill as soldiers, and get 
the women to serve and service you. You could drink beera€”wine and distillation had not yet been 
invented. You could eat flatbread or porridge. You could eat meat every daya€”which your subjects 
could eat only rarely. You could eat honeya€”which few people
could do. And honey was important: do we have any Melissas or Deborahs out there?

You could sit on cushions stuffed with wool.

But, for Gilgamesh, to even get cedar or some other wood for your walls or floorsa€”that required a 
major military expedition. With associated transport logistics.
