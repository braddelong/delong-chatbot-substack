That is $10 billion a year of a valuable, productive resource that can then be devoted to putting people to work and hence hastening recovery and growth. But in a $70 trillion a year world economy, things would have to be very strange indeed, and there would have to be very precise bottlenecks, multipliers, and accelerators to expect such an 0.015% augmentation of private sector productive resources to do much. </p><p>It seemed to me beforehand that quantitive easing would have big effects only if it worked not through portfolio balance and resource augmentation channels, but rather, through confidence-building and signaling. </p><p>But I did not really understand how doing something new and surprising of extraordinary headline-number magnitude, but with little effect on real resource flows, was thought likely to accomplish much...</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://iai.tv/live">https://iai.tv/live</a>&gt;</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://open.substack.com/chat/posts/0cf9bad3-2432-444b-a54f-cbfd619a9bcc?utm_source=share">https://open.substack.com/chat/posts/0cf9bad3-2432-444b-a54f-cbfd619a9bcc?utm_source=share</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/microblogging-gillian-tett-carmen?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/microblogging-gillian-tett-carmen?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/microblogging-gillian-tett-carmen/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/microblogging-gillian-tett-carmen/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>
