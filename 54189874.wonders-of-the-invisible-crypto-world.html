One UST can always be exchanged for a floating quantity of Luna with a market value of $1…. On first principles this is insane…. If Luna trades at $0.01, you can print 10 million of them and buy 100,000 Terra and push the price up. But if Luna trades at $0.00… it cannot be used to support the price of Terra. And because you just made it up, there is no particular reason for [Luna] to be worth anything, so there is no particular reason for [Terra] to be worth a dollar…. </p><p>Nonetheless! It works?… Terraform Labs… pays 19.5% promotional interest on UST deposits. People want a stablecoin that is worth a dollar, so they are inclined to treat Terra as though it’s worth a dollar, which makes it worth a dollar. They buy lots of Luna to turn into Terra, which means that the price of Luna goes up, which means that there is plenty of valuable Luna to support the price of Terra, which means that Terra is robustly worth a dollar. Ha, well, oops…. A bank run&nbsp;is a fairly mild event compared to a death spiral….</p><p>Meanwhile, the mechanism that LFG is using to defend the peg is interesting. It has&nbsp;<em><strong>loaned</strong>&nbsp;</em>Bitcoin&nbsp;to market makers to use to protect the UST peg to the dollar…. This means that… market makers… [are] selling Bitcoin to buy UST…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a

does not carry a coupon, so why shouldn't we be able to issue things that do not carry a coupon and still hold value? The standard response is that central bank-issued cash carries value not by the "fiat" of the central bank, but because they serve as anticipatory tax receipts. You can show them to the tax authority, which takes them, and lo and behold! Your assets are not confiscated by the Treasury!</p><p>And gold? Gold is a special case: time-honored. Devotees of BTC say that they are the first mover into this space, and so they are time-honored too. They also say that there are lots of places and times in the world where you want your wealth to be at least somewhat hidden, and—even though most people’s BTC is very visible to the authorities

My hope is that a cease-fire accompanied by some Russian withdrawal could be at the heart of a P steel, with Putin allowed to declare victory via international recognition of the reversal of the 1950s transfer of Crimea from Russia to Ukraine, and with a Marshall Plan and security guarantees making that pill not too bitter for Ukraine to swallow. The problem is that Ukraine got its security guarantees in 2004, and they turned out to be completely worthless:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Barry Eichengreen</strong>: <em>Shaping a Marshall Plan for Ukraine</em>: ‘Aid to Ukraine can start now, though it should be used with discretion. Repairing bridges that are simply destroyed again by Russia would serve no purpose…. Recall that Marshall Plan funds were more than 90% grants and just 10% loans…. The US created an independent agency to administer the Marshall Plan…. It was able to tap private-sector expertise, starting with its head, Paul Hoffman, the president of Studebaker. It avoided entanglements…. Aid for Ukraine should similarly be administered by an autonomous agency accountable to donor governments…. The Marshall Plan’s architects recognized the need for ownership on the part of aid recipients, while proceeding on the basis of “trust but verify.” European governments submitted detailed plans for spending down US funds. These were the bases for painstaking negotiations…. Administrative reforms were a focus and precondition…. The Marshall Plan prioritized rebuilding export capacity…. Finally, the Marshall Plan allowed Europe to leapfrog a generation technologically. Europe was decades behind the US in adopting the “high-speed throughput” manufacturing methods on which the golden age of postwar economic growth was based…. Ukraine now similarly has an opportunity to leapfrog…. These are first and foremost tasks for the Ukrainians. But the West can and should help…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/shaping-marshall-plan-for-ukraine-by-barry-eichengreen-2022-05">https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/shaping-marshall-plan-for-ukraine-by-barry-eichengreen-2022-05</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p></p><div><hr></div><p>Zero-profit companies are by definition extremely long-duration assets and so extremely sensitive to the discount rate. It is not clear to me that what is going on as well-described as a shift in sentiment rather than simply as a consequence of duration. But Josh Brown’s prose is very fun:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Joshua M. Brown</strong>: <em>Attitude Adjustment</em>: ‘Market capitalizations vanishing…. PayPal… from $300 billion to $80 billion in just a matter of months. Netflix… from 700 dollars per share to under 200…. Cathie Wood’s flagship fund loses 70% of its value…. Small cap biotech down 60%…. Gene therapy is not even remotely economically cyclical. Doesn’t matter. It’s not the fundamentals, it’s the sentiment…. Boundless growth, total addressable market, venture-backed, innovative, groundbreaking, web3, transformational, disruptive… now completely out of the question…. Cashflow is in, imagination is out…. The unicorns are being gelded, reins pulled in, their horns knocked off with a croquet mallet. <em><strong>F— you, I’m not valuing you at a multiple of how many people there are in the world who might give you 8 dollars a month in the year 2027.</strong></em>… If you think Tiger Global, down 52% year-to-date, is still going to be writing checks at the same velocity as they had been just a year ago, you’re going to be disappointed.

Yes, “globalization” was a convenient scapegoat for the things that went wrong for the non-élite. But it was just a scapegoat, not a cause. Hence I interpret this as Dani Rodrik calling for a return to hyperglobalization, but this time with sane social democratic domestic politics:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Dani Rodrik</strong>: <em>A Better Globalization Might Rise from Hyper-Globalization’s Ashes</em>: ‘The share of trade in world GDP began to decline after 2007, as China’s export-to-GDP ratio plummeted by a remarkable 16 percentage points. Global value chains stopped spreading. International capital flows never recovered to their pre–2007 heights. And populist politicians openly hostile to globalization became much more influential…. With hyper-globalization having collapsed, scenarios for the world economy run the gamut. The worst outcome, recalling the 1930s, would be withdrawal by countries (or groups of countries) into autarky. A less bad, but still ugly, possibility is that the supremacy of geopolitics means that trade wars and economic sanctions become a permanent feature…. The first step is for policymakers to… reviv[e]… the spirit of the Bretton Woods era, when the global economy served domestic economic and social goals…. A second important prerequisite for the good scenario is that countries do not turn a legitimate quest for national security into aggression against others…. Our future world need not be one where geopolitics trumps everything else and countries (or regional blocs) minimize their economic interactions with one another. If that dystopian scenario does materialize… it will be because we made the wrong choices…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/after-hyperglobalization-national-interests-open-economy-by-dani-rodrik-2022-05">https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/after-hyperglobalization-national-interests-open-economy-by-dani-rodrik-2022-05</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p></p><div><hr></div><p>Not sure what I think about this. Putin is not rational, but Putin is a cat that has just sat on a hot stove. And the production gap between NATO and Russia is much larger than the gap between Germany and Russia was during World War II—rope-a-dope is not a feasible strategy:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Michael Shurkin</strong>: <em>’The Russian military’s shabby performance</em> should not be taken as proof that Europe and the US need not worry about Russia, or that Finland and Sweden need not question their “neutrality.” Why not? First, Russia, for all its operational failings, retains the capacity to wreak extraordinary amounts of damage and pain upon its neighbors. It could still flatten Kyiv, if it wanted to, and that’s w/o resorting to nukes. So, Finland for example, could cut the Russian army to pieces, but still would have to endure extraordinary hardship and horror. Second, NATO more generally would also cut the Russians to pieces, until day 3, when NATO armies run out of ammunition. Russia can still prevail by playing “rope a dope,” i.e. absorbing destruction while staying in the fight. That was more or less Russian strategy in WW2. Third, Russians are more than capable of learning and improving. There’s zero reason to assume that the next time Russia invades a country, it will do so with the same level of ineptitude. Russians ARE NOT stupid. Fourth, and most importantly: The Russian invasion proves (as if it wasn’t already clear) Putin’s willingness to eschew int’l norms and use military force in a war of aggression. Meaning that whatever we may think of how well anyone’s army might do against Russia, the point is that another war against one of Russia’s neighbors is not implausible.

Can anything be done about this?… Users should have to verify their identity before they can share content and have their content shared.
