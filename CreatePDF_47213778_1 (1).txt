Oil prices do what they do. Meat-processing and such became much more dangerous occupations, 
without becoming more highly paid, during the plague. Moter vehiclesa€l as I see it, the producers 
(save Elon Musk) decided that they would cartelize by accepting their chip allocations, rather than 
bid for more chips. A clear place, IMHO, where antitrust policy would more likely than not have
made some difference for inflation.

I look at this graph, and I still find myself on Team Transitory and Team The-Fed-Has-Got-Ita€!

The Incision

The omicron paradox.

If you were to chart, by country, the number of confirmed CO VID deaths per million on one axis and 
GDP per capita on the other (below), there is no other country with as high a GDP with as many 
deaths; America has, pound for pound, fared worse throughout this pandemic than any other country 
on Earth. This is particularly astounding considering the wealth of our country, the fact that most
of the worlda€™ s public health infrastructure was modeled off of ours, and that we spend nearly a 
fifth of our entire economy on healthcarea€!

Paragraphs:

Bret Devereaux: Rome: Decline and Fall? Part I: Words: a€~At the same time, writers in the fifth, 
sixth and seventh centuries did not stop writing (or stop reading). Much of the literature of this 
period was religious in nature, but that is no reason to dismiss it (far more of the literature of 
the Classical world was religious in nature than you likely think, by the by). St. Augustine of 
Hippo was
writing during the fifth century; indeed his The City of God, one of the foundational works of 
Christian literature, was written in response to the news of the sack of Rome in 410. Isidore of 
Seville (560a€“636) was famous for his Etymologies, an encyclopedia of sorts which would form the 
foundation for much of medieval learning and which in its summaries preserves for us quite a lot of
classical bits and bobs which would have otherwise been lost; he also invented the period, comma 
and colon. Pope Gregory I (540a€“604) was also a prolific writer, writing hundreds of letters, a 
collection of four books of dialogues, a life of St. Benedict, a book on the role of bishops, a 
commentary on the Book of Job and so on. The Rule of St. Benedict, since wea€™ ve brought the 
fellow up,
written in 516 established the foundation for western monasticisma€!

Here's what I mean when I say Biden should 'focus on the economy'

As I told Politico this week, I am still rooting for the president. I complain because I want him 
to be more successful and more popular, and I believe a better rhetorical and substantive approach 
to the economy and especially inflation is the number one thing he needs to improve his positiona€!

The a€~nut a€~graph:

Our greatness and grandeur will be found in the faithful application of the principle of perfect 
civil equalitya€!. Gathered here, from all quarters of the globe by a common aspiration for 
rational liberty as against caste, divine right governments and privileged classesa€! it would be 
madness to set up any one race above another, or one religion above another, or proscribe
any on account of race color or creeda€!. Though they come as the waves come, we shall be stronger 
if we receive them as friends and give them a reason for loving our country and our 
institutionsa€!. The points of human difference, great as they, upon first sight, seem, are as 
nothing compared with the points of human agreement. Such contact would remove mountains
of prejudiced!. The voice of civilization speaks an unmistakable language against the isolation of 
families, nations and races, and pleads for composite nationality as essential to her triumphs a€ I

This is a perfect example of what I call the Massachusetts strain of American nationalism.

Another example is to be found in George Kennana€™ s article on The Sources of Soviet Conduct:

The possibilities for American policy are by no means limited to holding the line and hoping for 
the besta€!. It is rather a question of the degree to which the United States can create among the 
peoples of the world generally the impression of a country which knows what it wants, which is 
coping successfully with the problems of its internal life and with the
responsibilities of a World Power, and which has a spiritual vitality capable of holding its own 
among the major ideological currents of the timed!. The palsied decrepitude of the capitalist world 
is the keystone of Communist philosophyd!. Exhibitions of indecision, disunity and in- ternal 
disintegration within this country have an exhilarating effect on the whole
Communist movementd!.

Thus the decision will really fall in large measure in this country itself. The issue of 
Soviet-American relations is in essence a test of the over-all worth of the United States as a 
nation among nations. To avoid destruction the United States need only measure up to its own best 
traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation. Surely, there was never a
fairer test of national quality than thisd!. The thoughtful observerd! will find no cause for 
complaint in the Kremlin's challenge to American society. He will rather experience a certain 
gratitude to a Providence which, by providing the American people with this implacable challenge, 
has made their entire security as a nation dependent on their pulling themselves
together and accepting the responsibilities of moral and political leadership that history plainly 
intended them to bear.
