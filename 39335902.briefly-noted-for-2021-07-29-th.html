Those who know Jeff are aware that he seems to make important contributions to the economic history of virtually everywhere and ‘everywhen’. However, perhaps his most lasting and important research contributions have involved expanding the scope of economic history in terms of both methodology and geographic area….&nbsp;</p><p>It is Jeff’s contributions to the broad remit of this&nbsp;<em>Journal</em>&nbsp;that are emphasised in this issue. Jeff has worked on Asian economic history since the 1960s… ‘Writing History Backwards: Meiji Japan Revisited’ (with Allen Kelley)… visiting ANU and Melbourne… being actively involved with the&nbsp;<em>Journal</em>&nbsp;and Society over this time period. He has contributed more papers to the&nbsp;<em>AEHR</em>&nbsp;than anyone else who has never held a full-time position in an Australian university and been on the editorial board of the Journal since 2003…. The papers in this issue are all written by Jeff’s collaborators and former PhD students and are on topics adjacent to earlier work with Jeff.

Indeed the market creed of the Manchester Liberals may be called the hereditary enemy of the House of Polanyi. All Polanyis searched for another alternative, whether [cousin Odon Pol’s] early fascism, Adolph’s romantic Brazil, [Laura] Mousie’s “rural sociology,” Michael’s stoic desire-free individual, or Karl’s “social principles of economic integration.” But the more Karl delved into prehistory, primitive economics, and classical antiquity, the more proof did he find for the hated and despised market creed of Ricardo and Bentham, and also of Karl’s contemporary bogeymen, Ludwig von Mises and Frederick Hayek of the Austrian School. So Karl retreated into footnotes, into more and more anthropological studies, and into academic busyness…. It was my willingness in&nbsp;<em>The Future of Industrial Man</em>&nbsp;to settle instead for an adequate, bearable, but free society that Karl at the time criticized and rejected as a tepid compromise…. But just as the failure of a whole generation of brilliant thinkers to find the… new synthesis between Catholicism and Protestantism… foreshadowed the end of the Age of Infallible Religion fifty years later, so the failure of the brilliant Polanyis to find the alternative beyond capitalism and communism might well foreshadow the end of the Age of the Infallible Society…</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Ed Rampell</strong>&nbsp;(2013):&nbsp;<em>An Interview with Richard Wolff</em>: ‘[Richard Wolff:] Many companies, including famous names like Apple computers, if you go back and look at the early days you may be surprised to find out that they were co-ops. The original founders were often workers dissatisfied by being mere employees in somebody’s company, so they got together with others, often at young ages, and pooled their enthusiasm and energy and setup a different kind of enterprise. Very common in Silicon Valley. Every year, hundreds, in some years thousands, of engineers quit their jobs in big companies like IBM, Oracle or Cisco, and get together with friends and say, “okay, we want to start a different kind of business. We’re all going to take our laptops and gather at Harry’s garage, and here’s what we want: We don’t want to come to work every day in a suit and tie or for some executive who doesn’t understand anything about computers telling us what to do. We don’t want any of the rigmarole; it’s stifling, it kills our creativity. We’d like to go to a place where there are no bosses, where we’re all equal. Where we can wear Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts and bring our toddlers.” And that’s what they’ve done. And in many cases they’ve been very strict: All decisions have to be made by consensus.

Last</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Damnation of George P. Bush</em>: ‘George P. Bush leaned into this entire affair so hard that he sold merch boasting about the betrayal of his family…. This is from June. Six months after the January insurrection. What did this abasement and betrayal get George P.? A fat load of jack squat. Surely George P. wasn’t foolish enough to think that Trump would go so far as to endorse him. But he probably hoped that, by toadying as shamelessly as possible, he might keep Trump on the sidelines and out of endorsing in the race. At the least, he must have hoped that Trump wouldn’t weigh in until much later in the race, when, if George P. had good poll numbers, maybe Trump would be nervous about endorsing someone else. But you must understand that this election, the Republican primary, isn’t until May 1, 2022. It’s more than nine months away. Trump endorsing this early effectively puts an end to the race. It freezes all of the party establishment and money in place, because now to be for George P. is to be against Trump. Ain’t no Texas Republicans fixin’ to do that there foolishness…. A great many Republicans still believe that if they just get along, they’ll go along. That if they keep their heads down, or truckle under, they can keep running their game. That so long as they’re not like those icky Never Trumpers, the revolution won’t come for them. To go against Trumpism is to court defeat. To abase yourself before it is to add dishonor to the bargain. The funny part—and really, this is the single weirdest irony of our entire nationalist odyssey—is that Trump frequently ended his rallies by reading “The Snake.” Donald Trump literally told the Republican party who he was and what he would do to them. It was not subtext. It was the actual text. He read it from a paper. Over and over again. Most of the party, it turned out, wanted a snake. They embraced the nihilism because it promised a chance to hurt their enemies. But men like George P. Bush refused to believe—even at this late date—that the story could possibly be true. Let his shame be a reminder, a warning, and a lesson…&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://thebulwark.com/the-damnation-of-george-p-bush/">https://thebulwark.com/the-damnation-of-george-p-bush/</a>&gt;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p><strong>Diane Lim</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Will the Infrastructure Bill Fail to Create Jobs Where We Most Need Them?</em>: ‘Two months.

That February to April 2020 “peak to trough” is the shortest recession the NBER has ever recorded (going back to the mid–1800s), and also means we have been back in economic recovery mode for 15 months now!… Policies focus on an economic recovery strategy as the COVID–19 public health crisis has mostly been beaten back where vaccine rollout has been adopted.
