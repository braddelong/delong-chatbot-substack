And even within that period, there are two sub-periods that stand out: 1666-1720 and 1820-1870…. Here's how I interpret this: Nothing unique happened in 1870. Great Britain was just following its normal growth path…. In the 17th century this produced GDP high enough to support a growing urban craft class but did little for ordinary workers. By the late 19th century GDP finally reached a point where (a) workers started demanding a bigger share of the pie and (b) capitalists were rich enough that they could afford to meet workers' demands without any real hardship. In any exponential growth curve there's always a knee in the curve where it suddenly seems like things have changed…</p></blockquote><p>Let me raise three points:</p><p>1/ His claim “nothing unique happened in 1870” is wrong, for as he says later on “in any exponential growth curve there’s always a knee in the curve”. </p><p>Whether there was something unique happening in 1870 with respect to the causes and course of growth is something we can and will argue about. </p><p>But there is no doubt that there was something unique happening in 1870 with respect to the <em><strong>consequences</strong></em> of growth. Before 1870 there was no chance that humanity could bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to potentially have <em><strong>enough</strong></em>, with all the downstream effects that impossibility entails. After 1870 the day of baking a sufficiently large economic pie was visible and rapidly coming closer, with all the opportunities that possibility entails. And that is what my book is about—consequences much more than causes.</p><p>2/ Kevin’s claim that British economic growth since 1450 is well-enough modeled by a constant exponential growth curve with an average annual growth rate of 1.8%/year does not seem to me to be right either. I look at the same numbers for real income per capita in Britain that Kevin looks at, and I see:</p><h2>Estimated British Real Income Growth</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e99f823-a32f-4284-af9e-edf06e67b37d_490x456.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e99f823-a32f-4284-af9e-edf06e67b37d_490x456.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e99f823-a32f-4284-af9e-edf06e67b37d_490x456.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e99f823-a32f-4284-af9e-edf06e67b37d_490x456.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e99f823-a32f-4284-af9e-edf06e67b37d_490x456.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6e99f823-a32f-4284-af9e-edf06e67b37d_490x456.png" width="490" height="456" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6e99f823-a32f-4284-af9e-edf06e67b37d_490x456.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:456,&quot;width&quot;:490,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:49902,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e99f823-a32f-4284-af9e-edf06e67b37d_490x456.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e99f823-a32f-4284-af9e-edf06e67b37d_490x456.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e99f823-a32f-4284-af9e-edf06e67b37d_490x456.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e99f823-a32f-4284-af9e-edf06e67b37d_490x456.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There is nothing going on in terms of income growth before 1650. Then there is a surge in the second half of the 1600s—one that comes too early to attribute to the effects of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and that I attribute to the agricultural and the imperial-commercial revolutions. But that is an unsustainable “efflorescence”, rather than a shift to a new growth régime. In Britain, the permanent upward shift in the growth rate comes around 1830, with deviations thereafter as Britain loses its paramount industrial supremacy over 1870-1914, with the Age of Chaos from 1914-1950, and then recovery of lost ground from 1950-1980. </p><p>So why not start my “Long 20th Century” in 1830? One consideration is that the jump-up in British real wages is much closer to 1870 than 1830. But the big reason is that Britain is only a small part of what I am looking at. The big reason is that Britain was the leading technological edge of the integrated economy of the Dover Circle—plus their settler colonies—for a relatively short time, from roughly 1700-1870. It is the Dover Circle economy that I think matters. And it is the world that matters more.</p><p>3/ Most important, however: the growth acceleration for the bulk of the world economy—rather than just the small technological leader of it takes place around 1870.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/a-comment-on-kevin-drums-technical?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/a-comment-on-kevin-drums-technical?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/a-comment-on-kevin-drums-technical/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/a-comment-on-kevin-drums-technical/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div class="install-substack-app-embed"><img class="install-substack-app-embed-img" src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png"><div class="install-substack-app-embed-text"><div class="install-substack-app-header">Read Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality in the Substack app</div><div class="install-substack-app-text">Available for iOS and Android</div></div><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_context=author-post-insert" target="_blank" class="install-substack-app-embed-link"><button class="install-substack-app-embed-btn button primary">Get the app</button></a></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>
