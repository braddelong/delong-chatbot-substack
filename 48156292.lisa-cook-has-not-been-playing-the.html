of Governors this morning. And there have not been nearly enough positive validators. A fair and meritocratic selection process would have thrown up a lot more Black Fed Governors by now. But there are complaints—and they, I think, all boil down to “unlike we white guys, she hasn’t been playing the Game of Life on the ‘easiest’ setting &lt;<a href="https://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/">https://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/</a>&gt;, and so hasn’t piled up as many of the points <em>I</em> care about as I have…”</p><p>Pretty stupid. Pretty much completely in bad faith. And a bunch of people who know, or ought to know, how smart and thoughtful Lisa is are not out there validating her nomination.

Where is the unskilled-labor representing governor? Finance, wealth, technocratic economists and small business [owners] are almost the only people who have ever gotten a voice”…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lisa-cook-federal-reserve-nominee-racist-criticism_n_61f367eee4b02de5f516fa2a">https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lisa-cook-federal-reserve-nominee-racist-criticism_n_61f367eee4b02de5f516fa2a</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>And I wrote to the <em>Daily Caller</em>:</p><p>The five Biden Fed appointments and reappointments—Powell as Chair, Brainard as Vice-Chair, Bloom Raskin as Vice-Chair for Supervision, Cook and Jefferson to the Board—strike me as a near perfect portfolio of central-banker appointments. (The only big improvement I could see would come from switching Brainard and Powell, who do make a good team, but I don't see why Lael should always be playing second fiddle here.) The Amended Federal Reserve Act charges the President, in choosing the members of the Board of Governors, to "have due regard to a fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and com­mercial interests, and geographical divisions of the country..." These are all five extremely high-quality and hard-working people with a very strong sense of public service, and together they have the comprehensive set of perspectives that the Amended Federal Reserve Act directs the President to provide in his appointment—a comprehensive set of perspectives that has been greatly lacking in the appointments of past presidents who have felt free to disregard the legislative language of the "representation" clauses of the Amended Federal Reserve Act.</p><div><hr></div><p>&amp; Paul Romer:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Paul Romer</strong>: <em>Theories, Facts, and Lisa Cook</em>: ‘I proposed a theory…. In a paper available here or here, Lisa presents evidence… about a crucial point that this line of reasoning [of mine] missed. She used patenting as a proxy for the activities that spur growth and assembled convincing evidence that there is another part of the legal system that has a bigger effect: the degree to which it creates a climate of personal security by protecting citizens from the threat of violence…. The gist of Lisa’s paper is conveyed in two figures. The first presents patenting rates for black inventors and the control group, white inventors…. The second shows the timing of violence against Blacks during these years. The surprise for me was the size of the effect on black patenting at a time when the control group of white inventors shows no comparable change. Had I considered the effect that changes in personal security can have on an activity like patenting, I might have concluded that it could have some effect, but I would not have expected the effect to be so large. After Lisa’s evidence forced me to think again about how easy it is to take personal security for granted and about the profound effect that a lack of personal security can have on optimism and a willingness to invest in the future…. Growth theorists could learn a lot by looking beyond the degree to which a system of law provides protection for contracts and intellectual property rights and evaluating the degree to which it creates a climate of personal security….</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F583bd2dd-d6dd-4a6d-b875-eeb4684c1b1b_1564x526.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F583bd2dd-d6dd-4a6d-b875-eeb4684c1b1b_1564x526.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F583bd2dd-d6dd-4a6d-b875-eeb4684c1b1b_1564x526.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F583bd2dd-d6dd-4a6d-b875-eeb4684c1b1b_1564x526.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F583bd2dd-d6dd-4a6d-b875-eeb4684c1b1b_1564x526.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/583bd2dd-d6dd-4a6d-b875-eeb4684c1b1b_1564x526.png" width="1456" height="490" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/583bd2dd-d6dd-4a6d-b875-eeb4684c1b1b_1564x526.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:490,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:235913,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F583bd2dd-d6dd-4a6d-b875-eeb4684c1b1b_1564x526.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F583bd2dd-d6dd-4a6d-b875-eeb4684c1b1b_1564x526.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F583bd2dd-d6dd-4a6d-b875-eeb4684c1b1b_1564x526.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F583bd2dd-d6dd-4a6d-b875-eeb4684c1b1b_1564x526.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>[We] should prefer having someone like Lisa on the Board of Governors over someone like me because she will insist doggedly that important decisions be based on facts rather than theories.
