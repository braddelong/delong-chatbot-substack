Then it was Japan and the Four Tigers that had the secret sauce. But now we have added coastal China; Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand; and—perhaps—Indonesia. It is region-wide, in spite of substantial differences in policies and starting points, with the Philippines being the very odd creature out in the region. This should give us pause, and should give us many clues as to what is essential and what is accidental in the full-convergence process:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Noah Smith</strong>:&nbsp;<em>What Studwell Got Wrong</em>: ‘My favorite book about economic development is Joe Studwell’s&nbsp;<em>How Asia Works</em>. If you haven’t read this book, you should definitely remedy that. In the meantime, you can start with Scott Alexander’s excellent summary….&nbsp;<em>How Asia Works</em>… tells a coherent story about how countries get rich…. Land reform: Forcibly buy up tenant farms from landlords and give it to the tenants…. Export discipline: Push companies to export instead of just selling domestically. Cut off support to companies that try to export and fail…. Financial control: Push banks to support exporters instead of putting their money into real estate bubbles and the like…. Because it’s so hard to test, the theory serves less as a tried-and-true policy prescription and more as a launching point for ideas about how to manage a developing economy…. Studwell does make a few mistakes…. The time and effort that Studwell puts into coming up with reasons why South Korea has done a bit better than Taiwan is probably wasted; South Korea simply has a slightly more expensive currency…. Studwell’s biggest mistake, however, is writing off Malaysia…..&nbsp;<em>How Asia Works</em>&nbsp;may have made a more general mistake by focusing only on failures when it came to Southeast Asian countries and contrasting these with successes in Northeast Asian countries.…&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/what-studwell-got-wrong">https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/what-studwell-got-wrong</a>&gt;</p></blockquote></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-28-we?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-28-we?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Neil Lowenthal</strong>:&nbsp;<em>’PHYSICS 101</em>&nbsp;Newton’s first law… From Pascal Bournet &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/NeilLowenthal1/status/1408168056149274624">https://twitter.com/NeilLowenthal1/status/1408168056149274624</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Wikipedia</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Wei River</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_River">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_River</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>John Stoehr</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Country Is Failing to Face the Rage of Donald Trump’s Supporters.

A successful strategy will have four main components…. Competitive market conditions must prevail throughout the industry, because excessive market power in any one segment can jeopardize supply. The system must also be resilient to shocks like fires, droughts, earthquakes, and geopolitical tensions and upheavals. And it must be secure in two senses: the US must maintain reliable access to cutting-edge chips and the means of producing them, and chip supplies need to be protected from threats like counterfeiting, theft, cyberattacks, and espionage. Finally, the supply must be sustainable, accounting&nbsp;for the significant environmental and energy costs of chip production. CRSS does not mean national autonomy in the semiconductor industry. That goal would be neither feasible nor economically rational…. What CRSS does mean is that the US should cooperate closely with the European Union, Japan, Singapore, Israel, and others who form core parts of its secure supply base. CRSS also does not mean preventing China from purchasing or selling semiconductors on global markets, or from developing its own semiconductor industry in ways that do not violate global trade and investment rules. Weaponizing trade and investment restrictions to thwart China’s long-run semiconductor ambitions will be costly and counterproductive…. There is a danger that generous fiscal support will end up subsidizing private investments that are already being planned…. Both basic and pre-competitive research in semiconductors is an increasingly borderless process, which means that the effectiveness of US outlays will depend on cooperation with allies and participation by their companies…. Finally… US… ability to prototype and scale innovations has been hampered by the “lab-to-fab valley of death.” Breakthrough projects that may be viable in research labs are often prohibitively expensive to demonstrate, leaving them starved of the private investment needed to achieve scale. A promising approach to address this problem is a pre-competitive public-private R&amp;D partnership…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-semiconductor-strategy-by-laura-tyson-and-john-zysman-2021-07">https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-semiconductor-strategy-by-laura-tyson-and-john-zysman-2021-07</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Timothy Burke</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Futures of Crime and Punishment (Part V)</em>: ‘The question of why people might oppose a better future is the political problem that matters.
