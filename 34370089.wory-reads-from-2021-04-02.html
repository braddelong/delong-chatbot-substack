The Latinx unemployment rate decreased to 7.9 percent in March from 8.5 percent in February. Employment growth in March was led by leisure and hospitality and education services as in-person activity was able to resume alongside a notable increase in construction.

But we did. Abandon it, that is. Now I very much hope that it is coming back:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Equitable Growth</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Child Allowance Will Pay Dividends for the Entire U.S. Economy Far into the Future</em>: ‘One feature of the newly enacted American Rescue Plan that got less attention in the lead up to its passage than the more headline-grabbing $1,400 economic impact payments are the reforms to the Child Tax Credit. The legislation dramatically expands and improves the CTC, making it fully refundable and increasing its value to as much as $300 per child per month.

Efficiency-wage theories tell us that, in the context of the production network, workers are essentially paid their hold-up values—whatever it takes to incentivize them not to “shirk”. Employer-monopsony theories tell us that Labor supply curves are almost always substantially elastic, it's only because the local knowledge of how to manage the boss and which of your fellow workers’ company you would enjoy at lunch is a valuable source of utility and is something that you forgo if you change jobs. And yet elegant theoretical and empirical demonstration of the importance of these factors have had very little effect on how many neoclassical and neoliberal economist think about the labor market. Perhaps it is because sociologists and others tend to phrase these issues in terms of “power”. And, for economists, “power” is a meaningless noise—there are only factors that restrict the choice set, and exercise of choice within those constraints. Don Corleone in <em>The Godfather</em> does not exercise power. He merely makes you an offer—one that the constraint set, it is true, makes it one that you cannot refuse:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Equitable Growth</strong>:&nbsp;<em>In Conversation with Jake Rosenfeld</em>: ‘Equitable Growth Director of Labor Market Policy Kate Bahn talks with Jake Rosenfeld, a professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis, where he studies the causes of economic inequality in the United States and other postindustrial economies, particularly the determinants of wages and salaries and how these vary across time and place. His most recent book,&nbsp;<em>You’re Paid What You’re Worth and Other Myths of the Modern Economy</em>&nbsp;(Harvard University Press, 2021), challenges the idea that workers are paid according to individual performance or inherent features of their jobs, and places power and social conflict at the heart of economic analysis….

(2) When you look at China in the coastal East Asian context, it does not look like it has any extra remarkable special sauce for market-entrepreneurial and  export-oriented growth in its coastal East Asian context. (3) Chinese land policy, specifically the slowdown of the great migration to the coast, appears to have been a substantial retardation of what could have been a much more rapid rate of economic growth and catch-up for China. (4) Barry Eichengreen is an extremely wise man, and I should pay even more attention to him than I do given that he's only three offices away.

ability to pick what wages they pay, and in which workers are paid their “marginal products”. There is a chunk of the economy in which employers have market power to pick what wages they pay—via various policies of “managing turnover”—and in which employers maximize profits by cutting low-wage employment below the level at which the marginal worker’s product equals the wage. In the first chunk, an increase in the minimum wage reduces employment (but almost surely increases total wages paid to low-wage workers). In the second chunk, an increase in the minimum wage moves the low-wage labor market toward its competitive equilibrium and so raises employment. We have no good reason to believe that either of these sectors is, today, much larger than the other: no good reason to believe that increases in the minimum wage in the range up to $15/hour will have a big effect either way on employment.</p><p>That’s what a good-faith look at the evidence tells us. The claim that the fact that people taking a good-faith look at the evidence are not impressed by the CBO’s minimum wage study tells us that “hypocrisy is bipartisan” is simply false. As Arindrajit Dube writes &lt;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/24/minimum-wage-economic-research-job-loss/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/24/minimum-wage-economic-research-job-loss/</a>&gt;: CBO’s “report examines only 11 studies…. Its sources include the first University of Washington study but not the follow-up that came to a more positive conclusion… changed its formula for summarizing the literature since… 2019…. Then, it looked at the median…. This time, it placed more weight on those that found large job losses. The 2019 report was already somewhat out of step with the latest academic research, but the new one is even more so…” Cherry-picking the studies you look at, and then changing the way you average them on the fly—anyone operating in good faith has to be extremely skeptical of any such document:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tyler Cowen</strong>:&nbsp;<em>When It Comes to the CBO, the Hypocrisy Is Bipartisan</em>: ‘Earlier this year the CBO said that a federal $15 minimum wage would eliminate 1.4 million jobs…. Many academics also did not side with the CBO. Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts, a self-described social democrat, argued against the CBO interpretation of the research literature and suggested the loss of employment would be much lower. My own view is closer to that of the CBO. But my larger point is contextual: It is not obvious whether Dube or the CBO is right or wrong. A person operating in good faith can look at the evidence and take either side of the argument… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-31/when-it-comes-to-the-cbo-the-hypocrisy-is-bipartisan">https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-31/when-it-comes-to-the-cbo-the-hypocrisy-is-bipartisan</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>2) When the moderate Republicans decided to follow Newt Gingrich in 1993 and go quiet as he led the right-wing choir into his version of the crazy—from Hillary Rodham Clinton as anti-American feminist to Bill Clinton as Russian spy to Vince Foster killed to silence Clinton scandals—they thought it was a tactical move that would seat them in the chairs of power, after which they could bring things back to normal. They failed to recognize that when they addict their base to the crazy they are always subject to being out-crazied. Some of those who followed Gingrich have had second thoughts since: John Kasich, for example. Others—like former Speaker John Boehner—still have no clue how they pwned themselves, and have come close to wrecking the country in the process:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Charles Sykes</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Popcorn &amp; Cabernet</em>: ‘Former Speaker John Boehner is out with a new book and, apparently, it does not disappoint. Politico has an excerpt: Boehner describes a meeting with Fox New boss Roger Ailes. "And it was clear that he believed all of this crazy stuff. I walked out of that meeting in a daze. I just didn’t believe the entire federal government was so terrified of Roger Ailes that they’d break about a dozen laws to bring him down. I thought I could get him to control the crazies, and instead I found myself talking to the president of the club. One of us was crazy. Maybe it was me…. Under the new rules of Crazytown, I may have been Speaker, but I didn’t hold all the power. By 2013 the chaos caucus in the House had built up their own power base thanks to fawning right-wing media and outrage-driven fundraising cash. And now they had a new head lunatic leading the way, who wasn’t even a House member. There is nothing more dangerous than a reckless asshole who thinks he is smarter than everyone else. Ladies and gentlemen, meet Senator Ted Cruz. He enlisted the crazy caucus of the GOP in what was a truly dumbass idea.

That is what I think one of the long-run results of the COVID-19 plague will be. And there is definitely a possibility that the social learning undertaken under the shadow of the grim reaper will turn out to raise productivity by a non-trivial amount—if we recognize the inadequacies of our statistics:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Jose Maria Barrero, Nicholas Bloom, &amp; Steven J. Davis</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Why Working From Home Will Stick</em>: ‘Our data say that 20 percent of full workdays will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends, compared with just 5 percent before…. Better-than-expected WFH experiences, new investments… greatly diminished stigma… long-lingering concerns about crowds and contagion… a pandemic-driven surge in technological innovations that support WFH…. High-income workers, especially, will enjoy large benefits…. The shift… will directly reduce spending in major city centers by 5–10…. A 6 percent productivity boost in the post-pandemic economy due to re-optimized working arrangements.

Importantly, this was found to be the case even for the most recent ambitious policies. Therefore, it concludes that, based on the overall weight of the available evidence, there is room for exploring a more ambitious NLW remit in the UK in the coming years, in the range of 60% to two-thirds of median hourly earnings. However, given that the evidence base is still developing, it would also be prudent to accompany more ambitious minimum wages with a clear mandate that the Low Pay Commission (LPC) can use to implement, evaluate and recalibrate any proposed changes to the NLW, thereby designing in responsiveness to any unforeseen impacts if required… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/844350/impacts_of_minimum_wages_review_of_the_international_evidence_Arindrajit_Dube_web.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/844350/impacts_of_minimum_wages_review_of_the_international_evidence_Arindrajit_Dube_web.pdf</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>6) Here Joshua Gans agrees with me. It is much better for people with things to say to be on SubStack, rather than working as sideshow acts for advertisers. SubStack and company look, to me, like a substantial intellectual win. But will the Gods of the Marketplace be tolerant enough for it to be self-sustainable?:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Joshua Gans</strong>:&nbsp;<em>’I have noticed</em>&nbsp;that the journalists/opinion writers who have migrated to Substack are writing better pieces than they have in years. They are up in terms of length, reading age-level and complexity of arguments. I think this is a consequence of the change in underlying business model. When you sell ads, you need views. That means you want a product that attracts the marginal customer. When you sell subscriptions, that may seem to also hold but it doesn’t. That’s because a subscription is not a payment for an individual unit but instead a payment for a bundle. To keep people subscribed to the bundle, people have to be attracted to the average rather than the marginal attracting people. That, combined with the lack of an intermediary, means that the scale of a substack is much lower and more niche than ad-based outlets. Hence, for people I consumed even when they were edited/commercialised, I am happier now when they are not. For others, I can’t tell (yet)…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/joshgans/status/1377242922236719105">https://twitter.com/joshgans/status/1377242922236719105</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>7) Twitter’s failure to properly curb its Nazis, plus its tolerance for people of power and influence who violate its terms of service—this has, I think, wrecked the usefulness of the platform for society as a whole. Yes, if you prune your feed properly, you can get a great deal out of it. But most people won’t use their slow-thinking-brain to do the work. And twitter is poisonous if you let your fast-reacting-brain curate your feed. Facebook and Youtube are worse: too much of their business model involves glueing you to the screen by scaring you so that you can be grifted. Now it is SubStack’s turn in the barrel: trying to figure out how to make money without, you know, doing evil. We wish them luck:</p><blockquote><p><strong>SubStack</strong>:&nbsp;<em>How We Approach Moderation Decisions</em>: ‘We do not allow spam or phishing…. We do not allow harassment or threats….

And people should check what they write to make themselves as sure as they can that they are writing true things. And people who make a pattern of writing, knowingly or carelessly, false things should be ignored. Sticking to these three principles would make the public sphere much better. Yes, we are looking at you, Jude Doyle: </p><blockquote><p><strong>Matt Yglesias</strong>: <em>Weekend Update, March 20</em>: ‘Along the way Jude Doyle named me as one of several “people who actively hate trans people and women, argue ceaselessly against our civil rights, and in many cases, have a public history of directly, viciously abusing trans people and/or cis women in their industry.” I objected on Twitter that I do not in fact hate trans people or women, nor do I argue against their civil rights even sporadically, much less ceaselessly. Many people agreed with me, which was nice to see since it’s clearly true. Unfortunately, several other people argued that it was fine to write in a public forum that I “argue ceaselessly” against civil rights for women and trans people on the grounds that they find some other thing I did objectionable, or that some other parts of Doyle’s article are true. I reject this. People should write true things rather than false things… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/weekend-update-march-20">https://www.slowboring.com/p/weekend-update-march-20</a>&gt; </p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p></p>
