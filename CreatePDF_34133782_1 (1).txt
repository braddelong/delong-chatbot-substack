Benjamin Wallace-Wells: Larry Summers Versus the Biden Administrationa€™ s Coronavirus-Stimulus 
Plan'. a€~a€oelt seems plausible,a€D Brad DeLong, an economic historian at Berkeley and a Clinton 
Treasury official, said, that a€oethe neoliberal era is overa€Ua€!. [He] guessed that about half of 
the leftward turn within this universe [of economists] wasa€! [because] a€oethere is
not nearly so much trust in the ability of the market to heal itselfa€Da€!. The other half, he 
said, was the part that tended to isolate Summers. DeLong ascribed it to politics, and to the 
general feeling (a€oein my view, twenty-seven years too latea€D) that Republicans would never be 
willing partners for expansive economic intervention.

There was little disagreement among liberal economists, he emphasized, over how the Biden 
Administration ought to spend the money in an ideal world: a€oeMost of us would say infrastructure 
rather than checksa€”if we had that option. Only Larry believes we have that option.a€D DeLonga€™ s 
own view is that if the Biden Administration had pared back the stimulus in the hopes of
building a bipartisan consensus for infrastructure, it would find that no such consensus existed. 
a€oeln the absence of Republican negotiating partners, center-left Democrats have got to look to 
the left,a€D DeLong said. a€oeThis is an example of that actually happeninga€Da€!
