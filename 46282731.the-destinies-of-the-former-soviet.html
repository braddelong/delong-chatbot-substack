He threatened you with a final exam if you do not do the reading beforehand, and participate actively, with the idea of making this class into a true discussion dialogue seminar, rather than a lecture. I now threaten you with making you write weekly memos on the current week’s reading, due before the class begins, as a way to “encourage” reading and preparation for thoughtful discussion. </p><p>But we're going to start by treating everyone, all of us, as adults—assuming that it's all going to work, and it's all going to work well.</p><p>Unfortunately, that just does not work on the first day.</p><p>It is psychologically and sociologically next to impossible to get people to do serious amounts of reading before the first day of class. Thus, almost invariably, first-day discussions about readings go over like lead balloons. I would be eager to be proved wrong today—to have this turn into a discussion. Right now, however, I'm envisioning that this first class is simply going to turn into a lecture. But you all are going to do the reading for the first week over the course of the next week, right? And if there is interest, we will take time next week to include short discussions of the papers on the first week of the reading list.</p><p>Note that it is not just that this course goes well in the sense that it is more fun if you discuss, and badly if we lecture.</p><p>It is also the case that if we lecture, maybe 10% of what we say becomes durably engraved on your neuronal patterns, and becomes part of your intellectual panoply on which you can draw in the future. And if it becomes a genuine, interactive, broad-based discussion, it becomes a truly marvelous and wonderful thing. People remember 90% of it. Afterwards, people speak of it as an intellect-changing experience.</p><p>But what we are, we are. And if we cannot move heaven and earth, we still do what we can, here in this fallen sublunary sphere, here at the start of the third year of the third millennium’s first global plague…</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/the-destinies-of-the-former-soviet?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thank you for reading Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality.

I remember Rudi Dornbush occasionally letting his hair down, sighing, and stating that the division-of-labor would have to be broken down and then built up again, person-by-person, workshop-by-workshop, and that it would be very long and painful. But even he thought that it would be ultimately successful, and in the end Eastern Europe would re-join what the first Marshall Plan had enabled the Western European norm to become.</p><p>I think Noah Smith's assessment, 30 years on, of what has happened is by-and-large correct:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Noah Smith</strong>: <em>How Are the Post-Soviet Economies Doing?</em>: ‘Four buckets…. </p><p>1.

Central Asian resource economies… have muddled along much as resource-based economies tend to do. </p><p>3. Russia and Belarus: Russia is its own strange hybrid of still-dysfunctional but often high-tech manufacturing economy and Central Asian resource economy, while Belarus is basically a satellite… whose fortunes rise and fall with Russia’s. </p><p>4. Frozen-conflict countries: Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Moldova… breakaway regions… military conflicts… prevented… from joining the EU (which is often Putin’s reason for supporting the breakaway regions and prosecuting the wars), which in turn has prevented them from getting on the fast track to industrialization…. It also tends to cause political instability…. </p><p>Milanovic’s verdict was prematurely pessimistic—freed from the shackles of communism, countries that aren’t dependent on natural resources have generally tended to converge….

All of the outward signs of a market economy in which the pursuit of productive efficiency is at least as good a road to riches as is the cultivation of politically-enforced monopoly are there. And yet only some of the investments are made.

The researchers’ recommendations for stemming this problem focus on closing the “gaps HCT actors exploit,” such as the ability to create sock puppet accounts and backups in case of deletion and the ability to mass-message random users and invite them to HCT-themed groups. The authors pushed to “dedicate additional policy resources on conspiracies harmful enough to warrant our strongest enforcements.” At the same time, they allowed that the harms HCTs can inflict—alongside “real world acts of physical violence”—include “excessive expenditure of FB resources” and “undue reputational risk.” At this point, it’s hard to consider such things harms against Facebook, which allows figures like the chiropractor to thrive in the first place. “Self-harms” might be more apt…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/01/facebook-papers-radicalized-chiropractor-ban-misinformation.html">https://slate.com/technology/2022/01/facebook-papers-radicalized-chiropractor-ban-misinformation.html</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Adam Gurri</strong>: <em>A Liberal at Home</em>: ‘I accept that I am an American, indeed I feel quite lucky to be one.
