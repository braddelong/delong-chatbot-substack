The article merely reprised the developments of a turbulent period simply in terms of a conflict between two individuals. It gives the false impression, casually smuggled in towards the end, that HAU remains substantially unchanged. Nothing could be further from the truth. HAU came into being as a radical departure from established ways…. Its independence was its strength…. Unfortunately, that very independence also proved a temporary weakness, that sustained an informality beyond when it was healthy for the journal…. This informality had to be the first thing that had to be addressed to re-establish trust in the journal and its workings, following the media campaign launched against HAU and its founder Giovanni da Col. The world of HAU described in Singal’s piece bears absolutely no resemblance to the new organisation of the journal or the ethos of its current structure of editorial collectives…. Rather than situate the events of the past within the broader concerns of contemporary publishing and its fraught relationship with academia, the article dwelled on gossip, email exchanges, and innuendo, shallow in its ethical judgement, and betrayed its informants. Its analytical value as a sociological analysis of academic practices is underwhelming and not up to the standards of CHE. On all counts, this was a missed opportunity…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/announcement/view/32">https://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/announcement/view/32</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>What, exactly, is “an informality beyond when it was healthy for the journal”? And what could “the media campaign launched against HAU and its founder Giovanni da Col” be, other than the “conflict between two individuals” that Jesse Singal describes? And what was “inchoate” about Jesse Singal’s story, other than that Anne-Christine Taylor and company would rather that nobody ever speak about what happened before they took over the journal? </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-11-22-mo?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-11-22-mo?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Phil Libin</strong>: <em>The Out-of-Office (OOO) World</em> &lt;<a href="https://watch.mmhmm.app/z_I82SbS72S6Q2FLjEmFQz">https://watch.mmhmm.app/z_I82SbS72S6Q2FLjEmFQz</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Wayne Ma</strong>: <em>Apple and Its Favorite Chipmaker Get Closer</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-and-its-favorite-chipmaker-get-closer">https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-and-its-favorite-chipmaker-get-closer</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Nina Burleigh</strong>: <em>Inside the Plot to Kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer</em>: ‘Sons of Anarchy: How an F.B.I. informant stopped the gun-crazed, conspiracy-theorizing group behind the plot to kidnap Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer… &lt;<a href="https://airmail.news/issues/2021-11-13/sons-of-anarchy">https://airmail.news/issues/2021-11-13/sons-of-anarchy</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Alice Evans</strong> &lt;<a href="https://www.draliceevans.com/">https://www.draliceevans.com/</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Foster Grant</strong>: <em>Word Counts of the Most Popular Books in the World</em>: ‘Les Miserables, Victor Hugo – 530,982 words.

Following a political crisis, South Korea dramatically altered its development strategy with a sector-specific industrial policy: the Heavy Chemical and Industry (HCI) drive, 1973–1979. With newly assembled historical data, I use the sharp introduction and withdrawal of industrial policies to study the impacts of industrial policy—during and after the intervention period. I show (1) HCI promoted the expansion and dynamic comparative advantage of directly targeted industries. (2) Using variation in exposure to policies through the input-output network, I show HCI indirectly benefited downstream users of targeted intermediates. (3) I find direct and indirect benefits of HCI persisted even after the end of HCI, following the 1979 assassination of the president. These effects include the eventual development of directly targeted exporters and their downstream counterparts. Together, my findings suggest that the temporary drive shifted Korea manufacturing into more advanced markets and created durable industrial change. These findings clarify lessons drawn from South Korea and the East Asian growth miracle…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="http://nathanlane.info/">http://nathanlane.info/</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Martin Wolf</strong>: <em>Best Books of 2021: Economics</em>: ‘_Cogs and Monsters: What Economics Is, and What It Should Be_, by Diane Coyle, Princeton University Press £20/$24: Coyle, now at Cambridge university, is an exceptionally thoughtful commentator on economics. In this book, she rejects what she calls the “straw men” arguments of the many critics of economics, though admitting how difficult it is for economists to be objective. Instead, she focuses on two other weaknesses: first, the assumption of the rational economic “cog” has become even more unrealistic in the age of “snowballing” digital “monsters”; and, second, practitioners of economics are wildly unrepresentative of the society they study…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/25ca2b59-8047-4f9b-bf99-e7f7c15d8d51">https://www.ft.com/content/25ca2b59-8047-4f9b-bf99-e7f7c15d8d51</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Doug (Mule)</strong>: <em>The Rising Tide of Semiconductor Cost</em>: ‘Shortages and the geopolitical concentration of TSMC and ASML have awakened the popular imagination and have highlighted the science-fiction-like process of chipmaking. The road ahead has obstacles that aren’t widely appreciated. Making a semiconductor is going to get even harder, more expensive, and more technical. In other words, the challenges are going to accelerate. To operate in the future, chipmakers will need more scale, more talent, and more money…. I want to first refresh you on the death of Moore’s Law. We’ve topped out the growth in transistor-energy scaling, frequency scaling, and we’re starting to hit the end of multi-core scaling in transistor-density increases. But more important than the end of those trends, cost scaling has ended. While we continue to improve transistor density through new techniques, each one layers additional costs. ASML, in its investor day, made a bold statement that Moore’s Law will continue with system-level scaling. Another name for this is advanced packaging. But these costs are additive to the already escalating costs of making a smaller transistor…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:44411731,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/the-rising-tide-of-semiconductor&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:22108,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Fabricated Knowledge&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ac6587ae-db17-41fa-b25f-7dc0b7c601be_1000x1000.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Rising Tide of Semiconductor Cost&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2021-11-22T16:28:16.514Z&quot;,&quot;like_count&quot;:3,&quot;comment_count&quot;:0,&quot;bylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:34637,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Doug (mule)&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1cfe3e8d-7894-47e1-b9e6-a4110b64795b_255x255.jpeg&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;long form rambles - with more insight and hopefully less noise &quot;,&quot;profile_set_up_at&quot;:&quot;2021-10-04T13:40:04.369Z&quot;,&quot;publicationUsers&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:121737,&quot;user_id&quot;:34637,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;admin&quot;,&quot;public&quot;:true,&quot;is_primary&quot;:false,&quot;publication&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:22108,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Fabricated Knowledge&quot;,&quot;subdomain&quot;:&quot;mule&quot;,&quot;custom_domain&quot;:&quot;www.fabricatedknowledge.com&quot;,&quot;custom_domain_optional&quot;:false,&quot;hero_text&quot;:&quot;Let's learn more about the world's most important manufactured product.

His abolition of term limits essentially means that he’s now president for life, effectively ending the system that had seen three peaceful transfers of executive power. And he has been more effective than any leader since Mao at creating a cult of personality around himself…. But other than turning a bureaucratic oligarchy into a personalistic dictatorship, what are Xi’s accomplishments, exactly?… There are multiple signs that Xi has actually weakened the capabilities of the Chinese juggernaut…. Xi Jinping took power at the end of 2012. By then, China was already undergoing a growth slowdown…. Why is China slowing down? Part of it is inherent to China’s growth model, which Xi inherited from his predecessors Jiang and Hu…. But if Xi didn’t create China’s economic dilemma, he didn’t do much to fix it either…. Xi has also reversed Deng and Jiang’s pattern of reforming state-owned enterprises and encouraging private-sector growth…. Xi’s reliance on SOEs… sets off alarm bells in other countries, who view state-backed competition as an unfair advantage…. Overall, Xi’s approach to the economy looks an awful lot like a kid playing with toys—smashing the ones he doesn’t like, telling his favored champions to go forth and conquer…. Why alienate India? Why push against Southeast Asian countries? Perhaps it was necessary for China to oppose Japan and the U.S. in order to complete its ascent to superpower status and avenge historical humiliations, but why did Xi choose to slap otherwise neutral or even friendly nations in the face?… Finally, we come to Covid… a number of… missteps…. First, there’s China’s “zero Covid” policy…. The government apparently bragged about its success so much that when the much more infectious Delta variant began to spread, Xi and his people felt that they would lose face if they changed to a “live with Covid” strategy….
