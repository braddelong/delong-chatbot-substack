If our death rate is 1% of those who got enough of a case to get subsequent immunity, then with 
600,000 deaths we have 20% of the total population immune as a result of their previous case. If 
one-third of those who had the disease also get vaccination, then that lowers the vaccination 
threshold for herd immunity against Delta to 72% of the total population. Therea€™ s a clump of 
blue-state counties
(unfortunately not Los Angeles) that are there or almost there.

The gob-smacking thing, of course, is the political divide: Trump and the Trumpists are both trying 
to take as much credit as possible for the success of Warp Speed, and telling their base that they 
arena€™t real men unless they are willing to fight the virus barehanded:

for at least 70% of all U.S. adults to have received their first vaccination shota€!. It looks like 
wea€™re gonna come in at a little over 67% of all U.S. adultsa€!.. How much of

marketplace. But did a self-regulating market even exist in the Bronze Age? And what can weight 
systems tell us? Researchers investigated the dissemination of weight
systems throughout Western Eurasia. Their simulation indicates that the interaction of merchants,

technology to weigh goodsa€!. The weight systems that emerged between Mesopotamia and Europe were 
very similar. This meant that a single merchant could travel, for instance, from
Mesopotamia to the Aegean and from there to Central Europe and never need to change their own set 
of weights. The merchant could trade with foreign partners while simply relying on approximating 
the weights. There was no international authority that could have regulated the accuracy of weight 
systems over such a wide territory and long time span. In Europe, beyond the
Aegean, centralised authorities did not even exist at this time. The researchers conclude that the 
emergence of accurate weight systems must have been the outcome of a global network regulating 
itself from the bottom-upa€!

Why ever would somebody who pledges allegiance to the idea that a€oeyou grab them by the vulva, and 
then they let you do whatever you wanta€D is not a road to the approval or even the tolerance of 
the Fair Sex? If your idea of a role model is somebody who thinks his best life is seeing how huge 
an a—hole he can be and still get away with it, you are not going to get tolerated or hired much. 
And no,
ita€™ s not a civil rights issue, ita€™ s a behave-like-a-normal-person issue. I laughed and 
laughed and laughed again:

Eric Kaufmann: Viewpoint Neutrality in Academia is a Civil Rights Issue: a€~Viewpoint neutrality 
should be legally mandated: When a sample of nearly 1,500 female Ivy League students was asked 
whether they would date a Trump supporter, only 6 percent said yes (after excluding the small 
minority of the sample who support him). So finds a survey of 20,000 university students
that the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) conducted in 2020. While people are 
free to discriminate however they wish in dating, this attitude bleeds into problematic spheres 
such as hiring and social tolerationa€!

Rather few liberal economists are engaged in what John Kenneth Galbraith called a€oethe search for 
a higher moral justification for selfishnessa€n. Most do not believe that a€oewhat I have, I 
holda€D is the height of moral reasoning. Rather, as Daniel Davies says, they believe a€oewe 
haven't yet discovered a better form of social organisation than private property for solving 
several important classes of
optimisation problemsa€D 
<https://blog.danieldavies.com/2003/05/tribute-that-vice-pays-to-virtue-what.html>. While that does 
easily turn into the idea that there is an a€oeoverriding constraint that the current owners of 
property must always be satisfied firsta€D, you can maintain appropriate distance. But I agree with 
Larry that, for someone trained neoclassically, it is hard. Only if you are by instinct a
collectivist should you study economics. If you are by instinct an individualists’’especially one 
who is even a little bit narcissistica€”you should study sociology instead:

Larry Mishel: a€™My dissertation advisor, a trust-busting guy, told me unions should file 
grievances but not affect wages. Thata€™ s because, like all the other liberals, he believed prices 
were set optimally and one should not intervene in any way to affect pricesa€!. Another professor 
had a sign on his door that said a€~tell me what you want and Ia€™ 11 tell you why you
cana€™ t have ita€™ , which is a fair description of the output of their policy advice. One 
professor introduced a class on a€~discriminationa€™, saying there were very interesting models 
(WTF, it is a very important topic and issue!). They loved industry deregulation, i.e. airlines, 
etc. The liberal, anti-poverty folks on faculty accepted there were big tradeoffs between social 
policy
and efficiencya€!. The macro policy people assumed the economy did have a natural tendency toward 
full employment. They were not racists, many were anti-racists, for sure. Basically, many of the 
liberals were hamstrung by their economics though they tried to be decent. In effect though, they 
embraced the kind of economics that enabled the rape of the working class over the last
forty years. Thata€™ s not lefta€!

I do not trust the calibration, or think that lottery-winners are the right group to look at: I am 
automatically selected-out of the sample, and my MPC matters for the average. But this is a step 
forward:

Mikhail Golosov & al.: How Americans Respond to Idiosyncratic & Exogenous Changes in Household 
Wealth & Unearned Income: a€~We study how Americans respond to idiosyncratic and exogenous changes 
in household wealth and unearned income. Our analyses combine administrative data on U.S. lottery 
winners with an event-study design that exploits variation in the
timing of lottery wins. Our first contribution is to estimate the earnings responses to these 
windfall gains, finding significant and sizable wealth and income effects. On average, an extra 
dollar of unearned income in a given period reduces pre-tax labor earnings by about 50 cents, 
decreases total labor taxes by 10 cents, and increases consumption by 60 cents. These effects are
heterogeneous across the income distribution, with households in higher quartiles of the income 
distribution reducing their earnings by a larger amount. Our second contribution is to develop and 
apply a rich life-cycle model in which heterogeneous households face non-linear taxes and make 
earnings choices along both intensive and extensive margins. By mapping this model to our
estimated earnings responses, we obtain informative bounds on the impacts of two policy reforms: an 
introduction of UBI and an increase in top marginal tax rates. Our last contribution is to study 
how additional wealth and unearned income affect a wide range of behavior, including geographic 
mobility and neighborhood choice, retirement decisions and labor market exit, family
formation and dissolution, entry into entrepreneurship, and job-to-job mobilitya€!

More worrisome, I think, is that Republicans now believe they have to pour rat poison down the well 
from which springs American solidarity and patriotism in order to come close enough for the 
less-democratic features of the American constitution to push them over the edge:

Ari Berman: Transcript: Ezra Klein Interview: a€~Well, the system itself is the biggest problem for 
the Democratic Partya€! [and] American politicsa€!. When you can win the popular vote for the 
presidency by 7 million votes, and the other candidate can come within 45,000 votes of winning the 
Electoral Collegea€!. the Senate being 50a€“50, but Democrats representing 41
million more Americansa€! a majority of Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican 
presidents who lost the popular vote, and confirmed by senators who represented a minority of 
Americans. On all of those fronts, it really doesna€™t seem like democracy is workinga€!

Where oh where is our Popular Front today?:

John Ganz: 6 FA©vrier 1934: a€~Although the rioters did not succeed in overthrowing the Republic, 
they did manage to bring down the government. Daladiera€™ s resolve began to wavera€!. Most of 
Daladiera€™ s cabinet and the leaders of the other parties encouraged him to resign. Only LA©on 
Blum remained steadfast and encouraged the premier to declare martial law and
keep parliament in permanent session; these two proposals were admittedly in tension with each 
other. Daladiera€! resigneda€!. The night of February 6 may have drawn the Right closer together in 
opposition to the Republic, but it would soon unite the Lefta€’’Socialist, Communist, and 
Radicala€”in its defensea€!
