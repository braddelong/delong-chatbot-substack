The idea that financial crises can be managed by mitigating the consequences ex post rather than preventing the problem ex ante has a bad reputation, mainly as a result of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7f8f4918-8bcb-11e6-8cb7-e7ada1d123b1">Alan Greenspan’s use of it</a> as an excuse for not doing more during the 2000s. But it’s not intrinsically unorthodox central banking. The optimal frequency of crises, as Professor Richard Portes once told me, is not zero. A central bank can’t anticipate everything and the perfect regulatory system doesn’t exist. Since central banks have the power to expand their balance sheets without limit, and so the ability to unstick frozen markets, why shouldn’t they use it sometimes?

The King might have withdrawn his mandate, his parliamentary allies could have fled, the opposition might have adopted a more muscular strategy, or the Fascist ultras may have launched a coup that justified governmental suppression of the Fascists in response. Mussolini took advantage of the disorganization of his opponents and the craven opportunism of his allies. It was the sort of tactical victory he had become expert in, riding out the storms while just managing to keep his coalition together. The killing of Giacomo Matteotti may have been reckless in that it created an unstable situation and threatened his rule, but ultimately it proved to be “the right move:” Mussolini removed an opponent of extraordinary courage and moral authority and created the conditions for consolidating control…</p></li><li><p><strong>Hermione McKenzie</strong>: <a href="https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/pdf/27856441.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Adb11fc82df56e46c3f3b575bf12ce33b&amp;ab_segments=&amp;origin=&amp;acceptTC=1">Review of </a><em><a href="https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/pdf/27856441.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Adb11fc82df56e46c3f3b575bf12ce33b&amp;ab_segments=&amp;origin=&amp;acceptTC=1">Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy…</a></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Noah Smith</strong>: <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/we-still-havent-solved-the-nuclear?utm_source=email">We still haven't solved the Nuclear Age</a>: ‘Maybe Feynman was right after all.
