James Madison: To William Bradford, 19 June 1775: a€~a€!It is imagined our Governor has been 
tampering with the Slaves & that he has it in contemplation to make great Use of them in case of a 
civil war in this province. To say the truth, that is the only part in which this Colony is 
vulnerable; & if we should be subdued, we shall fall like Achilles by the hand
of one that knows that secret. But we have a good cause & great Courage which are a great 
supportaCI

Benjamin Franklin: To Jonathan Shipley, 7 July 1775: a€~Your excellent Advice was, that if we must 
have a War, let it be carried on as between Nations who had once been Friends, and wish to be so 
againa€!. Lord Dunmore and Governor Martin, have already, we are told, taken some Steps towards., 
exciting an Insurrection among the Blacksa€!

Lund Washington: To George Washington, 3 December 1775’. a€~Our Dunmore has at length Publishd his 
much dreaded proclamation^” deci areg Freedom to All Indented Servts & Slaves (the Property of 
Rebels) that will repair to his majestys Standarda€”being able to bear Armsa€”What effect it will 
have upon those sort of people I cannot tella€”I think if
there was no white Servts in this family I shoud be under no apprehensition about the Slaves, 
however I am determined, that if any of them Create any confusition to make & [an] example of him, 
Sears who is at worck here says there is not a man of them, but woud leave us, if they believea€™ d 
they coud make there Escapea€”Tom Spears Excepteda€”& yet
they have no fault to find [.J Liberty is sweeta€! <https://founders .archives

Richard Henry Lee: To George Washington, 6 December 1775’. a€~The proclamation there alluded to, we 
have seen. It proclaims martial law thro Virginia and offers freedom to all the Slaves, calling 
their Masters rebels &c.a€”It seems this unlucky triumph over Hutchings with his less than half 
armed Militia, so dispirited the miserable wretches in that
neighborhood, that many have taken an oath of Ld Dunmores prescribing, reprobating Congress 
Committees &ca€! <https://founders.archives.gov/?q=Dunmore%20AND%20slaves&s=l

Lund Washington: To George Washington, 17 December 1775’. a€~Lord Dunmores Negroe Soldiers are, it 
is said, commanded by Scotchmena€’’proper Officers for Slaves, for they themselves Possess Slavish 
Principalsa€! <https://founders.archives.gov/?q=Dunmore%20AND%20slaves&s=1111311113&sa=&r=28&sr=>

George Washington: To Richard Henry Lee, 26 December 1775’. a€~Lord Dunmores Letters to General 
Howe &ca wch very fortunately fell into my hands, & Inclosed by me to Congress, will let you pretty 
fully into his diabolical Schemesa€”If my Dear Sir that Man is not crushed before Spring, he will 
become the most formidable Enemy America hasa€”his
strength will Increase as a Snow ball by Rolling; and faster, if some expedient cannot be hit upon 
to convince the Slaves and Servants of the Impotency of His designs. You will see by his Letters 
what pains he is taking to invite a Reinforcement at all eventaY'saY© there, & to transplant the 
War to the Southern Colonies. I do not think that forcing his Lordship
on  Ship board is sufficient; nothing less than depriving him of life or liberty will secure peace 
to Virginiaa€! <https://founders.archives.gov/?q=Dunmore%20AND%20slaves&s=l 111311113&sa=&r=29&sr=>

Samuel Hopkins: To Thomas Cushing, 29 December 1775’. a€~Does not the conduct of Lord Dunmore, and 
the ministerialists, in taking the advantage of the slavery practised among us, and encouraging all 
slaves to join them, by promising them liberty, point out the best, if not the only way to defeat 
them in this, viz. granting freedom to them ourselves, so as
no longer to use our neighboura€™ s service without wages, but give them for their labours what is 
equal and just?a€! <https://founders.archives.gov/?q=Dunmore%20AND%20slaves&s=l

Thomas Jefferson: I. Comments on SoulA©sa€™ Histoire, 3 August 1786: a€~La€™ humanitA© des 
Britons.a€™ a€! In ita€™ s relation of this wara€! they conducted it, both in theory and practice, 
on the most barbarous principles, that the expression here cited will stand in contradiction to the 
rest of the worka€!. For their practice, recollect their exciting
the savages against us, insurrections of our slaves, sending our prisoners to the East Indies, 
killing them in prison ships, keeping them on halfrations and of the most unwholsome qualities, 
cruel murders of unarmed individuals of every sex, massacres of those in arms after they had asked 
quarter &c. &ca€! <https://founders.archives.gov/?
