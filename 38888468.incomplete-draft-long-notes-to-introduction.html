He, however, confines his book to Europe, and both gains and loses thereby.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Giovanni Arrighi</strong> (1994): <em>The Long Twentieth Century</em> (New York: Verso) &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/longtwentiethcen00arri">https://archive.org/details/longtwentiethcen00arri</a>&gt;, on yet another hand, pushes the origins of the long twentieth century back to 1500 and medieval Genoa. There are 324 pages before his “Epilogue” begins, yet it is only on page 239 that we get to:</p><blockquote><p>The strategies and structures of capital accumulation that have shaped our times first came into existence in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. They originated in a new internalization of costs within the economizing logic of capitalist enterprise. Just as the Dutch regime had taken world-scale processes of capital accumulation one step further than the Genoese by internalizing protection costs, and the British regime had taken them a step further than the Dutch by internalizing production costs, so the US regime has done the same in relation to the British by internalizing transaction costs…</p></blockquote><p>Thus I cannot buy into his analysis because he sees the history of the long twentieth century as largely an intensified repeat of earlier cycles of internal capitalist development led by a <em>hegemon</em>—Genoese, Dutch, British, and now American. That is the grand narrative he tells, engagingly and convincingly. But it is definitely not mine, and I definitely do not think it is the most important thread</p><div><hr></div><p>3) &nbsp;<strong>Friedrich A, von Hayek</strong>, “The Use of Knowledge in Society,” <em>American Economic Review </em>Vol. 35, No. 4 (September 1945), pp. 519-530.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>…the proportional rate of growth of my index of the value of the stock of useful ideas about manipulating nature and organizing humans…</em>: In the aggregate growth-modeling tradition that has developed from Robert Solow, “A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth”, <em>Quarterly Journal of Economics</em>, Vol. 70, No. 1 (Feb., 1956), pp. 65-94 &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1884513&gt;, the level of real net output per worker Y/L, with Y for net output and L for the labor force, is a simple mathematical function of the capital-intensity of the economy K/Y, of how much of produced means-of-production K per unit of net output there is assisting workers in creating that output per worker; and of the efficiency of labor E:</p><p>Y/L = (K/Y)^(⍺/(1-⍺)) E</p><p>Such an economy will tend to converge to a steady-state growth path in which the capital intensity K/Y approaches its steady-state value (K/Y)* given by:</p><p>(K/Y)^* = s/(n+g)</p><p>Where s is the net savings-investment rate of the economy, n is the proportional rate of growth of the labor force L, and g is the proportional rate of growth of labor efficiency E. (Yes: you usually see this equation with a “δ” in the denominator for the depreciation rate on capital, and with Y defined not as net but gross output, and with s defined as the gross savings rate out of gross output. But—as Solow pointed out to me, and has Piketty has stressed—while there is reason to think that having people save a constant proportion of their net output is a reasonable baseline case to start from, there is no reason to think that people save a constant proportion of their gross output—that net savings would be less in an otherwise-identical economy where capital equipment just happened to be less durable.)</p><p>The efficiency of labor E can then be thought of as a function of the level of knowledge about “technology” H—discovered, developed, and deployed ideas about manipulating nature and organizing humans—and of resources per worker R/L, where more resources per worker allow humans to be more productive, and where increasing resource scarcity leads to a fall in net output per worker Y/L unless there are countervailing improvements in knowledge:</p><p>E = H (R/L)^ƛ</p><p>When natural resources are constant—as they are for the world economy as a whole, although not for individual sub civilizations—this means that the proportional growth rate of the efficiency of labor is:</p><p>g = h - ƛn</p><p>If we assume that the world economy’s steady-state capital-output ratio is constant across and within eras of economic growth, then the rate of growth of output per worker g_Y/L will be the same as the rate of growth of the efficiency of labor g. We can then read what the proportional rate of growth of knowledge about technology h from the rate of growth of average labor productivity and the rate of growth of the global labor force:</p><p>h = g_Y/L + ƛn</p><p>I assume ƛ=1/2. Why? If ƛ=0, we are assuming that resource scarcity is simply not a thing: that at a given level of technological knowledge standards of living are independent of how large average firms are and how many workers are drawing on the same metal deposits. If ƛ=1, we are assuming that labor is simply unproductive: that total output depends only on the level of technological knowledge H and the level of natural resources R, with a doubling of the labor force leading to a halving of labor productivity. Both of those are clearly wrong.

My suspicion is that at least in English standard readings of Marx and Engels, at least of the Marx and Engels authorial team in the late 1840s, are not technologically determinist enough. What I see as an assertion in the connotations of the German original of <em>Alles Ständische und Stehende verdampft</em> that it is <em>technology</em> that is doing the work is lost in the traditional English translation “all that is solid melts into air”.

The narrative function is losing its functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal. It is being dispersed in clouds of narrative language…. Where, after the metanarratives, can legitimacy reside?…”</p><p>Lyotard and other poststructuralist thinkers (like Foucault) view this as a broadly positive development for a number of reasons. First, attempts to construct grand theories tend to unduly dismiss the naturally existing chaos and disorder of the universe, the power of the individual event. Lyotard proposed that metanarratives should give way to petits récits, or more modest and "localized" narratives, which can ''throw off" the grand narrative by bringing into focus the singular event. Borrowing from the works of Wittgenstein and his theory of the "models of discourse", Lyotard constructs his vision of a progressive politics, grounded in the cohabitation of a whole range of diverse and always locally legitimated language-games. </p><p>Postmodernists attempt to replace metanarratives by focusing on specific local contexts as well as on the diversity of human experience. They argue for the existence of a "multiplicity of theoretical standpoints" rather than for grand, all-encompassing theories. According to John Stephens and Robyn McCallum, a metanarrative "is a global or totalizing cultural narrative schema which orders and explains knowledge and experience" – a story about a story, encompassing and explaining other "little stories" within conceptual models that assemble the "little stories" into a whole. Postmodern narratives will often deliberately disturb the formulaic expectations such cultural codes provide, pointing thereby to a possible revision of the social code…</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>12) Greg Clark, <em>A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World</em>, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007 &lt;http://books.google.com/?id=VKBOmAEACAAJ&gt;.</p><div><hr></div><p>13) John Stuart Mill, <em>Principles of Political Economy, with Some of Their Applications to Social Philosophy</em>, London: Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer, 1873, p. 516 &lt;http://books.google.com/?id=xXU9AAAAYAAJ&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>(14) Edward Bellamy, <em>Looking Backward, 2000-1887</em>, Boston: Ticknor, 1888 &lt;http://books.google.com/?id=nRMZAAAAYAAJ&gt;; Edward Bellamy, “How I Came to Write Looking Backward,” The Nationalist (May 1889) &lt;https://www.depauw.edu/sfs/documents/bellamy.htm&gt;.</p><div><hr></div><p>15) Bellamy, <em>Looking Backward</em>, pp. 152-8.</p><div><hr></div><p>(16) Oxford Reference: &lt;https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/ authority.20110803115009560&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>17) His favorite Kant quotation.

primarily on (a) its willingness to save and invest, and (b) the efficiency of its workers, which is in turn a function of (c) its level of technology—its useful ideas about manipulating nature and organizing humans—and (d) its natural resources per worker.</p></li><li><p>A society’s population growth rate depends on (a) its level of consumption of necessities that make you biologically fit to reproduce relative to (b) its sociologically-determined familial and other institutions that potentially curb the rate of reproduction.</p></li><li><p>Societies differ in the proportion of their productive resources they allocate to necessities vis-à-vis luxuries.</p></li><li><p>Technological progress before the Industrial-Revolution Age proceeded at a slow average proportional growth rate h measured in hundredths of a percent per year.</p></li></ol><p>Then we get:</p><ul><li><p>The right-hand side of the slide above: the society’s level of productivity per worker will head for and then tend to oscillate around a Malthusian level equal to (a) the society’s taste for non-necessities (which include such things as having a rapacious and greedy upper class, and liking to live in cities), times (b) its sociologically-determined subsistence level of necessities consumption (which can be raised by things like a late age of first female marriage, large-scale female infanticide, or frequent chevauchées), times quantitatively unimportant nuisance terms.</p></li><li><p>The left-hand side of the slide above: the society’s population density will head for and then tend to oscillate around a Malthusian level equal to (a) the quality and abundance of natural resources per acre, times (b) the ratio of the technology level to the “subsistence” level of necessities consumption at which the population barely replaces itself, times (c) the propensity to save and invest in everything that makes humanity more productive (from tools to liming the soil to building commercial networks), (d) a chief boost to which its the provision of a pax imperia, times (e) the inverse of the taste for non-necessities, all (e) raised to the power that is the extent that higher population induces resource scarcity and thus lower productivity, times quantitatively unimportant nuisance terms.</p></li></ul><p>As the centuries and millennia pass, the Malthusian equilibrium level of population density will slowly rise as technology improves.</p><p>And as the centuries and millennia pass, the Malthusian level of typical human living standards will slowly rise even as necessities-valued production per worker does not to the extent that there is faster technological progress in making middle-class conveniences than in making true bioreproductive necessities.</p><p>But even though a society tends to go back to its Malthusian equilibrium, it does not have to be there: all kinds of shocks can knock it away.</p><p>Moreover, and more important, the Malthusian equilibrium can and does shift. There are BigTime changes across societies and over time as polity and sociology shift in:</p><ul><li><p>the subsistence level of necessities consumption</p></li><li><p>the taste for luxuries</p></li><li><p>the incentives to save and invest</p></li></ul><p>These drive big differences in how societies look and are, and big differences in how societies’ economies grow and shrink: truly dire Dark Ages like post-Roman Britain or the early-Iron Age Ægean; truly magnificent (if often cruel and astonishingly unequal) civilizational “efflorescences” as Jack Goldstone has taught us to call them. Establish a pax imperia, with associated protection of commerce and industry from freelance expropriation by thugs with spears through a government that controls its own functionaries and so generate lots of savings, investment, and an increased division of labor; acquire a taste for luxuries, especially living in cities and upper-class and even middle-class display of comfort; and generate sociological institutions that curb and control female fertility and female-child survival, and watch what happens. On the other side, have barbarians within the gate so that as much wealth as possible is immediately turned into silver and buried, establish a sociology of very early female first marriage, and have little taste for or indeed specialization in producing non-necessities—and your Malthusian equilibrium can shift to something of interest to archæologists, but not of interest to artists or indeed to connoisseurs of material culture.</p><p>Moreover, remember this always: the gulf between the standard of living of the upper and even the middle class (who leave the major archæological footprint) on the one hand and the peasant-craftsman-servant working class on the other, whose reproduction generates the resource scarcity that anchors the Malthusian equilibrium—that can and does vary widely and wildly as well.</p><p>That pre-Industrial Revolution Age history was “Malthusian” does not mean that nothing interesting happened, or that everything was the same.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality is a reader-supported publication.
