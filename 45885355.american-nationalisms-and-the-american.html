English has—and Latin lacks—both the indefinite article <em><strong>a</strong></em> and the definite article <em><strong>the</strong>. </em>The existence of these is an enormous aid to quickly saying exactly what one means. But it is also a great aid to creating strawmen that you can then light on fire. Here Sean Wilentz uses this linguistic feature. He says not that Holton and Taylor say that white supremacy has been <em><strong>a</strong></em> driving force of American history, but that they say it has been <em><strong>the</strong></em> driving force. </p><p>Hijinx ensue:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sean Wilentz</strong>: <em>The Paradox of the American Revolution</em>: ‘Recent books by Woody Holton and Alan Taylor offer fresh perspectives… overemphasize the importance of white supremacy as its driving force…. Descriptions of America’s egalitarian founding principles as covers for white supremacy—“formulated to promote exclusion and oppression”—have gained a sudden currency. By these lights, the Revolution was in large measure a proslavery secession sparked by American fears of British threats to slavery…. Two ambitious new studies, <em>Liberty Is Sweet</em> by Woody Holton on the Revolution and <em>American Republics</em> by Alan Taylor… take up the array of political and social transformations that shaped the nation’s growth…. Yet both books advance claims in accord with interpretations of white supremacy as the driving force of American history. Holton and Taylor are serious scholars, and given the larger stakes involved, the reliability of their conclusions on these matters assumes importance in debates that go far beyond the academy…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/01/13/the-paradox-of-the-american-revolution/">https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/01/13/the-paradox-of-the-american-revolution/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Was white supremacy <em><strong>a</strong></em> driving force behind the American Revolution? Let’s look at the <em>Pennsylvania Journal &amp; Weekly Advertiser</em> of December 6, 1775:</p><blockquote><p>Not in the legions of horrid Hell can come a devil more damn’d In evils, to top D*****e.</p><blockquote><p>By His Excellency the Right Honorable JOHN Earl of DUNMORE, His MAJESTY'S Lieutenant and Governor General of the Colony and Dominion of VIRGINIA, and Vice Admiral of the same.</p><p>A PROCLAMATION.</p><blockquote><p>As I have ever entertained Hopes that an Accommodation might have taken Place between GREAT‐BRITAIN and this colony, without being compelled by my Duty to this most disagreeable but now absolutely necessary Step, rendered fo by a Body of armed Men unlawfully assembled, bring on His MAJESTY'S Tenders, and the formation of an Army, and that Army now on their March to attack His MAJESTY'S troops and destroy the well disposed Subjects of this Colony. To defeat such unreasonable Purposes, and that all such Traitors, and their Abetters, may be brought to Justice, and that the Peace, and good Order of this Colony may be again restored, which the

I do require every Person capable of bearing Arms, to His MAJESTY'S STANDARD, or be looked upon as Traitors to His MAJESTY'S Crown and Government, and thereby become liable to the Penalty the Law inflicts upon such Offences; such as forfeiture of Life, confiscation of Lands, &amp;c. &amp;c. </p><p><strong>And I do hereby further declare all indentured Servants, Negroes, or others, (appertaining to Rebels,) free that are able and willing to bear Arms, they joining His MAJESTY'S Troops as soon as may be</strong>, for the more speedily reducing this Colony to a proper Sense of

present most unhappy Country, or demanded of them for their former salutary Purposes, by Officers properly authorised to receive the fame.</p><p>GIVEN under my Hand on board the ship WILLIAM, off

People have moved to Kentucky because they want elbow room, and do not like being forced by government and society to conform. Once people are in Kentucky they become the kinds of people who can build a log cabin with their bare hands in 48 hours, and bring down a squirrel for squirrel stew at 300 yards. Thus heredity and environment—blood and soil—produce a special kind of person. And those who come to the U.S. hoping to live in, say, a little Mogadishu or a little Kishinev or a little Cuzco cannot fit. This blood-and-soil Kentucky anti-government nationalism is not exactly hostile to slavery—for those who were not born and raised to bring down squirrels for squirrel stew at 300 years cannot, really belong. </p><p>Virginia-style American nationalism is different. People have moved to Virginia because they want elbow room and freedom from government, just as people move to Kentucky. People have moved to Virginia to make a new society free from the mistakes and oppressions of the Old World, yes. But the Virginians are not interested in being hard-scrabble rather-poor self-reliant frontiersmen. The Virginia people are on the make: in the Old World aristocracies and governments would keep them down. In the New World they are free—and one element of freedom is the ability to make other people unfree.</p><p>And then there is Massachusetts-style American nationalism. It has its roots in the Puritan settlers of—guess what?—Massachusetts. You are part of a community engaged in an Errand Unto the Wilderness. Your Errand is to build a Utopia:e a City Upon a Hill to shine a light for All Nations. In building this utopia, we are all in this together with no special authorities or leaders because of the Priesthood of All Believers. Never mind that John Winthrop would run screaming from us: we are his children, his bastard children, children he would regard as unworthy, but his children nevertheless. The Massachusetts-style American nationalism of election—that America really consists of those of us who have come here to build a common Utopia—is very powerful. I think it is much more correct, much more sociologically healthy, and something we all can be proud of.</p><p>Highlighting slavery and white supremacy in American history focuses attention on, and amplifies, the cleavages and divisions between Kentucky, Virginia, and American nationalism. Kentucky-style is white supremacist—indeed, hard-scrabble rural supremacist, if not focused on exploiting others. Virginia-style is how government is not going to constrain you—how if you are strong, you do what you want (and if you are weak, you suffer what you must). It is more rich- or rather successful-supremacist than white-supremacist, but the political three-card-monte game of keeping the non-successful on your side by paying them the wages of ethnic supremacy.</p><p>But if white supremacy is not <em><strong>a</strong></em> major driving force of American history, you can largely elide the differences between the three, and portray the utopia as a utopia of individual choice, freedom, and tolerance. And so, in my view at least, Sean Wilentz finds himself driven to light on fire his strawman that white supremacy is <em><strong>the</strong></em> driving force, in the hope of then persuading people to forget that it is a driving force, and forget that the cleavages between Kentucky, Virginia, and Massachusetts styles of American nationalism are deep and wide.</p><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/american-nationalisms-and-the-american?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thank you for reading Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality.

But Brazil is also burdened by mass poverty, backwardness, and a political class that seems to have advanced little since its days as a slaveholding landed elite…. For the better-off societies in the South, now called “emerging markets,” neoliberal development aped the tacit assumptions of modernization theory in assuming these countries were just “late,” but that they would get there eventually—they would become “like us.” Just look at the shopping malls springing up in São Paulo or Bangkok or Cairo!… Mexico, South Korea, and a handful of countries in Eastern Europe joined the OECD in the 1990s, with Chile following in 2010. It was only a matter of time…. [But] Brazil… finds itself stuck… modern but not modern enough…. The Global North… today… not just inequality and informalization of work, but increasingly venal elites, political volatility, and social ungluing.

We failed… ran out of money and couldn’t pay our bills or our employees. If we’d had any other investor than Steve, we would have been dead in the water. But at every failure—presumably because Steve couldn’t sustain the embarrassment that his next enterprise after the Apple ouster would be a failure—he’d berate those of us in management… then write another check…. Then, at last, Moore’s Law saved us. The ever-falling cost of processing power finally made The Movie economically feasible. We said we could make The Movie, and Disney stepped forward to finance it, saving Steve Jobs’s face (and investment) and saving Pixar the company…. Steve Jobs… was a hardware man. The Movie had been our dream and goal since the 1970s…. During the next four years, Pixar completed The Movie—Toy Story—and it premiered in 1995. <em>Toy Story</em> was wildly successful almost as soon as the movie was in the can. Pixar and Disney took it to New York City for a first glimpse by critics, and their enthusiasm was electric…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-real-story-of-pixar">https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-real-story-of-pixar</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Eric Topol</strong>: <em>The Very Bad Day at the CDC</em>: ‘the CDC performance is disappointing and unacceptable, despite high hopes and a boosted budget to perform well.

And pragmatically: 14 books, 8 seasons. There’s no way a single book would translate to even 1 season if shot scene by scene…. Asuper faithful adaptation would miss the mark, because it risks becoming soulless. What works in TV doesn’t work in books and vice versa…. What I’m looking for in an adaptation is vision, and keeping to the spirit…. I read the WoT books when I was a teenager, and I’m getting that same vibe from the TV series than I got from them then. And to me that’s enough, and I can’t wait to see what happens with the new material…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/aliettedb/status/1474742950441762816&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;A brief thread of my adaptation thoughts, because I see there's much unhappiness on the series of Wheel of Time not being faithful to the books\n1/?&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;aliettedb&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Aliette de Bodard&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sat Dec 25 14:04:53 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:42,&quot;like_count&quot;:246,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"><a class="tweet-link-top" href="https://twitter.com/aliettedb/status/1474742950441762816" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-header-avatar" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/twitter_name/w_96/aliettedb.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @aliettedb" loading="lazy"><div class="tweet-header-text"><span class="tweet-author-name">Aliette de Bodard </span><span class="tweet-author-handle">@aliettedb</span></div></div><div class="tweet-text">A brief thread of my adaptation thoughts, because I see there's much unhappiness on the series of Wheel of Time not being faithful to the books
