The First Amendment and Section 230 let private companies like Twitter and Facebook choose how to moderate their sites.</em>&nbsp;2. American free speech rights are exceptional and protect a very large amount of speech many of us would agree is dangerous or harmful. That broad protection helps insulate speech from political and ideological urges to censor. 3. But the government has a leadership function as well as a governing one. Part of leadership is praising good behavior and condemning bad behavior, in hopes that people will do the right thing, without the coercion of law. 4. Facebook has a right to make money off of this alarming and deadly disinformation. But that doesn’t make it the right thing to do. Just as Americans have the right to say poisonous and ugly things to each other, that doesn’t make it right. 5. When Facebook is exercising its right to profit off of deadly propaganda about COVID, it’s doing the wrong moral thing. It’s being a bad citizen. The First Amendment protects it from coercion, but not from criticism—yours and ours. 6. We call on Facebook to reconsider its stance. We’ve identified common anti-scientific propaganda that puts lives at risk. Facebook can continue to profit off of it. But it can choose not to. We call on Facebook to do the right thing—for Americans and their lives.</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/Popehat/status/1416132396034846720">https://twitter.com/Popehat/status/1416132396034846720</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-16-fr?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-16-fr?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Lex Fridman</strong>: <em>Paul Krugman: Economics of Innovation, Automation, Safety Nets &amp; UBI</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJQepiqSWvg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJQepiqSWvg</a>&gt;</p><div id="youtube2-OJQepiqSWvg" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;OJQepiqSWvg&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OJQepiqSWvg?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><em>The Policy Impacts Library</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://policyimpacts.org/policy-impacts-library">https://policyimpacts.org/policy-impacts-library</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>James Tobin</strong>: _Money &amp; Income: Post Hoc Ergo Procter Hoc? &lt;<a href="https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/readings/tobin-1970-money-income.pdf">https://github.com/braddelong/public-files/blob/master/readings/tobin-1970-money-income.pdf</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Brian Deese</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Biden White House Plan for a New US Industrial Policy</em>: ‘Below is National Economic Council Director Brian Deese’s speech on US industrial policy as prepared for delivery at the Atlantic Council on June 23, 2021… &lt;<a href="https://portside.org/2021-06-26/biden-white-house-plan-new-us-industrial-policy">https://portside.org/2021-06-26/biden-white-house-plan-new-us-industrial-policy</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Anicca Harriot</strong>: ‘<em>Academic writing is wild</em> because you’ll read four articles just to write one sentence.

The shocks to the system from the overproduction of certain primary products such as wheat; from the 1927 reduction of interest rates in the United States (if it was one); from the halt of lending to Germany in 1928; or from the stock-market crash of 1929 were not so great. Shocks of similar magnitude had been handled in the stock-market break in the spring of 1920 and the 1927 recession in the United States. The world economic system was unstable unless some country stabilized it, as Britain had done in the nineteenth century and up to 1913. In 1929, the British couldn’t and the United States wouldn’t…</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Matthew Boudway</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Eric Hobsbawm, 1917 - 2012</em>: ‘Hobsbawm described himself as a “Tory communist”…. Hobsbawm… found much of the Sixties counterculture decadent and, at best, counterproductive…. Hobsbawm also became an object lesson in the dangers of ideological devotion. His passion for justice drew him into a cause that would require him to excuse… many injustices…. A lot of Western Communists abandoned ship after the Soviet crackdown on Hungary in 1956. Not Hobsbawm. Nor did he quit after the tanks rolled into Prague…. He famously claimed that if the Soviet Union had succeeded in creating a true communist society, it would have been worth the deaths of the twenty million people who perished under Stalin…. Self-sacrifice wasn’t the only kind of sacrifice that socialism might require…. He was…, a man who had subordinated everything to a single hope. He would admit that this hope had been disappointed, but he would not renounce it. To do so would have been to renounce himselfs…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/eric-hobsbawm-1917-2012">https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/eric-hobsbawm-1917-2012</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>William Faulkner</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Intruder in the Dust&nbsp;</em>: ‘It’s all now you see. Yesterday won’t be over until tomorrow and tomorrow began ten thousand years ago. For every Southern boy fourteen years old, not once but whenever he wants it, there is the instant when it’s still not yet two o’clock on that July afternoon in 1863, the brigades are in position behind the rail fence, the guns are laid and ready in the woods and the furled flags are already loosened to break out and Pickett himself with his long oiled ringlets and his hat in one hand probably and his sword in the other looking up the hill waiting for Longstreet to give the word and it’s all in the balance, it hasn’t happened yet, it hasn’t even begun yet, it not only hasn’t begun yet but there is still time for it not to begin against that position and those circumstances which made more men than Garnett and Kemper and Armistead and Wilcox look grave yet it’s going to begin, we all know that, we have come too far with too much at stake and that moment doesn’t need even a fourteen-year-old boy to think This time. Maybe this time with all this much to lose than all this much to gain: Pennsylvania, Maryland, the world, the golden dome of Washington itself to crown with desperate and unbelievable victory the desperate gamble, the cast made two years ago; or to anyone who ever sailed a skiff under a quilt sail, the moment in 1492 when somebody thought This is it: the absolute edge of no return, to turn back now and make home or sail irrevocably on and either find land or plunge over the world’s roaring rim…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1121143-intruder-in-the-dust">https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1121143-intruder-in-the-dust</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>Nathan Andrew: Jing Huang, Factionalism in Chinese Communist Politics: ‘Huang offers a convincing new narrative of CCP political history from 1935 to about 1987, built around the idea of what he calls the Yan’an Round Table…. The lack of any civilian control over the military below the level of the functionally autonomous Central Military Commission sustained the need for a top leader to bridge the two domains of power, and the top leader’s authority in turn depended on maintaining this military-civilian gap. Anyone who tried to do a good job in some functional area (like the economy) by co-operating with other administrators, found himself violating Mao’s power interest in keeping the system fractionalised, and was therefore likely to be purged. Anyone whom Mao chose as a successor, and who therefore began to accumulate power across bureaucratic systems or factions, threatened Mao’s interests and had to be purged…. Late in his life Mao was surrounded by leaders lacking deep roots in either the military or the Party bureaucracy…</p><p>LINK:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cefc.com.hk/article/jing-huang-factionalism-in-chinese-communist-politics/">https://www.cefc.com.hk/article/jing-huang-factionalism-in-chinese-communist-politics/</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Scott Alexander</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Book Review: How Asia Works</em>: ‘ Studwell’s guide to good economic policy…. 1.

Financial hubs… good work if you can get it…. “High-value agricultural producers”… Denmark and New Zealand…. They also don’t scale…. Third, manufacturing, eg everyone else…. In addition to domestic competition, these governments enforced “export discipline”. In order to keep their government perks (and sometimes in order to keep existing at all), companies needed to sell a certain amount of units abroad…. Aren’t there good free-market arguments against tariffs and government intervention in the economy? The key counterargument is that developing country industries aren’t just about profit. They’re about learning…. 3. Finance… is really a corollary of the industrial policy section. Developing country financial systems need to support industrial policy by preferentially offering great loans to industrial learning projects…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-how-asia-works">https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-how-asia-works</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-16-fr/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-07-16-fr/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>(Remember: You can subscribe to this… weblog-like newsletter… here:&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>There’s a free email list.
