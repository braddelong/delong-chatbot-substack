In short, there are Marxist/class-based explanations for the rise of neoliberalism that contrast with Brad’s. It could be an interesting conversation to have. I am referring to Thomas Piketty’s <em>Capital in the 21st century</em> &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674430006">https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674430006</a>&gt; and David Kotz’s <em>The Rise &amp; Fall of Neoliberal Capitalism</em> &lt;<a href="https://hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674980013">https://hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674980013</a>&gt;.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Brad DeLong</strong>: My neo-Polanyiesque framing of the long 20th century in <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em> &lt;<a href="http://bit.ly/3pP3Krk">bit.ly/3pP3Krk</a>&gt; commits me to a deeper explanation of the rise of the Neoliberal Order than simply "the revolt of the haves”. My interpretation has to be that the version of social justice offered by the New Deal Order—full employment, strong unions, public provision of both public goods and private commodities for free over a wide range, and a highly progressive tax-and-transfer system—was sustainable as long as economic growth was high and prices stable, but not otherwise.</p><p>The first speed-bump with respect to real income growth and inflation brought to the fore the complaints about the New Deal Order’s version of social justice:</p><ol><li><p>It treated unequals equally—especially African-Americans getting above themselves and wanting “preferential treatment"</p></li><li><p>It failed to make life for the lazy and shiftless difficult enough—people who were not hard-working ought to be more miserable than they were.</p></li><li><p>It failed to offer sufficient respect to those whose success in the marketplace gave them warrant to demand such respect.</p></li></ol><p>In short, the New Deal Order made social power too equal: it was held by people by virtue of their status as citizens plus their after-tax wealth. But society—at least in the form of its public-sphere megaphones that could command legislative majorities and cultural hegemony—saw social justice as requiring that some citizens have more social power than others by virtue of ethnicity and cultural heritage, and that property inequality-generated divergences in social power not be too greatly—and unfairly—curbed</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4dad5a0-81f5-4d8c-8f54-1b2b0d635203_1432x994.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4dad5a0-81f5-4d8c-8f54-1b2b0d635203_1432x994.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4dad5a0-81f5-4d8c-8f54-1b2b0d635203_1432x994.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4dad5a0-81f5-4d8c-8f54-1b2b0d635203_1432x994.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4dad5a0-81f5-4d8c-8f54-1b2b0d635203_1432x994.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a4dad5a0-81f5-4d8c-8f54-1b2b0d635203_1432x994.png" width="1432" height="994" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a4dad5a0-81f5-4d8c-8f54-1b2b0d635203_1432x994.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:994,&quot;width&quot;:1432,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:993993,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4dad5a0-81f5-4d8c-8f54-1b2b0d635203_1432x994.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4dad5a0-81f5-4d8c-8f54-1b2b0d635203_1432x994.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4dad5a0-81f5-4d8c-8f54-1b2b0d635203_1432x994.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4dad5a0-81f5-4d8c-8f54-1b2b0d635203_1432x994.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Otto von Bismarck in the late 1800s maintained his rule by saying:</p><ol><li><p>The liberals believe that only private property should be a source of social power—and you poor do not believe that, but rather that community and tradition should be sources too. So you belong with us.</p></li><li><p>The socialists believe that that social power should be equalized—even to the extent of giving an equal share to Poles, and Frenchmen. So you belong with us.</p></li></ol><p>Just the “revolt of the haves” would not have been enough. It was a lot of have-nots believing that the haves should have more; and that somehow the New Deal Order’s belief that the haves should have less undermined their own status derived from the little they had managed to attain.</p><p>In some ways this—unequal status-based social power is more “socially just” than less-unequal market-plus-redistribution—is datable back to 1848, or even before.</p><p>Cf. Tocqueville, “Souvenirs”:</p><blockquote><p>In the country all the landed proprietors, whatever their origin, antecedents, education or means, had come together, and seemed to form but one class: all former political hatred and rivalry of caste or fortune had disappeared from view. There was no more jealousy or pride displayed between the peasant and the squire, the nobleman and the commoner; instead, I found mutual confidence, reciprocal friendliness, and regard.</p><p>Property had become, with all those who owned it, a sort of badge of fraternity. The wealthy were the elder, the less endowed the younger brothers; but all considered themselves members of one family, having the same interest in defending the common inheritance. As the French Revolution had infinitely increased the number of land-owners, the whole population seemed to belong to that vast family.</p><p>I had never seen anything like it, nor had anyone in France within the memory of man…</p></blockquote><p>Now is this all <em><strong>true</strong></em>? </p><p>The logic of me choosing my neo-Polanyiesque Grand Narrative as the structuring frame of my book on the grounds that it is the least-false Grand Narrative I can think of—having done that, I am then committed to this particular not “class” but rather “market vs. status” explanation. </p><p>But that my Grand Narrative is least-false in general for the Long 20th Century does not make it true for the Neoliberal Turn that was the collapse of the New Deal and the rise of the Neoliberal Order.</p><p class="button-wrapper"
