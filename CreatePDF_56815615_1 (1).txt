I confess that I do not think it would've been realistic to ask for a better book trade press 
reviews, or for better blurbs from people of weight and influence who do not happen to be my 
friends: these are wonderful in themselves, and also wonderful because they are real guides to how 
reviewers in general will react to the book when they push their way through it.

But then there is the question of general readers. General readers are neither paid nor under 
social obligation to push their way through to the end of the book, and so are a very different 
kettle of fish Dash or, rather, very, very many different kettles of fish with respect to how they 
read. And I really, really want them to greatly enjoy the book and tell all their friends to read 
it.
In writing the book, I tried very hard to make it the case that on every page there was:

1. an important or arresting fact to catch their interest,

2. enough of a sense of narrative thrust to make them want to turn the page to see what happens 
next, and

3. a way to slot what happened on that page into the grand narrative or at least into one of the 
principal subsidiary narrativesa€”(a) the power and importance of the economic, (b) the world 
globalizing, (c) the driving technological cornucopia, (d) governments mismanaging, or (e) 
tyrannies intensifying.
I                                                                                                   
                                          do not think I managed to accomplish this on every page. 
But I tried. And I managed on some.

I am not worried about priming reviewersa€”I think that when they pick up the book, google, skim a 
few links, and start to read, they are and will be primed properly (because they will immediately 
run across Noah Smitha€™ s very gracious review:

But this is the question I am now asking myself: Is there anything I can do to general readers, so 
that they will be predisposed to be appreciative? Or is it just too late for me to do anything?

TRADE REVIEWS:

Publishers Weekly: J. Bradford DeLong: a€ceSlouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the 
Twentieth Centuryd€U2 a€~Spectacular economic growth in the long 20th century fueled visionary 
hopes, but never quite fulfilled them, according to this sweeping study. UC Berkeley economic 
historian DeLong (coauthor, Concrete Economics') surveys the period from 1870 to 2010, an era when, 
he argues, advances in global shipping, vertically integrated
corporations, and new technologies hatched in industrial research labs created an unprecedented 
rise in productivity that for the first time raised humanity out of poverty. It was also a period 
when economic theories and crises drove history, from the pursuit of a communist utopia in the 
Soviet Union to the Great Depression that propelled Hitler to power in Germany.

Beneath the centurya€™ s upheavals, DeLong sees a perennial tension between economic theorists 
Friedrich von Hayek, who anathematized state interference in free markets, and Karl Polanyi, who 
insisted that state intervention is needed to protect society from the disruptions of 
profit-maximizing market economies. (DeLong blames Hayekian market fundamentalism for dissuading 
the U.S. government from undertaking enough deficit spending to spur
recovery from the Great Recession of 2008.) The author conveys a wealth of information in elegant, 
accessible prose, combining grand, epochal perspectives with fascinating discursions on everything 
from alternating-current electricity to the gender wage gap. The result is a cogent interpretation 
of economic modernity that illuminates both its nigh-miraculous achievements and its seething 
discontents. (Sept.)a€!

Kirkus Reviews: SLOUCHING TOWARDS UTOPIA: An Economic History of the Twentieth Century; Author: J. 
Bradford DeLong'. A survey of the monumental transformations^ ’’and failed promisesaC ’’brought 
about by an extraordinary rise in prosperity.

DeLong, a Berkeley professor of economics, offers a sweeping account of economic history over the 
a€oelong twentieth centurya€Da€”1870 to 2010. Those years, he argues, were aCcethe most 
consequential years of all humanitya€™ s centuries,a€D in which a€oethe most important historical 
thread was what anyone would call the economic one, for it was the century that saw us end our 
near-universal dire material poverty.a€D

The booka€™ s a€oegrand narrativea€n charts how, in response to increased globalization and the 
development of modern research facilities and corporate business structures, wealth increased 
remarkably for a large proportion of the worlda€™ s population, prompting radical changes to 
long-standing social and political configurations. As the authora€™ s mix of close economic 
analyses and illustrative a€ce vignettes a€D demonstrates, this upsurge in
prosperity incited utopian dreams but repeatedly faileda€’’sometimes spectacularly a€”to realize 
them. At the end of the period in question, DeLong concludes, optimism about progress in 
eliminating extreme poverty and more equitably distributing wealth was at a low ebb, and faith in 
America as a leader in such efforts is in marked decline.

This is a lengthy text, and some of the chapters meander unnecessarily, but overall, the author 
ably anatomizes his subject with admirable clarity, offering accessible and illuminating 
explanations of key historical shifts and the socio-economic forces driving them. Among the most 
gripping and persuasive chapters are those that explain the acceleration of globalization in the 
late 19th century, the causes of the Great Depression (and what might have mitigated it),
and the origins and implications of the rise of neoliberalism at the end of the 20th century.

A sprawling but carefully argued, edifying account of modern economic history and its impact on 
global well-being.

Scientific induction has worked. So far. That does not mean that scientific induction in the 
corresponding worldview has any rational justification. But it does mean that it is the kind of 
thing that tends to evolve, and that if you, personally, deviate from it, you may find yourself, 
well, taking horse tranquilizer NOV an attempt to cure a dangerous respiratory virus, or 
participating in an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States by force and violence:

Cosma Shalizi: Review of Collins and Evans, Why Democracies Need Science: a€~What the late great 
anthropologist-philosopher Ernest Gellner sometimes called believing that a€oepositivism is right, 
for Hegelian reasonsa€D. Namely: world-views, and the ways of life which go along with them, have 
to be taken as more or less total packages .(a€oeFundamental changes transform identitiesa€D: 
Plough, Sword, and Book, p. 194.)
Precisely for this reason, attempts to find neutral criteria which could truly rationally compel 
someone to accept one such package over another have at best foundered on circularity. But some of 
those packages are a damn sight more attractive than others. The package which Gellner sometimes 
abbreviated as a€cepositivisma€D, where concepts are submitted to empirical control, where 
description and prescription are carefully
separated,   etc., etc. a€” in short, the scientific world-view a€” has proven to be an immensely 
attractive one, because it works in the world. It has transformed the ecology of humanity, and is 
(as he put it somewhere) visibly devouring every other form of society. At this level, we may have 
no option beyond a total choice without rational justification. It does not follow that we should 
accord deference to every enterprise which purports to
be  part of the larger scientific world-view, particularly when it is very shaky about things like 
whether its concepts actually refer to anything in experienced!

Yes. But what ideology does the Chinese communist party believe in these days? It is not anything I 
would call "Marxism" or "Socialism". Authoritarian state surveillance capitalism, with or without 
some egalitarian aspirations, is a difficult thing to maintain as an ideology. Or so I would think:

advantages and the value of the system, but lacked any other ideological coordinatesaC!. The lack 
of belief in the system stemmed from the
failure of the Soviet Union in the economic arena, and inability to propose a system of 
participation in the decision-making that appealed to, or was acceptable to, most of its 
populationa€!

Social democracy thought to reap the von Hayekian benefits of market economic coordination and also 
to rebalance social power by using redistributive programs to equalize the distribution of wealth. 
But forgive me if I am suspicious of a technocrat-free campaign to create a€oegood jobsa€D by 
flirting with ethno-nationalist currents:

Dani Rodrik: The New Productivism Paradigm?: a€~There are signs of a major reorientation toward an

To make Harold Wilson the principal villain responsible for our failure to advance towards utopia 
is, well, I guess you can call it an "ethos".:

Eric Hobsbawm (1978): The Forward March of Labour Halted?: a€~We now see a growing division of 
workers into sections and groups, each pursuing its own economic interests irrespective of the 
rest. What is new here is thata€! the strength of a group liesa€! in the inconvenience they can 
cause to the public, i.e. to other workers (e.g. by power-blackouts or whatever)a€!. For the first 
seventy years or so of the last century, Marx and
Engels would have been neither very surprised nor very disappointed by the tendencies of 
development in the British working class. Not very surprised, because the tendencies were such as 
they predicteda€! though I think they would have been a bit surprised by the speed with which the 
tertiary sector developed, though perhaps not so much by the formation of a new conservative 
white-collar labour aristocracy. They would not have
been very disappointeda€! because they did not expect very much from the British working classa€!.

No Housing Please, We're a Community

I received a really interesting, insightful comment on a subscribers-only piece from a few weeks 
ago, on the tension between community and continuity on the one hand, and development and growth on 
the other. I had mentioned in passing the right-wing meme a€oel will not live in a pod,a€D which 
refers to the supposed notion that liberals want to cram everyone ia€!

Why is there no democratic party infrastructure? Why is there only a network of semi-grifter 
consultants sending me panicked fundraising emails of which they get an excessive cut?

Micah Sifry: Messaging Wona€™ t Save Democrats; Community Might. a€~Populist economics: tax the 
rich, hammer corporations for price gouging and profiteering, bring jobs home, help small 
businesses against corporate monopolies are all themes that resonatea€!. Politics as it is 
practiced today, in the form of messaging wars on television and online, is just too far from most 
peoplea€™ s livesa€!. Candidates and party committees
should be spending time doing things like sponsoring community events like [Ohio Senator] Sherrod 
Browna€™ s a€~movie nightsa€™ a€! where the theme is to build community spirit and togetherness. Or 
they could set up events that were community health clinics where people come in and get health 
care assistance that they couldna€™ t otherwise afford. Or Chautauqua style eventsa€!. I dona€™ t 
think Democrats are likely to
shift  the tens of millions of dollars they now have slotted for expensive ad campaigns this fall 
into community fairs or mutual aid programs. Theya€™ re going to keep doing what theya€™ ve always 
done and pray for a different resulta€!

Most a€oeGrand Strategya€D courses would be vastly improved if they were turned over to the 
computer from the movie a€oeWar Gamesa€Da€”the one that says: a€oea very curious game: the only way 
to win is not to playa€C. That should be the threshold question for Grand Strategy:

Duck of Minerva: Strategies of Unusual Size: a€~Ia€™ m not a fan of the kind of highly stylized, 
slightly smug case studies that show up in standard grand-strategy readers. I can never decide what 
to do with them. I oscillate between a€oeStudents should read this material because it functions as 
background knowledge for some participants in these debatesaCD and a€oeNope. Absolutely not.a€Da€! 
I asked the students to identify the
most important threats to, variously, Washington, Beijing, Moscow, or the governments of other 
important powers. They overwhelmingly pointed to collective threats: climate change, pandemics, 
water scarcity, nuclear proliferation, and so on. This is a far cry from the topics that dominate 
standard grand-strategy syllabuses, including my own. Ita€™ s also almost certainly correcta€!

For M. Todd Henderson and J.B. Heaton to write a€oeDelaware courts have rarely ordered specific 
performance in merger agreementsa€!a€n when the now-Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ordered specific 
performance in a merger case just last-year would seem to be the declaration of two morons. But we 
do remember that M. Todd Henderson, in his younger days, did not understand what marginal tax rates 
were:

Matt Levine: I Was Told Therea€™ d Be a Cake Merger: a€~Money Stuff is going to be off for a few 
weeks starting tomorrow. I planned this before Elon Musk tried to cancel his Twitter deal, and I am 
not a monster, so there will be occasional columns as Musk or other news require. But it will not 
publish every daya€!. We might talk about an interesting Delaware Chancery Court decision from last 
Aprila€!. Kohlberg & Co., signed a
merger agreement to buy a company called DecoPaca€!. Then the Covida€‘T9 pandemic got worsea€! and 
Kohlberg a€oelost their appetite for the deal shortly after signing it.a€Da€!. They came up with 
three approachesa€! said that DecoPac had experienced a a€oematerial adverse effecta€D due to the 
decline in its business during the pandemica€!. had not complied with its covenant to a€oeoperate 
the Business in the Ordinary

Course of Businessa€Da€! took steps to blow up their financinga€!. This is important because the 
contract allowed DecoPac to seek specific performance^! only if a€oefull proceeds of the Debt 
Financing have been funded to Buyer.a€Da€! So Kohlberg canceled the deal and DecoPac sued. The vice 
chancellor was not amused by Kohlberga€™ s excusesa€!. Because there is no debt financing in place, 
the buyers argue that the court
may not grant specific performance. The court disagreesa€!. This decision deems the debt financing 
condition met because the buyers contributed materially to lack of debt financing by breaching 
their reasonable-best-efforts obligationa€!. This post-trial decision resolves all issues in favor 
of the seller and orders the buyers to close on the purchase agreement. On specific performance in 
particular, she wrotea€! a€oeThis court has not
hesitated to order specific performance in cases of this nature, particularly where sophisticated 
parties represented by sophisticated counsel stipulate that specific performance would be an 
appropriate remedy in the event of breach.a€Ua€! The deal closed in May 2021, a few weeks after her 
decision; I guess Kohlberg figured out its financinga€!

Scientific induction has worked. So far. That does not mean that scientific induction in the 
corresponding worldview has any rational justification. But it does mean that it is the kind of 
thing that tends to evolve, and that if you, personally, deviate from it, you may find yourself, 
well, taking horse tranquilizer NOV an attempt to cure a dangerous respiratory virus, or 
participating in an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States by force and violence:

Cosma Shalizi: Review of Collins and Evans, Why Democracies Need Science: a€~What the late great 
anthropologist-philosopher Ernest Gellner sometimes called believing that a€oepositivism is right, 
for Hegelian reasonsa€D. Namely: world-views, and the ways of life which go along with them, have 
to be taken as more or less total packages .(a€oeFundamental changes transform identitiesa€D: 
Plough, Sword, and Book, p. 194.)
Precisely for this reason, attempts to find neutral criteria which could truly rationally compel 
someone to accept one such package over another have at best foundered on circularity. But some of 
those packages are a damn sight more attractive than others. The package which Gellner sometimes 
abbreviated as a€cepositivisma€D, where concepts are submitted to empirical control, where 
description and prescription are carefully
separated,   etc., etc. a€” in short, the scientific world-view a€” has proven to be an immensely 
attractive one, because it works in the world. It has transformed the ecology of humanity, and is 
(as he put it somewhere) visibly devouring every other form of society. At this level, we may have 
no option beyond a total choice without rational justification. It does not follow that we should 
accord deference to every enterprise which purports to
be  part of the larger scientific world-view, particularly when it is very shaky about things like 
whether its concepts actually refer to anything in experienced!

Yes. But what ideology does the Chinese communist party believe in these days? It is not anything I 
would call "Marxism" or "Socialism". Authoritarian state surveillance capitalism, with or without 
some egalitarian aspirations, is a difficult thing to maintain as an ideology. Or so I would think:

Branko Milanovic: The Rule of Nihilists: a€~Xi Jinpinga€™ s January 2013 speech to the members of 
the Central Committee of CPCa€!. Xi sees the break-up of the Soviet Union and the end of the CPSU 
as the result of a€oeideological nihilisma€D: the ruling strata have ceased to believe in the 
advantages and the value of the system, but lacked any other ideological coordinatesaC!. The lack 
of belief in the system stemmed from the
failure of the Soviet Union in the economic arena, and inability to propose a system of 
participation in the decision-making that appealed to, or was acceptable to, most of its 
populationa€!

A friend sent me recently an abbreviated version of Xi Jinpinga€™ s January 2013 speech to the 
members of the Central Committee of CPC (the English translation is here). The speech is often 
mentioned, generally in the context of greater ideological control and a€oeauthoritarian 
tendenciesaCD of Xi Jinping, but I have not read it until I got it from hima€!

Social democracy thought to reap the von Hayekian benefits of market economic coordination and also 
to rebalance social power by using redistributive programs to equalize the distribution of wealth. 
But forgive me if I am suspicious of a technocrat-free campaign to create a€oegood jobsa€D by 
flirting with ethno-nationalist currents:

Dani Rodrik: The New Productivism Paradigm?: a€~There are signs of a major reorientation toward an 
economic policy framework that is rooted in production, work, and localism instead of finance, 
consumerism, and globalism. It might just turn into a new policy model that captures imaginations 
across the political spectruma€!. a€ceProductivisma€Da€! emphasizes the dissemination of productive 
economic opportunities throughout
all regions and all segments of the labor forcea€! departs from the Keynesian welfare state by 
focusing less on redistribution, social transfers, and macroeconomic management and more on 
supply-side measures to create good jobsa€! diverges from both of its antecedents by reflecting 
greater skepticism toward technocrats and expressing less knee-jerk hostility to economic 
populisma€!. Production, work, and localism instead of finance,
consumerism, and globalisma€!

To make Harold Wilson the principal villain responsible for our failure to advance towards utopia 
is, well, I guess you can call it an "ethos".:

Eric Hobsbawm (1978): The Forward March of Labour Halted?: a€~We now see a growing division of 
workers into sections and groups, each pursuing its own economic interests irrespective of the 
rest. What is new here is thata€! the strength of a group liesa€! in the inconvenience they can 
cause to the public, i.e. to other workers (e.g. by power-blackouts or whatever)a€!. For the first 
seventy years or so of the last century, Marx and
Engels would have been neither very surprised nor very disappointed by the tendencies of 
development in the British working class. Not very surprised, because the tendencies were such as 
they predicteda€! though I think they would have been a bit surprised by the speed with which the 
tertiary sector developed, though perhaps not so much by the formation of a new conservative 
white-collar labour aristocracy. They would not have
been very disappointeda€! because they did not expect very much from the British working classa€!. 
Like you and me, they would have been pretty contemptuous of the Labour leadership^!. It simply 
wona€™ t do to say that this crisis of the working class and the socialist movement was 
a€oeinevitablea€na€!. If we are to explain the stagnation or crisis, we have to look at the Labour 
Party and the labour movement itself. The
workers, and growing strata outside the manual workers, were looking to it for a lead and a policy. 
They didna€™ t get it. They got the Wilson yearsa€”and many of them lost faith and hope in the mass 
party of the working peoplea€!
