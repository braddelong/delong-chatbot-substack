The News: A Yet-Unbroken Chain

For thirty years, Americans have been wrestling with a still-unresolved question about the 
Internet. Did it simply expose ideas and sentiments that were already there to the view of a 
reading public that had previously been protected by a bristling wall of editors, publishers, and 
other gatekeepers? Did online media simply show us the truth about the rea€!

Paragraphs

I think the very sharp Timothy Burke misreads the situation we are in today, at least to some 
degree, at least to the extent that you draw from him some comfort from the idea that Replacement 
Theory is nothing new. In the past Replacement Theory had 3/8 of the political nation on its 
sidea€”half of the Republican Party and half of the southern wing of the Democratic Partya€”and was 
only able to pass legislation during the
temporary 1920s purge of Progressives. Today Replacement Theory has all of the Republican Party in 
its corner:

Timothy Burke: The News: A Yet-Unbroken Chain: a€~The public culture that thinks of itself as 
mainstream sensible American values and viewpoints has had to reckon with just how much of the 
country thinks otherwise and has thought otherwise for quite some timea€!. You can still see the 
archaeological fragments of this complacency in how pundits and politicians scramble to label the 
concept
of a€oereplacement theorya€da€l as an insane, extreme, marginal idea that was only available to the 
shooter due to the ungoverned and irresponsible character of online mediaa€!. This at least is 
historically wronga€!. Ita€™ s a rebranding of the kind of nativism that coalesced first around 
hostility to Irish immigration in the 1840s and then shaped electoral politics and policies aiming 
to restrict
residential and political rights of people already in the United States as well as new immigration 
throughout the 19th Century and into the 20th, up to the Immigration Act of 1924a€!

I really should not have to say this. Perhaps there will be thriving "web3a€D businesses in the 
future. But what incentive will those starting such future businesses ever have to give a 
substantial share of what they are doing to current first-generation crypto assets, rather than 
starting from fresh with third- or fourth- or nth-generation crypto assets which they can newly 
mint themselves?:

Quantum computing is possible: after all, photosynthesis depends on a€oequantum random walksa€D. 
Note that this is much more than a mere claim that quantum mechanics underpins biology. It is a 
claim that quantum-computing information transmission effects guide the flow of energy through a 
plant. But how possible? And how useful? My uninformed guess is that we would need a mature 
technology of near-room-
temperature superconductors before we could start taming unwanted decoherence enough for quantum 
computing to be a large-scale part of the economy:

Bryan Walsh: a€™I have watched the quantum computing space long enough to know that the worka€!

The problem is that Boris Johnsona€™ s business model is and always has been half lying, and half 
promise-breaking. And somehow I dona€™ t think the European Union will listen to Martin Wolfa€™ s 
plea to be merciful and kind to a Britain that is outside the tent pissing in. It is true that it 
would be much worse had Boris Johnson not a€oegot Brexit donea€C. In the counterfactual he is 
inside the tent pissing in.
There is logic and reason behind Wolfa€™ s claim that the European Union is better off, because 
Brexit is a€oehelping it to make far faster progress than it would have done if the UK had remained 
a member.a€D But I dona€™ t think that triggers the kind of gratitude that anyone will ever be able 
to take to the bank:

Martin Wolf: Johnson Must Embrace the Brexit He Made'. a€~Once again [Alexander Boris de Pfeffel 
Johnson] is planninga€! to repudiate parts of the UKa€™ s Brexit deala€! on which he campaigned. 
This would destroy the UKa€™ s reputation for keeping its word, invite a parallel EU repudiation of 
its free trade deal with the UK, enrage the Biden administration and divide the westa€!. After
the referendum, the Brexiters insisted that their narrow victory mandated them to choose the 
hardest possible Brexit, whatever its cost. They rejected the single market. They also repudiated 
Theresa Maya€™ s withdrawal agreementa€L Once in power, Johnson made his deal to a€oeget Brexit 
donea€D, the one he now wishes to change unilaterally. Then he said that a€oeNorthern Ireland has a 
great
deal. You keep free movement and access to the single market but you also have unfettered access to 
GB.a€Da€l In a recent speech justifying unilateral repudiation, Lord Frost, Johnsona€™ s 
negotiator, argued that a€oeThe detail of the protocola€™ s provisions was essentially imposed 
under duress because we had no a€~walk awaya€™ option.a€D As a matter of fact, we did. But it would 
have
been too costly to exercisea€!. The EU should also engage, recognising that Brexit has been helping 
it to make far faster progress than it would have done if the UK had remained a member. Gratitude 
for removal of this obstacle should encourage it to be conciliatorya€!. The UK has to keep its 
promises. This depressing version of Groundhog Day must now enda€!
