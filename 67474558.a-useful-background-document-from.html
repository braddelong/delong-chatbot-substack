The concept of “core” inflation—distinguishing between volatile prices, like food and energy, and slower-moving prices that have a lot of inertia—has been highly successful since the economist Robert Gordon introduced it in the 1970s.

Most consumers in our nationally representative panel data exhibit multiple biases, with substantial cross-person heterogeneity. Biases are positively correlated within person, especially after adjusting for measurement error. From that correlation structure, we reduce our 20 bias and standard preference measures to four behavioral common factors. Each BCF reflects a group of related biases re: beliefs, decision quality, discounting, or risk/uncertainty attitudes. The first two BCFs also strongly correlate with each other (positively) and cognitive skills (negatively). The first three BCFs and cognitive skills strongly correlate with various outcomes in the expected directions. Our results support processing-based models where basic limitations in cognition and/or attention produce multiple biases, and have several other implications for theory and practice…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.restud.com/paper/we-are-all-behavioral-more-or-less-a-taxonomy-of-consumer-decision-making/">https://www.restud.com/paper/we-are-all-behavioral-more-or-less-a-taxonomy-of-consumer-decision-making/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>WAIT?

Democrats do badly when the working class in the middle class concluded that growth is not equitable, and that they need to stomp on minorities who are getting more than their fair share—that social democracy seeks to treat people equally, and since people—minorities and such from the perspective of many, and working-class people from the perspective of many others—are unequal, that is a wrong and bad thing to do.

To counter GOP screams about raising taxes, Manchin says hikes will hit only the wealthy, noting that Wall Street has “been on a hell of a ride.” Manchin, you see, is only for rebalancing an economy badly unbalanced by elite rigging. And on climate, Manchin says he backs investment in the technologies of a greener future, but without an abrupt abandonment of fossil fuels…. This would be our biggest investment in our climate future ever….
