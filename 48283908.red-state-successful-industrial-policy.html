Not having a clue as to where the game even might be played.</p><p>It is not as though Republican politicians do not have people willing to work for them who could point them to where the game is. Consider Columbia’s <strong>Glenn Hubbard</strong> &lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wall-Bridge-Fear-Opportunity-Disruptions/dp/0300259085/">https://www.amazon.com/Wall-Bridge-Fear-Opportunity-Disruptions/dp/0300259085/</a>&gt;:</p><blockquote><p>Since September 1977… technological change and globalization have magnified the market value of my skills and… [other] professionals. Meanwhile, the closure of Youngstown’s integrated steel mills did not lead to moon-shot efforts toward the preparation and reconnection of many workers and communities…. Imagine if bold support for community colleges and training would match the preparation and reconnection of the G.I. Bill as America was encouraging global integration… bridge ideas… economic participation…. that generates an ever-increasing wealth of the nation.</p><p>Imagine mass flourishing.</p></blockquote><p>Now it is true that when Glenn  writes “we economists have let the public debate drift to the opposite extremes of building walls and a laissez-faire optimism about change and markets making everything OK”, my immediate reaction is that of Tonto to the Lone Ranger in the old joke: “what is this ‘we’, kemosabe?” But that I regard Glenn and company as late to the party does not mean that they are not capable of bringing plenty of refreshments with them. </p><p>However, what does he have to offer other than “bold support for community colleges and training”? That, plus tax cuts for the rich. Oh, and the political forces Glenn and company have allied themselves with always favor a cutting-back of broad-based social insurance because such egalitarian policies mean that somebody who their core voters regard as unequal to them might receive an equal amount of money.</p><p>There are huge, huge problems in running a successful economic developmental state in the modern world. The United States managed, somewhat, back when we were under the gun of sputnik and conservatives put maintaining social order and privilege behind gaining the economic and military strength to combat what they viewed as an existential threat. The countries of East Asia have managed—although I have questions about whether China's interior is managing. The club of post-World War II Marshall-Plan aid recipients, under the gun of Paul Hoffman's urging them to adopt policies that made his heavy lift of congressional approval for the next year's Marshall Plan funds possible, managed. But that is pretty much it in the modern world.</p><p>This I do not have a lot of confidence that my faction in American politics could do the job, even if its elbow were not being joggled constantly. Is there any reason to think that those to my right are not in much worse shape? I think the answer is “no”. And that is why they kept doubling-down on right-neoliberalism, even though neither Reagan nor Bushes had any effective policies to boost growth. Up until 2007, perhaps, they could argue that if their neoliberal bet had not paid off, at least it had not crapped out: Hyperglobalization and neoliberalism looked to have been superior to too much state-led development led by an anti-developmental state. And the high income and wealth inequality of the Second Gilded Age could be sold as a feature rather than a bug that would pay off eventually. But now it is clear, to Glenn at least, that something different is needed.</p><p>On the other hand, it can be done. I still think that Botswana is remarkable, and a sign that there should be considerable hope everywhere: Botswana, with an annual real income per capita estimated at $900 in 1960 and $14,000 in 2010, and the highest Human Development Index in sub-Saharan Africa, despite being landlocked, despite being severely affected by HIV/ AIDS, and  being in a very bad regional neighborhood growth-wise. Consider that neighbor Zambia’s income per capita went from $2,800 in 1960 to $3,500 in 2010, from three times Botswana’s to one-fourth of Botswana’s. </p><p>In Botswana, an independent and uncorrupt judicial system, a lack of tariffs on machinery imports (to encourage technology transfer), a banking system that encouraged savings, and a policy of plowing back government revenues into infrastructure investment all helped. So did the luck and the skill of the Tswana chiefs in the late 1800s in managing to guide the British Empire into ruling with a very light hand, which made post-independence state-building very easy. And the fact that Botswana’s population was about 80 percent Tswana, as was the leader of the independence movement and the first president of independent Botswana (1966–1980), Seretse Khama, kgosi (“king” or “chief”) of the Ngwato, one of the eight principal Tswana chieftaincies. </p><p>Not to mention that Botswana negotiated a 50 percent ownership interest in the country’s De Beers mining subsidiary, plus a 15 percent ownership stake in the overall De Beers corporation. </p><p>Nevertheless, any country, anywhere, anywhen, could have done it, if Botswana managed to do it.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Audio:</h2><p><strong>Sonia Purnell &amp; </strong><em><strong>al.</strong></em>: <em>OH GOD, WHAT NOW?

It's a strange mysterious Ghost Dog!</p><p><strong>Speaker #2:</strong> I love it. I love the Ghost Dog. Hold on, let me… no, I don't need to make myself more visible, I don't need to turn on front lighting, because we're not recording video. So who cares? Do you mind if I if I look like I'm in a cave? That's fine. After all, you are in a cave, aren't you? I mean, yes. And manmade sort of rectilinear cave.</p><p><strong>Speaker #1:</strong> Is this working?</p><p><strong>Speaker #1:</strong> Are we recording this afternoon? I just got a email asking this. But we are recording, like, right now. </p><p><strong>Speaker #2:</strong> Yes. </p><p><strong>Speaker #1:</strong> This is recording time. Good. Well…</p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p></p>
