Brad DeLong (2014): Making Sense of Friedrich A. von Hayek’. a€~One way to conceptualize it all is 
to think of it as the shape of a river:

The first current is the Adam Smith current, which makes the classical liberal bid: Smith claims 
that the system of natural liberty; with government restricted to the rule of law, infrastructure, 
defense, and education; is the best of all social arrangements.

This first current is then joined by the Karl Polanyi current: Polanyi says that, empirically, at 
least in the Industrial Age, the system of natural liberty fails to produce a good-enough society. 
The system of natural liberty turns land, labor, and finance into commodities. The market then 
moves them about the board in its typically disruptive fashion:
a€oeall that is solid melts into aira€D, or perhaps a€ reestablished and inherited social orders 
are steamed awaya€D. But land, finance, and labora€“these three are not real commodities. They are, 
rather, a€refictitious commoditiesa€n, for nobody wants their ability to earn a living, or to live 
where they grew up, or to start a business to be subject to
the disruptive wheel of market fortuna.

The social disruption produced by allowing the prices of these a€refictitious commoditiesa€n to be 
set by market forces is too great to be sustained. Politics will not allow it. And so a good 
society needs to regulate: A good society needs to regulate the market for land so that people are 
not thrown off of what they have good reason to regard as theirs
even if they lack the proper pieces of paper. A good society needs to regulate the market for 
finance in order to maintain full employment and price stability. A good society needs to regulate 
the market for labor to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to work at a living wage.

Thus we must move forward from classical liberalism to social democracy.

That is Karl Polanyia€™ s argument. And it is convincing. Classical liberalism supports and 
justifies economies that produce a great deal of unnecessary human misery: that seems very, very 
clear indeed by the time of the Great Depression. As John Maynard Keynes wrote in his 1926 essay, 
a€reThe End of Laissez Fairea€D, nineteenth and early
twentieth-century history teach one big lesson:

It is not true that individuals possess a prescriptive a€~natural libertya€™ in their economic 
activities. There is no a€~compacta€™ conferring perpetual rights on those who Have or on those who 
Acquire. The world is not so governed from above that private and social interest always coincide. 
It is not so managed here below
that in practice they coincide. It is not a correct deduction from the principles of economics that 
enlightened self-interest always operates in the public interest. Nor is it true that self-interest 
generally is enlightened; more often individuals acting separately to promote their own ends are 
too ignorant or too weak to attain even
these. Experience does not show that individuals, when they make up a social unit, are always less 
clear-sighted than when they act separately. We cannot therefore settle on abstract grounds, but 
must handle on its merits in detaila€! distinguish afresh the Agenda of government from the 
Non-Agenda; anda€! devise forms of
government within a democracy which shall be capable of accomplishing the Agendaa€!

Why then was classical liberalism so strong at the end of the nineteenth century? Keynesa€™ s view:

The early nineteenth centurya€! harmonised the conservative individualism of Locke, Hume, Johnson, 
and Burke with the socialism and democratic egalitarianism of Rousseau, Paley, Bentham, and 
Godwina€!. Nevertheless, that age would have been hard put to it to achieve this harmony of 
opposites if it had not been for the
economistsa€!. To the philosophical doctrine that the government has no right to interfere, and the 
divine that it has no need to interfere, there is added a scientific proof that its interference is 
inexpedienta€!. The corruption and incompetence of eighteenth-century government^! material 
progress between 1750 and 1850 came
from individual initiative, and owed almost nothing to the directive influence of organised 
societya€! the innovations of Darwina€!. The economists were teaching that wealth, commerce, and 
machinery were the children of free competition^“that free competition built London. But the 
Darwinians could go one better than
thata€“free competition had built mana€!. Socialist interferences became, in the light of this 
grander synthesis, not merely inexpedient, but impiousa€!.

These reasons and this atmosphere are the explanationsa€! why we feel such a strong bias in favour 
of laissez-fairea€!. We have not read these authorsa€!. Nevertheless we should nota€! think as we 
do, if Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Rousseau, Paley, Adam Smith, Bentham, and Miss Martineau had not 
thought and writtena€!. I
have said that it was the economists who furnished the scientific doctrine by which the practical 
man could solve the contradiction between egoism and socialisma€!. I hasten to qualifya€!. It is 
what the popularisers and the vulgarisers saida€!. The popularity of the doctrine must be laid at 
the door of the political philosophers
of the day, whom it happened to suit, rather than of the political economistsa€!

Classical liberalisma€“laissez-fairea€“was a mighty intellectual current. But empirical reality was 
mightier still, especially in the form of the Great Depression. And so the main channel became 
social democracy. And so, I think, it remains today.


But as the river entered its delta, it did spread out. There are three other channels in the delta 
besides Polanyi-style social democracy: call them Leninism, Keynesianism, and Hayekism:

(1) Lenin says the social democracy or democratic socialism is unstable. The bourgeoisie is 
hegemonic. It will turn the mechanisms of the democratic state to its own purposes. What is needed 
is aggressive communism to exterminate the bourgeoisie as a class. Only after the aristos and the 
bourgeoisie and the hep-men and the kulaks and the careerist
bureaucrats have been eliminated can a properly-good society be built.

(2) Keynes says that we really need much less social democracy (or democratic socialism) than the 
main Polanyi current believes. Simply stabilize aggregate demand at a high level via clever central 
bank financial engineering, and people will not mind that the market treats the a€oefictitious 
commoditiesa€D like commodities. Moreover, the taste­
making and the thrift-promoting virtues of the bourgeoisie sitting at the top of a fairly-steep 
socioeconomic pyramid are a feature, not a bug, for a good society.

(3) Hayek says that the problem with classical liberalism was that it was not pure enough. The 
government needed to restrict itself to establishing the rule of law and to using antitrust to 
break up monopolies. It was the overreach of the government beyond those limits, via central 
banking and social democracy, that caused all the trouble. A democratic
government needs to limit itself to rule of law and antitrusta€“and perhaps soup kitchens and 
shelters. And what if democracy turns out not to produce a government that limits itself to those 
activities? Then, Hayek says, so much the worse for democracy. A Pinochet is then called for to, in 
a Lykourgan moment, minimalize the state. After social
democracy   has been leveled and the rubble cleared away, thena€“perhapsa€“a limited range of 
issues can be discussed and debated by aa€“limiteda€ “restored democracy, with some kind of group 
of right-wing army officers descended from latifundistas Council of Guardians in the background to 
ensure that property remains sacred and protected, and
the government small enough to fit in a bathtub.

And as you study the thought of Hayek, recognized that there are three very different and distinct 
subcurrents reinforcing, opposing, and confusing each other:

(a) The Good Economist Hayek is the thinker who has mind-blowing insights into just why the 
competitive market system is such a marvelous societal device for coordinating our by now 7.2 
billion-wide global division of labor. Few other economists imagined that Lenina€™ s 
centrally-planned economy behind the Iron Curtain was doomed to settle
at a level of productivity 1/5 that of the capitalist industrial market economies outside. Hayek 
did so imagine. And Hayek had dazzling insights as to why. Explaining the thought of this Hayek 
requires not sociology or history of thought but rather appreciation, admiration, and respect for 
pure genius.

(b) The Bad Economist Hayek is the thinker who was certain that Keynes had to be wrong, and that 
the mass unemployment of the Great Depression had to have in some mysterious way been the fault of 
some excessively-profligate government entity (or perhaps of those people excessively clever with 
money a€ “fractional-reserve bankers, and those
who claim not the natural increase of flocks but rather the interest on barren gold). Why Hayek 
could not see with everybody elsea€“including Milton Friedmana€“that the Great Depression proved 
that Saya€™ s Law was false in theory, and that aggregate demand needed to be properly and 
delicately managed in order to make Saya€™ s Law true in
practice is largely a mystery. Nearly everyone else did: the Lionel Robbinses and the Arthur 
Burnses quickly marked their beliefs to market after the Great Depression and figured out how to 
translate what they thought into acceptable post-World War II Keynesian language. Hayek never did.

My hypothesis is that the explanation is theology: For Hayek, the market could never fail. For 
Hayek, the market could only be failed. And the only way it could be failed was if its apostles 
were not pure enough.
The structure of the argument is familiar: We first see it in the syllogism:

YHWH had promised victory to his people Israel if they were faithful.
We tried to be faithful.

Here we are captive in Babylon.

Clearly we were not faithful enough to YHWH.

We need to strive much harder to be more faithful to YHWH in the future.

But that the argument is familiar to us all does not make it right.

And, indeed, right now as I am opening my mail I find, from the President of the Cato Institute:

—CHARLES KOCH. Chairman and CEO, Koch Industries, Inc.

WHY PURE CAPITALISM IS THE
WORLD ECONOMY’S ONLY HOPE


THE

FINANCIAL CRISIS

AND THE

FREE MARKET
CURE

How Destructive Banking Reform


JOHN A. ALLISON

a€ cePure capitalisma€ □.

Impure capitalism, you see, doesna€™ t work.

The blurb from Charles Koch is: a€oeRequired readinga€!. Shows how our economic crisis was a 
failure, not of the free market, but of government.a€D
Enough said?

(c) The Political Economist Hayek is the founder of the Mont Pelerin Society, who sets as his 
post-World War II lifetime task the rollback of social democracy. That is the Hayek who, we think, 
urges Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s to pull a Pinochet in Britain on the Labour Party and the 
United Mine Workers. She answers him thus:

The progression from Allendea€™ s Socialism to the free enterprise capitalist economy of the 1980s 
is a striking example of economic reform from which we can learn many lessons. However, I am sure 
you will agree that, in Britain with our democratic institutions and the need for a high degree of 
consent, some of the
measures adopted in Chile are quite unacceptable. Our reform must be in line with our traditions 
and our Constitution. At times the process may seem painfully slow. But I am certain we shall 
achieve our reforms in our own way and in our own timea€!

The original letter from Hayek appears to be missing from the places it should be. I suspect it was 
a real doozy.

With respect to this Hayek, I believe that three important questions naturally suggest themselves: 
Why the urgency of the task? Why the certainty of the aim? WTF with democracy and Pinochet?

Why the urgency of the task? The post-World War II world outside of the Iron Curtain sees 
remarkable prosperity: rapid growth, the egalitarian distribution, an increase in the human 
freedoms along nearly every dimension. The post-World War II social democracies are neither 
bureaucracies that stifle enterprise and produce economic stagnation nor
murderous Jacobins. To the east across the Iron Curtain remains the great grave threat of Stalin. 
Why not declare a domestic political truce in the west and focus on the Cold War?

The answer, I think, is that how you really believe that social democracy was The Road to Serfdoma€ 
“that German social democracy had led to Weimar which led to Hitler by sapping the love of liberty 
and independence of the people, and that the same process was already well into train in the 
Anglo-Saxon democracies. Why Hayek thought this as
decade after decade went by with no great upward leaps in the degree of central planning after 
Attleea€™ s prime Minister ship is not at all clear. What is clear is that he greeted the 
stagflation of the 1970s as evidence that he had been completely right all along.

Perhaps it was Hayeka€™ s social conservatism allowed him to be confident that he was right even 
during the days of prosperity in the 1950s and 1960s. Uppity Negroes, uppity women, uppity 
hippiesa€“all, to him, signs of deep moral and spiritual decay that by the logic of The Road to 
Serfdom had to bring economic and then political catastrophe in
their train. But this is speculation.

Why the certainty of the aim? this, I think, is clear. Hayek was not a believer in technocracy. For 
Hayek, the government would always be the tool of the ruling class. The ruling class might, 
briefly, be the envious poor who would destroy the economy by confiscating entrepreneurial wealth 
and then sharing it out. The ruling class might be the
monopolists. The ruling class might be the a€oeNew Classa€n of anti-entrepreneurial do-gooder 
social-worker types. In any case, the results of giving the government more power would be bad. 
Much better to limit the government to establishing the rule of law and breaking up private 
monopolies via antitrust. (And Hayeka€™ s students would
quickly ditch that last part.)

But in addition there is a fourth possible ruling class: one modeled after the Habsburg aristocracy 
that ruled the land in which Hayek was born.

WTF with democracy and Pinochet? it is very clear that Hayek was very comfortable saying that he 
would much rather have an authoritarian classical-liberal government then a democratic government 
that followed a€oeilliberala€n economic policies. But where are these authoritarians respect the 
rule of law supposed to come from? Why should
governments that do not respect the lives of their peoplea€“that throw people out of helicopters 
into the South Pacifica€“or the liberty of their peoplea€“that a€oedisappeara€D critics who cross 
the line and are too stridenta€ “respect the property of their people? Both theoretical and 
empirical considerations would tend to teach the lesson respect for
the   rule of law is a seamless garment: governments committed to respecting free speech and free 
elections would seem to be much more likely to commit themselves to respecting property than those 
that did not. Yet Hayek does not see it in the way I would regard as natural. Why not?

The natural place to look is, I think, to recognize that Hayek was not born on the shores of the 
North Atlantic. The North Atlantica€™ s dictatorsa€“Adolf Hitler, Francisco Franco, Vidkun 
Quisling, Philippe Petain, Antonio Salazara€“are none of them prizes. But Hayek was formed in 
Austria. From his perspective the property and enterprise
respecting Imperial Habsburg government of Franz Josef eager to make no waves, to hold what it has, 
and to keep the lid off the pressure cooker appears not unattractive. This is especially so when 
you contrasted would be really existing authoritarian alternatives: anti-Semitic populist demagogue 
mayors of Vienna; nationalist Serbian or Croatian
politicians interested in maintaining popular legitimacy by waging class war or ethnic war; 
separatists who seek independence and then one man, one vote, one time. An a€oeauthoritariana€D 
after the manner of Franz Josef looks quite attractive in this contexta€“and if you convince 
yourself but they are as dedicated to small government neoliberalism
as                                                                                                  
                                                              you are, and that the Lykourgan 
moment of the form will be followed by soft rule and popular assent, so much the better. And if the 
popular assent is not forthcoming? Then Hayek can blame the socialists, and say it is their fault 
for not understanding how good a deal they are offered.
