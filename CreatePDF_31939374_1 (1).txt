I sit in one of the dives
On Fifty-second Street
Uncertain and afraid

As the clever hopes expire
Of a low dishonest decade:

Waves of anger and fear
Circulate over the bright

And darkened lands of the earth,
Obsessing our private lives;

The unmentionable odour of death
Offends the September night.

Accurate scholarship can
Unearth the whole offence
From Luther until now

That has driven a culture mad,
Find what occurred at Linz,
What huge imago made

A psychopathic god:

I and the public know

What all schoolchildren learn,
Those to whom evil is done
Do evil in return.

Exiled Thucydides knew
All that a speech can say
About Democracy,

And what dictators do,

The elderly rubbish they talk
To an apathetic grave;
Analysed all in his book,

The enlightenment driven away,
The habit-forming pain,
Mismanagement and grief:

We must suffer them all again.

Into this neutral air

Where blind skyscrapers use
Their full height to proclaim
The strength of Collective Man,
Each language pours its vain
Competitive excuse:

But who can live for long
In an euphoric dream;

Out of the mirror they stare,
Imperialisma€™ s face

And the international wrong.

Faces along the bar

Cling to their average day:

The lights must never go out,
The music must always play,
All the conventions conspire
To make this fort assume
The furniture of home;

Lest we should see where we are,
Lost in a haunted wood,

Children afraid of the night

Who have never been happy or good.

The windiest militant trash
Important Persons shout

Is not so crude as our wish:

What mad Nijinsky wrote
About Diaghilev

Is true of the normal heart;
For the error bred in the bone
Of each woman and each man
Craves what it cannot have,
Not universal love

But to be loved alone.

From the conservative dark
Into the ethical life

The dense commuters come,
Repeating their morning vow;
a€cel will be true to the wife,

Ia€™ 11 concentrate more on my work,a€D
And helpless governors wake

To resume their compulsory game:
Who can release them now,

Who can reach the deaf,

Who can speak for the dumb?

All I have is a voice
To undo the folded lie,

The romantic lie in the brain

Of the sensual man-in-the-street
And the lie of Authority

Whose buildings grope the sky:
There is no such thing as the State
And no one exists alone;

Hunger allows no choice


We must love one another or die.

Defenceless under the night
Our world in stupor lies;
Yet, dotted everywhere,
Ironic points of light

Flash out wherever the Just
Exchange their messages:

May I, composed like them
Of Eros and of dust,
Beleaguered by the same
Negation and despair,
Show   an affirming flame.
