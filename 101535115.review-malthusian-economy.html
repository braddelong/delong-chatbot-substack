Herding and agriculture were really good ideas. 2000 years after -8000 our population has multiplied perhaps 2.5-fold. Not only was farmed land productive and herded animals tasty, it was also that living was easier when you were sedentary or semi-sedentary: you no longer had to carry babies substantial distances, and you could accumulate more useful stuff than you could personally carry. Plus even early agriculture and herding were very productive relative to what had come before. Since life was easier, more babies survived to grow up and themselves reproduce. Thus by -6000 we were, in the main, (poor) agriculturalists and (unsophisticated) herders, with a human population of perhaps 7 million. </p><p>However, the cup of agriculture and herding was in some respects poisoned. If we think of gatherer-hunters as living at an average of something like $3.50 a day, agriculturalists typically have lower living standards: perhaps $2.50 a day.</p><p>Why a fall in the standard of living? Because with more food population grew until it could grow no further—the 2.5-fold increase. What kept it from growing further? The fact that life became  harder than it had been in the early agricultural generations. But life became harder in a different way than life was hard for those living the strenuous and dangerous life of gatehrer hunters. Agriculturalists are shorter—figure about four inches, 10 centimeters—malnourished, prone to endemic diseases, and vulnerable to plagues relative to gatherer-hunters. Jared Diamond believes—or at least whoever wrote the title of his article believes—that the invention of agriculture was, as the title says, a bad mistaker: humans would be better-off had we remained gatherer-hunters.</p><p>After the Neolithic Revolution technological progress—the discovery, invention, development, deployment, and diffusion of useful and valuable ideas about how to manipulate nature and organize humans—appears to have been at a rate of about 0.018% per year from -6000 to -3000, the end of the Stone and the start of the Literacy and Bronze Age. In the Bronze and then the Iron Age agriculture, craftwork, organization, literacy, and more advance civilization faster: from -3000 to -1000, and then from -1000 BC to the year 1, we see H rise at first 0.03% per year, and then 0.06% per year, with a year-150 human population of 200 million. Then at least half of that year-150 population was collected in three great empires—Roman, Parthian, and Han—enforcing imperial peace, and together spanning Eurasia from what is now Vladivostok to Cadiz and from Hainan to Scotland. A huge change from the 7.5 million of -6000. But, still a typical living standard of $2.50 a day. And, indeed, things were much the same up to 1500: then a population of perhaps 480 million; then a much richer and more luxurious élite; but then the same typical living standard of roughly $2.50 a day.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Malthusian Equilibrium</h3><p>Human economy and society was then in a <em>Malthusian Equilibrium</em>: a vast tenfold improvements in technological and organizational capabilities from -6000 to 1500, from out H-index 0.04 to 0.43; but virtually all of that improvement going to support a 70-fold increase in human population.</p><p>In this long Agrarian Age of <em>Malthusian equilibrium</em> most people were close to the edge of subsistence, in the sense that had the population been even moderately poorer, the population would not have managed to reproduce itself in the next generation: too many women would have missed ovulation from malnutrition, too many malnourished children with compromised immune systems would have been taken out by the common cold, and too little sanitation made it a truly golden age for plague and dysentery.</p><p>Consider: a preindustrial pre-artificial birth-control population that is nutritionally unstressed will triple in numbers every 50 years or so. That was the experience of the <em>conquistadores</em> and their descendants in Latin America. That was the experience of the English and French settlers coming in behind the waves of plague and genocide that had decimated the indigenous Amerindian population in North America. That was the experience of the Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian settlers on the Pontic-Caspian steppe, after the armies of the gunpowder empires, most notably of Yekaterina II Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov (neé Sophie),Tsarina of All the Russias, drove out the horse nomads and opened the black-earth regions to the plow.</p><p>But back in the Agrarian Age it took the human population not 50 but 1500 years to triple. Is there anything that parents would work harder for and spend more effort on than trying to ensure that their children would survive to in their turn reproduce? Yet they could not do so, at least not to any extent to make the rate of population growth more than glacial. The fact that, in the Agrarian Age, human populations took not 50 but 1500 years to triple a measure of how poor, in the sense of being extraordinarily close to a biological population-sustaining limit humanity was back then.</p><p>Agrarian-Age historical patterns do appear to fit the Malthusian model. Under conditions of great nutritional stress, no artificial birth control and high infant mortality, families are desperate to have as many children as sociologically possible. They need to increase the chances that at least one son will survive to to care for them in their old age, should they attain one, and to carry on their memory. Thus a richer economy sees a higher rate of population growth. Given the absolutely glacial rate of technological progress and the discovery and deployment of ideas—maybe a 5% increase in the value of ideas over a century—the resulting increase in population causes resource scarcity: smaller farm sizes. That pushes the standard of living down, until women stop ovulating regularly and children's immune systems are so compromised that they are carried off by the common cold.</p><p></p><h3>Malthusian History Not Static</h3><p>What kinds of things can happen to a Malthusian economy?</p><p>Analytic geometry: Describe the economy as two numbers (population, productivity); represent that number-pair as a point; think of changes over time in those numbers as movement over time of the point</p><p>Last time we had a constant level of “subsistence”, and saw two kinds of patterns and processes at work:</p><ul><li><p>Transitory fluctuations up-and-left and down-and-right around the Malthusian equilibrium (orange): M.M. Postan’s “respiration”.</p></li><li><p>Slow rightward drift (green) as technology slowly advances, and population grows at the constant near-subsistence level of productivity and living standards.</p></li></ul><p>But we can think of more:</p><ul><li><p>Permanent increase (decrease) in required-subsistence: up-and-left (red)</p></li><li><p>Permanent increase (decrease) in taste-for-luxuries: up-and-left (blue)</p></li><li><p>Permanent increase (decrease) in security and profitability and thus in savings-investment: rightward (black)</p></li></ul><p>And recognize that these three can and do accompany each other, in various combinations:</p><ul><li><p>Rise of an empire?</p></li><li><p>Rise of a commercial network?</p></li><li><p>Successful barbarian invasion?</p></li><li><p>Religious transformation?</p></li></ul><p>And recognize that these shifts, although permanent, can be undone—or reinforced:</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Theory of the Malthusian Economy: Efflorescences &amp; Dark Ages</h3><p>If this were a different course, we would spend a week or more probably two building an economic model of how a society in Malthusian equilibrium works in terms of trends and fluctuations in population, typical living standards, domination, and élite consumption. This is not that course. So I simply present you with the bottom-line end-point of that model construction process:</p><p>y∗mal=ϕysub(1+γh/β)</p><p>Lt∗malR=[(Htysub)(sδ)θ(1ϕ)[1(1+γh/δ)θ1(1+γh/β)]]γ</p><p>The first equation gives the society’s Malthusian-equilibrium level of average productivity and living standards on the left-hand side. It is equal to:</p><ol><li><p>A parameter ɸ that represents how large a share of production is devoted to “luxuries” that do not make the population more fit to reproduce itself. For example, if the exploitative élite takes half of production for itself, then ɸ=2. And if in addition the exploitative élite has a taste for living and making their servants and suppliers live in cities—because pre-modern cities are disease-ridden, and so people need better nutrition to survive and reproduce in them—ɸ would be marked up even more. And if the civilization has a structure that allows for luxury consumption to trickle down to the commons, that would mark up ɸ as well.</p></li><li><p>The level <em><strong>y^{sub}</strong></em> of consumption of subsistence good needed for the population to stay stable on average.</p></li><li><p>An additional term—very close to one, with little impact on the society’s level of prosperity—creating a wedge between the actual average productivity level and the productivity level at which average population growth is zero. In a Malthusian economy, on average, productivity has to be high enough to generate enough population growth to produce the additional resource scarcity to offset the effects on living standards of better technology.</p></li></ol><p>But (1) and (2) are the big enchiladas here: the wedge between spending on “necessaries” that boost reproductive fitness on the one hand and total production on the other; and the sociological institutions that potentially reduce fertility by delaying marriage or increase mortality through female infanticide or other forms of violence,</p><p>The second equation gives the Malthusian-equilibrium level of population. It is:</p><ol><li><p>Proportional to the society’s resources R.</p></li><li><p>Grows as the society’s level of technology <em><strong>H</strong></em> increases over time as a multiple of the subsistence level of necessities consumption <em><strong>y^{sub}</strong></em> of consumption of subsistence good needed for the population to stay stable on average.</p></li><li><p>Grows to the extent that a <em><strong>pax imperia</strong></em> and other peace-creating and pro-trade institutions encourage the rate <em><strong>s</strong></em> at which the society saves and invests, relative to the rate <em><strong>δ</strong></em> at which investments wear out and depreciate.</p></li><li><p>And the importance of factor (3) depends on the salience <em><strong>θ</strong></em> of investment and capital relative to ideas in generating productivity.</p></li><li><p>Is inversely proportional to our index <em><strong>φ</strong></em> of the share of production devoted to “luxuries”.</p></li><li><p>There are two small nuisance terms we will ignore.</p></li><li><p>And this whole thing depends on the salience <em><strong>ɣ</strong></em> of ideas relative to natural resources in generating productivity.</p></li></ol><p>This second equation is a mindful. Think of it this way: The saliences <em><strong>θ</strong></em> and <em><strong>ɣ</strong></em> give us the balance of importance between ideas, saving and investment, and population growth that produces resource scarcity. The slowly-growing level of technology <em><strong>H</strong></em> imparts an upward drift to population over time. A higher savings rate <em><strong>s</strong></em> boosts and a higher luxuries index <em><strong>φ</strong></em> reduces the equilibrium population. And the society’s average level of productivity is boosted by a higher luxury index <em><strong>φ</strong></em> and by sociological institutions that raise the level of necessities consumption <em><strong>y^{sub} </strong></em>required to keep the population reproducing itself.</p><p><em><strong>H</strong></em> grows slowly over time.</p><p><em><strong>s</strong></em>, <em><strong>φ</strong></em>, and <em><strong>y^{sub} </strong></em>shift from place to place and from time to time, and their shifts—or, rather, the shifts in the factors that determine them—generate the rise and fall, the flourishing and poverty, the efflorescences and the dark ages of pre-modern agrarian-age civilizations.</p><p>As Jack Goldstone writes:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Jack Goldstone</strong> (2002): <em>Efflorescences and Economic Growth in World History: Rethinking the "Rise of the West" and the Industrial Revolution</em>&lt;<a href="https://delong.typepad.com/efflorescences_and_economic_growth_in_world_histor.pdf">https://delong.typepad.com/efflorescences_and_economic_growth_in_world_histor.pdf</a>&gt;: ‘Well before the Industrial and French revolutions… societies and economies departed from the ideal-typical view of "feudal" economically and technologically stagnant agrarian societies dominated by a predatory elite that wasted all surpluses…. Urban networks… combined management of urban and rural market-oriented craft production... with… flourishing… global trade; and from at least the sixteenth century national rulers brought their unruly agrarian elites to heel by building bureaucratized central ("absolutist") governments that provided a rule of law and framework for the protection and accumulation of private property and capital...</p><p>Let me propose... ‘efflorescence’… as the opposite of ‘crisis’… a relatively sharp, often unexpected upturn... usually accompanied by political expansion and institution building and cultural synthesis and consolidation.. involv[ing] both Smithian and Schumpeterian growth... often seen by contemporaries or successors as 'golden ages'... often set[ting] new patterns for thought, political organization, and economic life that last for many generations.... Golden Age Holland, Mediæval Northwestern Europe, the High Qing… Eighteenth-Century England…. Such efflorescences, however, tended to set new institutional and economic frameworks which themselves developed into an equilibrium or inertial state, in which new technological innovations slowed or ceased, and economic and political elites sought to defend existing social patterns. Such inertial states were prone to decay, Malthusian stresses (which were temporarily lifted during efflorescences), and the collapse of complexly interwoven economic and political structures…</p></blockquote><p>An “efflorescence” is, in our model, a jump-up in <em><strong>ɸ</strong></em>, in a society’s taste for luxuries, and an increase in <em><strong>s</strong></em>, in savings and investment. We are going to look at two such. Classical Greece, and then Republican and Imperial Rome. (If I were Melissa Dell, I would add the Maya. But I still do not know enough about the Maya.)</p><div><hr></div><h3>Early Iron-Age Greece</h3><p>Perhaps 300,000 people who called themselves “Hellenes” in the year -800 became perhaps 4 million in the year -300. And that was only the appetizer. Thereafter, following in the wake of the armies of Alexander the Great, and then the expansion of the Roman Empire to the Danube River, Greeks colonized city after city and spread out into the countryside from the Al-Fayyum oasis in Egypt to the Punjab, and from Alexandria Eschate near modern-day Tashkent to Marseilles in France. Houses got bigger—a lot bigger. Trade and the division of labor flourished.</p><p>Alongside the extraordinary growth of the Greek population is a remarkable increase in the average age of death among adults. There appears to be much less violence inflicted upon adults—either through violence directly applied, or through violence depriving adults of the resources that they need to keep living.</p><p>What do I mean by “less violence”? Consider what Odysseus says in the <em>Odyssey</em> about what he and the soldiers he commanded <em>after</em> the Trojan War was over, immediately after he and the twelve ships of Ithaka departed the shore:</p><p><em>Edit &amp; enter LaTeX expressions here</em></p><p>At the moment when he says this, Odysseus has just been washed up, a castaway, in the land of the Phaiakia. They ask him how he got there. And the story he tells them is that he is a pirate. It is, moreover, a pirate who keeps pirating. When Odysseus leaves Troy, he has just finished fighting the long and brutal Trojan War. He and his crew have their plunder from Troy. Yet the first thing they do is pirate. Plus they are rather stupid and undisciplined about pirating. In such an environment, is anybody going to save and invest a lot? Or, rather, is anybody going to save and invest in anything other than weapons and weapons training both to (a) make you and yours a hard and difficult target for the pirates, and (b) make yourself more effective when you go pirate? The economy’s ratio of savings to depreciation s/δ&nbsp; is surely going to be low, depressing the population.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b038477-d3aa-41d6-92b3-b098dae57d3e_1172x742.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b038477-d3aa-41d6-92b3-b098dae57d3e_1172x742.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b038477-d3aa-41d6-92b3-b098dae57d3e_1172x742.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b038477-d3aa-41d6-92b3-b098dae57d3e_1172x742.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b038477-d3aa-41d6-92b3-b098dae57d3e_1172x742.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8b038477-d3aa-41d6-92b3-b098dae57d3e_1172x742.png" width="1172" height="742" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8b038477-d3aa-41d6-92b3-b098dae57d3e_1172x742.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:742,&quot;width&quot;:1172,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;---econ-135-S2022_key.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;---econ-135-S2022_key.png&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="---econ-135-S2022_key.png" title="---econ-135-S2022_key.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b038477-d3aa-41d6-92b3-b098dae57d3e_1172x742.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b038477-d3aa-41d6-92b3-b098dae57d3e_1172x742.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b038477-d3aa-41d6-92b3-b098dae57d3e_1172x742.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b038477-d3aa-41d6-92b3-b098dae57d3e_1172x742.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Moreover, the risk that, as you mind your own business, Odysseus and company, well-trained, well-equipped, battle-hardened, will come along and, just because they can, “stormed that place and killed the men who fought. Plunder we took, and we enslaved the women…”—such high risks of violent death must, in Malthusian equilibrium, be offset by reduced mortality risk from disease and such. Hence the economy’s level of subsistence-necessities consumption will also be high. That also depresses the population.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68f2b286-a8a0-4070-adfe-686188e633b0_1172x742.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68f2b286-a8a0-4070-adfe-686188e633b0_1172x742.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68f2b286-a8a0-4070-adfe-686188e633b0_1172x742.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68f2b286-a8a0-4070-adfe-686188e633b0_1172x742.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68f2b286-a8a0-4070-adfe-686188e633b0_1172x742.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/68f2b286-a8a0-4070-adfe-686188e633b0_1172x742.png" width="1172" height="742" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/68f2b286-a8a0-4070-adfe-686188e633b0_1172x742.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:742,&quot;width&quot;:1172,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;---econ-135-S2022_key_1.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;---econ-135-S2022_key_1.png&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="---econ-135-S2022_key_1.png" title="---econ-135-S2022_key_1.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68f2b286-a8a0-4070-adfe-686188e633b0_1172x742.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68f2b286-a8a0-4070-adfe-686188e633b0_1172x742.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68f2b286-a8a0-4070-adfe-686188e633b0_1172x742.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68f2b286-a8a0-4070-adfe-686188e633b0_1172x742.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Not in the model, but potentially very real: A low population density means that ideas that are known and deployed somewhere will have a difficult time diffusing throughout a civilization. A low population density means that the “Smithian” productivity gains from using those ideas to build an extensive and highly productive division of labor will be difficult to attain.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Classical Greece Rising: Institutions</h3><p>Yet from this Early Iron-Age Dark-Age beginning after the collapse of the high Mycenaean civilization of the Late Bronze Age, the Greek peoples built a civilization.</p><p>As Josiah Ober has written, the Greeks moved out of:</p><blockquote><p>the violence and gift-exchange economy that characterized what Finley (1965) famously called “the world of Odysseus”….&nbsp; There was in fact sustained and substantial growth in the Greek economy between the ages of Homer and of Plato and Aristotle… driven by (1) efficient methods of production, predicated on relative advantage and aimed at increasing the quantity as well the quality of goods produced, and (2) by market exchanges based on voluntary contracts. Moreover, the rational Greek state (notably, but not exclusively Athens) was increasingly cognizant—through its legislative, judicial, and administrative functions (ch. 5)—of the social (and taxable) value of providing rules and infrastructure aimed at facilitating the profitable production and exchange of goods…. Ancient Greeks, as individuals and collectives, frequently employed economic rationality, i.e. rationally instrumental reasoning in economic contexts….</p></blockquote><p>All-in-all, this appears to be a remarkable civilizational accomplishment, and not one limited to the enrichment of a luxurious predatory upper class. There is a reason that the Greeks have a predominant place in our cultural memory. That reason is not that they are "our" ancestors, whoever "we" happened to be. The people who decided that universities should study the Greeks lived on the island of Britain, in the upper Thames river valley near Oxford and in the fins of Norfolk near Cambridge. They were in nowise descendants, biologically or culturally, of the ancient Greeks. Nobody in England in 1450 could speak or read Greek. Yet the inhabitants of the valley and the fens adopted them as their predecessors in what they decided to call “western civilization”.</p><p>Emerging out of the Iron “Dark Age” of -1200 to -800, the Greeks built a unique institutional framework: the city-state. It emerged with functional systems of governance which provided public goods—security, boundary stones, marketplaces, mediators, dispute resolution. This initiated a period of sustained increases in living standards.</p><p>Now do not overstate the accomplishment. While Ancient Greece did have a period of democracy, it was relative short (less than 200 years) compared to the duration of the polities. Even during Greece’s Democratic Age, most <em>poleis</em> remained oligarchies. And remember! Most citizens—slaves, poor citizens who couldn’t afford their tax bill, women—could not participate even in smallholder democracy. The Greek rules according to which the society was organized tended to be “extractive”—at least if you were not one of the <em>equals</em> who were full citizens. And the economy was largely based upon slavery. (Do note, however, that with some notable exceptions like the Spartan <em>helots</em> and the Athenian and Syracusan mines), this slavery was small-scale rather than plantation slavery: it was ripping somebody out of their social context and placing them in a position in which they had no family or other trusted companions to provide them with any social power.)</p><p>At and near its peak, the civilization had astonishing creative achievements. Look at the people of ancient classical civilization. In rhetoric and politics, we have Perikles and Cicero. In generalship, should we have Cæsar and Alexander. In governance? We have Augustus and Trajan. In philosophy we have Aristotle and Plato. In sculpture and literature we have Praxiteles and Sophokles. They are our equal, even though they knew much less and did not stand on the shoulders of giants.</p><p>Even in something like making a good living through mass media via presenting yourself as a celebrity there were equivalents then who are our equals now. Consider Mnesarete of Thespiai. Her name means “Remembrance of Excellence”. But she was called Phryne: toad. Why? Because&nbsp; people thought her skin color, yellow, was like that of a toad. That was thought very very attractive in the Athens of the -300s. Phryne was the favorite model for Aphrodite of the sculptors of her day. And I do not think she would have had anything to learn from Kim Kardashian about how to manage your celebrity. After all, 2000s years after her death people were still writing poems about and marveling at statues of her as Aphrodite.</p><p>The ancients were—at least those who were not protein-deprived <em>in utero</em> from malnutrition—our equals in intelligence, cultural sophistication, mechanical ingenuity,&nbsp; intellectual creativity, and, in short, in the ability to think and do.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Hellenistic-Era Technology: The Anti-Kythera Mechanism</h3><p>Let me pick one example of Greek accomplishment that is at least adjacent to the process of technological innovation and development that has driven our civilization to its high prosperity. Let me talk about the Anti-Kythera Mechanism.</p><p>Found in a shipwreck offshore of the southern tip of the Peloponnesian peninsula, the Anti-Kythera Mechanism was built between -150 and -70, probably by artisans and scientists on the island of Rhodes. As reconstructed, its outer shell was a 13” x 7” x 4“ wooden box Inside were gears—with the largest of them 5” in diameter. It looks as though there were 37 gear wheels in all.</p><p>It was a mechanical computer, a clock calendar, astronomical observation and modeling device. By turning a crank on the side, you turned the interlinked gears to make pointers on the outside of the box tell you the location of astronomical objects on any particular day. A user of the Anti-Kythera Mechanism could thus follow the movements of the Moon and the Sun through the zodiac. He—almost surely a “he”—could predict when it was likely that there might be eclipses. The box even modeled the irregular orbit of the Moon, for the Moon's orbit is not a circle but an ellipse, and so its velocity as it revolves around the earth is greater when the moon is near its perigee than when it is near its apogee. (That motion had been studied in the late -100s by the astronomer Hipparkhos of Rhodes; a natural speculation is that he may have been involved in the mechanism’s construction.) It includes, in concrete mechanical gear-driven form, the most advanced astronomy known to the Greeks.</p><p>The technological competence to make such a mechanism was lost. The astronomical knowledge was lost in the Latin Western Mediterranean, but preserved in the Greek Eastern Mediterranean and eagerly sought by the Muslim Middle-East, where the transfer of a copy of Claudius Ptolemy’s <em>Almagest</em> to Baghdad was demanded by the Kalifa Al-Ma’mun before he would sign a peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire. What they made was less complex, however: mechanisms of similar complexity would not be seen again until the mechanical astronomical clocks made in Western Europe more than a thousand years later, in the 1300s. Ancient civilization was capable of making devices of extraordinary complexity and precision.</p><p>When it was shipwrecked, the Anti-Kythera Mechanism was being carried from somewhere in the Aegean Sea region to somewhere in Italy. Was it booty that Roman commanders were carrying home after a successful conquest or raid? Was it commissioned by some wealthy Roman worthy to put on display in his house? Was it going to be an educational tool that a Greek philosopher or slave-tutor would use for demonstrations or lessons? We do not know.</p><p>Marcus Tullius Cicero wrote, in his <em>De Re Publica</em>, about the wonders of modern science and the ability to build… <em>spherai</em> is what he calls them. Which means “sphere”, as you'd expect it to do. But it clearly has a special technical meaning here: a model to show the movements of the stars and the planets, the Moon, the Sun. We don't know exactly what Cicero was talking about:</p><blockquote><p>C. Sulpicius Gallus… by chance in the house of [his one-time co-consul] M. Marcellus… [saw] a <em>sphere</em>… which the ancestor of M. Marcellus had taken from the conquered Syracusans… out of their wealthy and embellished city; the only thing he had possessed himself of among so great a spoil… which Arkhimedes also had made…. When Gallus began very scientifically to explain the nature of the mechanism; the Sicilian [Arkhimedes] appeared to me to possess more genius, than human nature would seem to be capable of…. The motions of the sun, moon, and those five stars which are called wandering…. Arkhimedes… had discovered a method of producing the unequal and various courses, with their dissimilar velocities…. The moon was made to succeed the sun by as many revolutions of the brass circle, as it actually took days to do in the heavens…</p></blockquote><p>Was this a similar mechanism? Probably.</p><p>We do know he ascribed the <em>spherai</em> to Archimedes. We do know that the Roman aristocrats who had these things were interested in collecting them as booty and bringing them back as wonders to display after successful wars—much more interested than in say, founding universities or endowing departments of astronomy and astronomical knowledge.</p><p>The only kingdom who seriously did do that was the Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt that established, maintained and supported the Library of Alexandria. The Roman emperors as they succeeded the Ptolemies continued the practice. But that was it.</p><p>Military research and development? Yes. Staff architects for the waterworks? Yes. More general natural philosophers? No. They accomplished they accomplished great things. They could have accomplished greater things. And yet they did not.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Prosperity &amp; Human Flourishing?</h3><p>We have seen how the coming of institutions that turned the Aegean Sea basin from an arena for the bloody struggles or piratical thugs into one in which humans could build a, well, civilization could boost population and population density in the Greek “Efflorescence”. We have gestured at how such an efflorescence could also boost the level of ideas each deployed in the Aegean Sea basin economy: ideas could be more easily and more completely transmitted with denser populations and more trade, and ideas that required a larger scale of production and hence a finer division of labor could be deployed and diffused much better in the much denser, much more trade intensive economy of the classical age. But the evidence suggests not just that the Greek efflorescence brought with it a higher population, but also much greater production per capita and per worker. How would that come about?</p><p>In the model of the Malthusian economy, the level of worker productivity and income per capita depends primarily on two factors: a society’s level of true subsistence-necessities consumption, and its taste for luxuries broadly defined. (It also depends positively on the rate of ideas growth and on the salience of ideas vs. resources in generating labor efficiency, and negatively on the sensitivity of population to prosperity, but those are quantitatively unimportant.) What can you say about those factors as the Greek Aegean Sea basin moved from its early iron dark age into its classical efflorescence?</p><p>Less random death from pirate raids, and the replacement of wars conducted by raids and&nbsp; looting that devastated noncombatant populations by a different kind of war, one in which hoplites in phalanxes confronted each other in large-scale pitched battles decided by the push of spear—these things would tend to lower true subsistence-necessities consumption, and so reduce visible indicia of prosperity, however good they may have been for non-combatant populations left alive, unenslaved, and unraped. Working on the other side, as a positive effect on equilibrium productivity levels (although a sharp negative on societal well-being), Classical Greek society appears to have been more hierarchical, and more patriarchal, which means the growth of female infanticide: bluntly, killing the babies of slaves, and killing non-slave babies when you already had too many girls in the household, or if the male babies looked sickly.</p><p>Then there is the taste for luxuries. A desire to live in cities? Check. An increasing degree of social hierarchy leading to a high-consumption leisured upper class? Check. Growing availability of luxuries to tempt the upper class into buying objects and experiences rather than maintaining hangers-on as muscle? Check. Trade and openness that allowed the middle class to spend on things other than those that enhanced Darwinian reproduction fitness as well? Check.</p><p>That's it seems entirely understandable that the Greek efflorescence saw increases in both population density and in at least average standards of material comfort and labor productivity.</p><p>Whether the Aegean sea basin in -350 was a better place for humans than the Aegean sea basin in -950 is a more difficult problem. I am not confident that I have an answer, or even a view.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Roman Empire</h3><p>Classical Greece was very impressive culturally. The civilization of Macedon that was its successor, that was the axis of the so-called Hellenistic Age in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East—with “Middle East” extending to the Punjab and to the shadows of the Tien Shan Mountains—was very impressive culturally and militarily: Alexander the Great conquered, and his successors, the so-called Diodakhi, continued to conquer. But it was not impressive politically: Alexander’s empire immediately fell apart at his death.</p><p>Republican and then Imperial Rome were impressive culturally, militarily, and politically. The Romans not only spread their culture, they conquered. They not only conquered, they turned the inhabitants of their empire into <em>Romans</em>. And it echoed down the millennium. The last man to claim to be Roman Emperor—“Cæsar of Rome”—the Ottoman-Dynasty ruler of Turkey and its empire, abdicated his throne only in 1922. The last man to claim to be Cæsar was King George VI of the United Kingdom, in his role as Kaiser-i-Hind, Emperor of India. He renounced that title only in 1947.</p><p>Before -340 Rome was nothing special. In -390 Rome had been sacked by the Senones band of Gauls. In the -340s it was one of the city-states of the Latin-speaking region that was the plain of Latium, duking it out with the others. It was the largest, but that just meant that the others were usually allied together as the Latin League to constrain and contain it. Sometimes—when there were external enemies in the forms of Gauls or Etruscans—they allied and fought together. Most of the time they fought against each other. City-state war and peace business as usual.</p><p>Before the coming of the Roman empire, in the Mediterranean basin and also in elsewhere, the rule was that you did not get huge, durable states and empires. The rule was that empires were based on one or two city-states, their ruling families, and the military power they could project—primarily by overawing their neighbors and getting their neighbors to join in their armies. If you were a city-state close by to Ashur or Nineveh, knuckling under to the Assyrians was a very good idea, until the Assyrians showed weakness. Therefore empires were not that large, and relatively evanescent. (This with the exception of ancient Egypt, where the country’s being just one long line of stuff along the Nile greatly limited opportunities to revolt and greatly aided the projection of power, as long as you could hold the Nile Delta against attackers from the north). And in Greece you did not get empires, save for the extremely short-lived Athenian and perhaps the earlier Minoan thalassocracies, until Alexander the Great. And his empire and those of his successors were evanescent as well.</p><p>Egypt aside, the only thing that came even moderately close to approaching the same league as the Roman Empire was the Haxamanishya (“Akhaimenid”) Persian Empire, which did stretch from the Aral Sea to the Nile Cataracts and from the Indus River to Thrace, but which lasted for only two centuries, not eight. How the Haxamanishya Dynasty and the Persian aristocracy managed to do it is not clear to me. My guess is that it was because they came from the horse-pastures of Iran and were near to the heavily populated well-irrigated agricultural districts of Mesopotamia. The horse pastures meant that you had warrior-aristocrats and their followers who were trained to ride horses nearly from birth—and to shoot arrows from them. The maxim was that a Persian aristocratic male was taught three and only three things: to ride horses, to shoot arrows and to always tell the truth. And if you ride horses and shoot arrows nearly from birth, you get very good at doing so.</p><p>The immediate conquest of Mesopotamia gave this Haxamanishya Persian Empire tax revenue and resources to support an empire. The horse-pastures gave them an extraordinarily deadly military strike force: one that could move faster than their potential adversaries, kill anything they could come within arrow -each of, and evade anything that might have a momentary battlefield advantage. So you spread out until you reach the jungles of India where the arrows can’t fly long distances, the deserts where the horses cannot find fodder, or the excessively rough country of Greece and inner Anatolia. And previously unseen rapid communications hold the thing together. But they do so for only two centuries.</p><p>The Persian Empire is then conquered by Alexander the Great. But his potential successors could not hold it together.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Sources of Roman Imperial Scope:</h3><p>The rise of Rome from just another Greek-culture periphery city-state and associated tribal grouping to Eurasia-straddling empire was due to four major factors:</p><ul><li><p><strong>militarism</strong> on the part of élites who needed victories in war to attain office and hence rise in status,</p></li><li><p>an unparalleled ability to <strong>mobilize</strong> the non-élite citizens for war,</p></li><li><p>sufficient sharing of the benefits of conquest—in plunder, slaves, and land—to generate a popular <strong>mandate</strong> to continue the policy of conquest, and then</p></li><li><p><strong>mass</strong> via the incorporation of the conquered of two generations ago into this generation’s Romans, and thus beneficiaries of conquest, to give Rome vastly greater strength than any other Mediterranean-are polity.</p></li></ul><p>These four all generated <strong>mammoth</strong> military, and then political and economic, expansions of the territory ruled by Rome after about the year -340.</p><p>The Romans rule the Mediterranean basin starting around -180 for 800 years. And the Romans do what no earlier empire had managed to do: <em>they change the language</em> of the people they rule. By the end of the Roman Empire, the west of it speaks Latin, and the east of it speaks Greek. The civilization and culture has been imposed on the peoples of the empire in a way not previously seen. Now there were equals of the Roman Empire in the Agrarian Age—the Han (although they only lasted for 400 years), and the Islamic Kalifate. But there was nothing larger and more durable.</p><p>The natural questions are: How did they do it? And what did doing it mean for the people of the empire?</p><p>It took a while. Go back to -500, the time of the first treaty between Rome and Carthage, Rome marked out Latium as its sphere of influence but not control—a Monroe Doctrine, of sorts. The 400s seem to have seen a five-sided conflict over the plains of Latium between Etrusci to the northwest Aequi to the northeast, Volsci to the southwest, Latins (usually allied with Romans according to the terms of the Foedus Cassianum of 493 BC in the middle), and Romans. The Gauls appeared at the end of the century: they sacked Rome in 390, and threatened it again in 360.</p><p>By 350 BC the Etrusci, Aequi, and Vosci were no longer an existential security threat. Rome had conquered and annexed the southernmost Etruscan city of Veii in 396; it had annexed Antium, the principal town of the Volsci, in 377; and the Aequi disappear from the sources between 388 and 304.</p><p>Nevertheless, as of 350 BC, the second treaty with the Carthaginians indicates that Rome was still marking Latium as its sphere of influence, but nothing beyond, and Rome was not claiming control of Latium—only a sphere of influence, with a requirement that Carthage hand over any Latium town it had conquered and sacked. But it was still priority, and not paramountcy, in Latium as of 350 BC, and no claims of any sphere of influence beyond.</p><p>Then in a short three-year war, Rome fought, defeated, and conquered its allies in the Latin League. And its policy of “incorporation” began.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Incorporation</h3><p>I stress incorporation. There was no way you could become a Persian aristocrat—you were a conquered servant, or slave. There was no way you could become an Assyrian. There was no way you could become an Athenian, or a Spartan: you had to be born one. But you could become a Roman.</p><p>Go back to -340. Rome has finally won what it wants to be its final, decisive victory over the Latin League, and the other citizens of Latium. And so it decides to change the game of city-state politics. It takes Romans, and plants them in the territories of the other city-states, as colonies. And the colonists remain Romans. It takes some of the other city-states, and makes them Romans—all of the Latin League save Tibur and Praeneste, which were retained as Latin allies bound by bilateral treaties, gained the status <em>civitas sine suffragio</em>, citizenship without the vote in Roman popular assemblies. And still others conquered cities become allies, bound to Rome by bilateral treaties, obligated to assist Rome in war and privileged to share in the plunder. If the conquest and annexation of Veii early in the -300s had doubled the Roman population base, the transformation of Latins into Romans more than doubled it yet again.</p><p>The polity remains “Rome”, and decisions are made in the city. But the number of people who regard themselves as Romans (and their allies) who can be mobilized for war now encompass everyone living in the plain of Latium.</p><p><strong>Militarism</strong>: members of the élite competing for authority and status know that they have to have been a successful generals for the people of Rome to vote to elect them to an office. And, in Rome, being elected a magistrate is the point of the game. Alongside militarism comes <strong>mobilization</strong>: getting everyone to show up for battle, with cheaper weapons and with state support for the army, rather than having the army limited to those who could afford to and then be bothered to spend the money buying the weapons needed to stand in the battle lines. And Roman citizens were eager to be mobilized, gave a <strong>mandate</strong> to the élite for conquest. Why? Because the Roman Republic also created institutions that shared the benefits of conquest widely. Members of a successful army would get plunder, and could, if they wished, get new large farms for themselves carved out of the territory of the Etruscans or the Campanians or the Samnites or whoever was the enemy-of-the-year. And the <strong>mass</strong> of Romans grew. You might be a conquered slave. But your grandson would have been freed, become a client of the family of their ex-master, and been Roman citizens. Their grandson might be a centurion, and his son might become a senator. And his grandson might become an emperor.</p><p>Looking at the emperors of Rome, the first two dynasties—the first of&nbsp; Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero (-27 to 68); and then the second of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian (69 to 96)—were all Roman aristocrats. The first emperor of the next dynasty (96 to 192), Nerva, is a Roman aristocrat too. Nerva, however, finds himself in political trouble: his predecessor Domitian had been assassinated, after all. So what does Nerva do? He goes down from his palace on the Palatine Hill—the word “palace” <em>is</em> a shortened version of the hill’s name—to the Roman Forum in the valley below, walks up to the speaker’s podium on the slope of the neighboring Capitoline Hill, and cries out: “May good fortune favor the Roman people and the Senate and myself! I hereby adopt as my son Marcus Ulpius Traianus!”</p><p>Trajan was a Spaniard. Trajan was commander of the largest army in the Roman Empire—the army of Upper Germany. Trajan was the most respected general and administrator. By adopting him as his son and heir, Nerva had just given Trajan the religious duty to avenge anything bad that might happen to Nerva. He had named as his successor to the Emperorship a man who controlled the force to make it stick. Later, as Trajan aged, he adopted his similarly Spanish younger cousin Hadrian as his successor. And the founder of the subsequent, fourth dynasty (193 to 235) of Roman emperors was a Libyan: Septimius Severus.</p><p>You could join the Romans, and become Roman yourself. That, plus its other institutions, was what gave Rome extraordinary geographic reach and extraordinary temporal duration.&nbsp; What were those other institutions?</p><p>Well, it's a republic. So you have magistrates, who are in the business of being famous of becoming famous by successful conquest, but then who have to give place to others. So the idea that holding on to the position, you have, um, is always less than we need to find someone else to conquer so we can make our reputation.</p><p>You have a constitution that provides for extraordinary amounts of political negotiation, at the things that preserve the mandate, which allows for the mobilization of the city behind militarist expansion, also enabled by the mass incorporation of Concord communities.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Flexibility</h3><p>You have an incredible willingness to be flexible with your institutions and your technologies that we need a road from Rome to Capua so we can get legions there quickly if the Samnites attack. Our cities need a better water supply, so we will build aqueducts like no one's ever seen.</p><p>Then, all of a sudden we're facing not the Latins, but instead the Greeks, who all fight with spears and are close together like a hedgehog. A Greek phalanx properly trained and holding together can destroy any looser array. So we going to learn to fight with spears in the phalanx. But we're also going to keep our light-armed troops for when we hit for the Etruscans, or the Samnites. The Samnites have superior ways of organizing the troops to fight in hills, we're going to adopt their system as well. We need to have long term service soldiers, because campaigns now last longer than just one summer, because we now have an empire. Well, we're going to turn our army professional. And then we need the imperial legions, in which we turn the army into professionals.</p><p>As of the year 150 the workings of the factors captured in this model certainly led to a very impressive “efflorescence” throughout the territory of the Pax Romana, of the peace of the Roman Empire. The empire and its culture had an enormous taste for “luxuries”—including middle-class conveniences, the presence of a leisured upper class, and a taste for urban life, all with effects on human flourishing both positive and negative, depending on where you happen to be in the empire’s strongly hierarchical social pyramid, and on what you take the appropriate scale of values to be. The boost of this factor to the Roman economy’s average productivity were partially, but only very partially offset, by the fact that the risks of violent death within the bounds of the Pax Romana were relatively low, as long as you were not one of the slaves confined to the mines or to the worst of the plantations, and hence that the required level of necessities consumption was low because even the malnourished had a higher chance of being able to live their lives and reproduce.</p><p>On the side of population density, of people per unit of resources, a higher taste for “luxuries” reduces population density. The resources to make those luxuries are not used to support making people stronger and healthier and more likely to survive and reproduce. But that factor is overwhelmed by how the Pax Romana allows people to build: to invest in infrastructure, in tools, in land improvements, in sophisticated enterprises, all of which greatly raise the support given to human labor by non-human tools as the capital-intensity of the economy receives a great boost. Plus a dense civilization will be likely to push its level of ideas H deployed and diffused throughout the economy to whatever the then-current state of human knowledge was. A thin population in a time in which long-distance trade is difficult and costly requires that people be jacks—(and jills)-of-all-trades rather than masters of one. And useful ideas that have been discovered and developed have a very hard time being deployed and diffused.</p><p>Roman dominance lasts for 800 years in the Mediterranean basin, right from -150 on up to 650 or so. And even after 650 the Roman Empire hangs on in Turkey and the Balkans for an additional five centuries. In 1204, the Late-Roman Byzantine Empire is conquered by treachery from by Western European crusaders who are supposed to come help them fight the Muslims and instead betray them. The Byzantines recover their empire 50 years later, but it's never the same.</p><p>Yet there is a guy calling himself Roman Emperor in 1453 in the city of Constantinople when Mehmet II Osmanli conquers it for the Ottoman Empire—and the Ottoman Sultan then takes on the title of Roman Emperor himself.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The High Empire</h3><p>Note the while the economic state of the Roman Empire was exceptional for Agrarian-Age history, it was not isolated. Moving northeast from the Roman Empire you come to barbarian kingdoms on its borders which are furiously learning from Rome in developing civilizational complexity, royal authority, more sophisticated divisions of labor, and better equipped and disciplined military castes. Moving east from the Roman Empire you come to the Parthian Empire, successor in the traditions of the ancient Near East of Mesopotamia and the Iranian Plateau, itself a high civilization that would have received much more attention from historians had it not existed in the shade of the Roman Empire. Moving northeast we come to the caravan-route civilizations of the Silk Road in Central Asia. Moving east from Parthia we come to the Kushans and the Śātavāhanas in the subcontinent of India. And on the far side of the Himalayas the Han Dynasty (-202 to 220) had unified the Chinese-speaking culture area in a single state from Vietnam to Korea, and has reached out to establish its suzerainty over the Protectorate of the Western Regions beyond Yumen Pass in the Tarim Basin, with the Protector holding court at the garrison of Wulei.</p><p>The peoples of the empire understood that they were living in a remarkable time—that the Roman Empire at its height was something that had not been seen before. I already noted the professional thought leader of the day Ælius Aristides, and the oration he gave in front of the Emperor Antoninus Pius, in which he claimed that “all meet here [in the city of Rome]… all the arts and crafts that are or ever have been, all the things that are engendered or or grow from the earth…” Thus: “it is not easy to which is greater, the superiority of this city in respect to the cities that now are, or the superiority of this city respect to the empires that ever were…”</p><p>Antoninus Pius was the fourth of the Five Good Emperors of the six-emperor Antonine Dynasty: Roman aristocrat senator Nerva, his adopted son Trajan, Trajan’s adopted son (who was his younger cousin) Hadrian, Hadrian’s adopted son (who had married Hadrian’s niece) Antoninus Pius, Antoninus Pius’s adopted son (who was Hadrian’s great-nephew) Marcus Aurelius, but then Marcus Aurelius had a son who survived, Commodus, who inherited the throne, and is played by Joaquin Phoenix in the highly potboiler-ish movie <em>Gladiator</em>. And it is conventional to take the reign of Commodus as the time when it all came crashing down.</p><p>But that is not correct.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Decline (but Fall Takes a Very Long Time Indeed)</h3><p>In the middle of the -150 to 650 story of Roman Mediterranean dominance is this rather awkward political transition from Republic to Empire from -50 to -20. But the end of the Roman Republic in the -50s is not the decline of Rome. The civilizational rise continues for another two centuries, until the Antonine Plague arrives in 165 during the reign of Commodus’s father, Marcus Aurelius.</p><p>Historians of previous centuries saw nothing wrong with attributing the collapses of civilizations and the dark ages that followed to the coming and rule of a bad king. And they showed no hesitation in judging the worth of monarchs. We step back and, looking at the first three dynasties of Roman emperors, cannot help but notice that when we rank emperors by their goodness as recorded by our historical sources, we get roughly this list:</p><p>Augustus, <br>Trajan, <br>Marcus Aurelius, <br>Hadrian, <br>Vespasian, <br>Titus, <br>Antoninus Pius, <br>Nerva, <br>Tiberius, <br>Claudius, <br>Domitian, <br>Commodus, <br>Caligula, <br>Nero.</p><p>Who comes at the end of this list? The four emperors, starting with Domitian, who were assassinated—and whose successors desperately wanted to blacken their memory in order to justify the assassination or their benefiting from it. Why does Claudius come at the end of the list of emperors who died in their beds? Because his adopted son Nero killed his co-emperor, Claudius’s biological son Britannicus, and so wanted Claudius portrayed not as an evil tyrant but as an incompetent fool whose biological family was unworthy of rule. Similarly, Caligula wanted to mark that he was making a clean break from Tiberius.</p><p>The other emperors who come earlier in the list? All followed by their designated successors, who wanted to use the weight of history to reinforce their rule.</p><p>What are the chances that the worst emperors were just those four where the assassins succeeded—because there are always people whom the emperor has injured, who are potential assassins?</p><p>Food for thought.</p><p>We—especially Willem Jongman—trace the decline and fall of the Roman Empire to the consequences of the three great plagues that hit the Roman Empire after the year 165: the Antonine Plague of 165-180, the Plague of St. Cyprian of 249-262, and the Plague of Justinian of 541-549. Each of them took down about a quarter of the population of the Roman Empire.</p><p>What happens when an élite control a society, but all of a sudden—because of a sharp population decline—the amount of potential surplus the élite can extract from the population drops, and the stakes involved in controlling and extracting surplus from any individual worker rise because individual workers are scarcer and more valuable? In Britain after the Black Death of 1346-8, the élite tied to tighten the screws: impose price and wage controls to keep workers from utilizing their bargaining power, reinforcing restrictions on mobility, and hoping to increase the amount extracted from each peasant and craftsman in order to keep their revenues up in spite of the reduced population. It did not work: the institutions the Norman and then Plantagenet kings had put in place to maximize their power against the barons eliminated the medium-scale territorial lordships that would have been needed to make a fugitive peasant-return policy work. In Eastern Europe after 1346-8 as well, serfdom died away, as lords desperate for people to work the land offered attractive terms to in-migrants. Two-hundred years later in Eastern Europe, however, there was another upward leap in the value of peasant work, as the Vistula watershed and places further east became suppliers of grain to rapidly growing Western Europe and to the growing Volga watershed power of Muscovy. And that time the ruling élite enforced serfdom, and made it stick.</p><p>The debates over why it went one way some of the time and the other way the rest of the time are interminable, and inconclusive. I would claim that we really do not know. My view is that it mostly depends mostly on whether the élite is able to organize itself, or is split and so incapable of successful collective action. And it depends somewhat on statesmanship—are there powerful people who have the long-term health and prosperity of the polity in their minds, rather than just their personal or family advantage?</p><p>The Antonine Plague of 165-180 was followed by a clamping-down on opportunity and mobility, and a tightening of the exploitative screws. Instead of Roman citizens being a substantial (and growing) class with legal due process rights and access to grain and land, a new set of distinctions begin to emerge: the distinctions between the between <em>honestiores</em> of high status and <em>humiliores</em> of low status and with next to no due-process or substantive rights began to emerge. As early as 200, formerly free farmers were attaching themselves to local landlords—and not in a normal-for-Rome client-patron relationship, but in one of serflike subservience, trading resources for protection against roving bandits and also against the state’s tax-collecting functionaries. Emperors found themselves able to do less, as the smaller population had to support the same administrative, upper class, and military infrastructure.</p><p>There is a shift toward military power as a decisive factor within the empire. “Be in harmony with each other, enrich the soldiers, scorn everybody else” was what Emperor Septimius Severus (145 - 211, Emperor from 193) told his sons Caracalla and Geta on his deathbed. And there seems to be increased chaos in high politics, as shown in the relative reign lengths of the Antonine and Severan dynasties—they get a lot shorter in the Severans, and there is one successful non-family usurper in the middle, Macrinus:</p><blockquote><p>Nerva 96-98 “Antonine”<br>Trajan 98-117<br>Hadrian 117-138<br>Antoninus Pius 138-161<br>Marcus Aurelius 161-180<br>Commodus 180-192<br>Pertinax 193<br>Didius Julianus 193<br>Septimus Severus 193-211 “Severan”<br>Caracalla 211-217<br>Macrinus 217-218 (usurper)<br>Elegabalus 218-222<br>Severus Alexander 222-235</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc6a0c12-4c87-4b26-966b-d3009545ec82_1586x1230.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc6a0c12-4c87-4b26-966b-d3009545ec82_1586x1230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc6a0c12-4c87-4b26-966b-d3009545ec82_1586x1230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc6a0c12-4c87-4b26-966b-d3009545ec82_1586x1230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc6a0c12-4c87-4b26-966b-d3009545ec82_1586x1230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cc6a0c12-4c87-4b26-966b-d3009545ec82_1586x1230.png" width="1456" height="1129" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cc6a0c12-4c87-4b26-966b-d3009545ec82_1586x1230.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1129,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:172334,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc6a0c12-4c87-4b26-966b-d3009545ec82_1586x1230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc6a0c12-4c87-4b26-966b-d3009545ec82_1586x1230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc6a0c12-4c87-4b26-966b-d3009545ec82_1586x1230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc6a0c12-4c87-4b26-966b-d3009545ec82_1586x1230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div></blockquote><p>Septimius Severus died in February 211. By December, Caracalla and the Prætorians had murdered Caracalla’s brother Geta to clear the field. Caracalla reigned until 217, when he was assassinated by a disgruntled soldier. An attempt by non-senatorial-class Prætorian Prefect Macrinus to seize the throne was defeated by Caracalla’s aunt Julia Mæsa, who installed her grandson Elagabalus and then, as a within-family fight turned deadly, her other grandson Severus Alexander. Severus Alexander ruled until 235, when he was assassinated by mutinous soldiers of the Legion XXI Primigenia in Mainz.</p><p>So what happened to produce the collapse of law and order, and the destruction of the social mechanisms of hierarchy and control that enabled a great taste for and that fueled a strong desire for luxuries, and indeed for comforts as well? “Comforts” here means something as simple as a legionary being able to have a well-made bowl from Italy, even if he were stationed at Hadrian's Wall on the southern border of Scotland.</p><p>How does the late Roman Empire differ from the Roman Empire in days of expansion? Well, <strong>militarism</strong> is different, for one thing. In striking contrast to earlier days, a successful general, a competent general, is a threat to the Emperor: not to be encouraged. <strong>Mobilization</strong>—in order to extract more resources from a smaller population, the people must be disarmed rather than mobilized. <strong>Distribution</strong>—the smaller pool of benefits because the plague has reduced the population needs to be hoarded for those with connections not shared. <strong>Incorporation</strong>—well, you can no longer join the Roman upper class, but you can decide to join the barbarians to join the Goths.</p><p>Perhaps a major institutional error was committed by Septimius Severus. He enforced a separation between the rich senatorial class and those given command of legions. His idea was the only somebody who had both loyal legions and a large social-bureaucratic network within Rome could be a credible rebel and threat to him and his dynasty. Hence, a senator in command of an army. Arrange things so that one group of people, the senators, were wealthy and had the network of social and bureaucratic connections in Rome; and another, separate group had command of legions and armies and hence the opportunity to gain the loyalty of legions, and he and his dynasty would be safe.</p><p>That turned out not to be true. As Tacitus had written about the year of the four emperors following the death of Nero, it was then that the secret of the empire got out: legions, not the senate, made the emperor. But a frontier army-made emperor would then lack the bureaucratic and social connections in Rome to stabilize his rule. This meant not only that the emperors would be weak, but also that all of the other commanders of the other frontier armies would note how weak the emperor was, and think that they should make a play for the throne as well—if only because the emperor would know that he was weak, and that the other generals were thinking, and perhaps decide that he should strike first to deprive them of their commands and their lives.</p><p>After the murder of Severus Alexander (and his mother!) in a military mutiny, things get rougher—internal coups, and for the first time in more than 200 years Roman armies lose some important battles. Things come close to falling apart in the middle of the 200s. We can see this in the length of the reigns of the emperors after Severus Alexander and before Diocletian:</p><blockquote><p>Severus Alexander 222-235<br>Maximinius Thrax 235-238<br>Gordian I 238<br>Gordian II 238<br>Pupienus 238<br>Balbinus 238<br>Gordian III 238-244<br>Philip the Arab 244-249<br>Philip the Younger 247-249<br>Decius 249-251<br>Herennius Etruscus 251<br>Trebonius Gallus 251-253<br>Hostillian 251<br>Voluianus 251-253<br>Aemilianus 253<br>Silbannacus 253<br>Valerian 253-260<br>Galienus 253-268<br>Claudius Gothicus 268-270<br>Quintillus 270<br>Aurelian 270-275<br>Tacitus 275-276<br>Florianus 276<br>Probus 276-282<br>Carus 282-283<br>Carinus 283-285<br>Diocletian 284-305</p></blockquote><p>The 50 years from the death of Severus Alexander to 284 then saw 27 different emperors, at least as many other rebellious claimants, more-than-annual civil wars, the temporary split of the empire into three, ruled from Cologne in Germany, Rome, and Palmyra in Syria. The 249-262 Plague of St. Cyprian killed off perhaps a third of the population again. A new Persian Empire, the Sassanians, had destroyed a Roman army at Mesene in 231 even before the end of the Severan dynasty. The Persians went on to destroy another army and kill Emperor Goridan at Misiche in 244. Later the Persians won more battles at Barbalissos and Edessa, conquered the province of Armenia, and sacked Antioch, third largest city in the empire. The barbarian Heruli sacked Athens. The Goths sacked Ephesus. The Goths defeated Roman armies at Beroea and Abritus and forced the abandonment of the province of Dacia—Roumania—before rampaging through Thrace, sacking the great city of Philippopolis, founded by the father of Alexander the Great, and reportedly killing 100,000 Roman citizens before taking an equal number back across the Danube as slaves. The Roman-settled triangle in Germany between the Rhine and the Danube Rivers was abandoned to the Alemanni in 260, and the Alemanni then raided France and Italy. The Iuthungi defeated the Emperor Aurelian at Placentia before recovering the situation with victories at Fano and Pavia. The Franks broke through the Rhine defense line, and the Saxons started raiding the shore of the English Channel.</p><p>It was not so much that the barbarians were strong—although the barbarians along the Rhine and Danube lines had learned from what was now three centuries of contact with the Roman Empire. More important, perhaps, the forests of Germany had been substantially cut down and turned into fields in the three centuries since Julius Caesar’s raids across the Rhine and what had followed had led the Romans to conclude that the Germans were too fierce to conquer given the very limited plunder on offer. Carthage, or even Macedon, had been in their day much more formidable foes. It was that the Roman Empire of the mid 200s, supporting a parasitic élite on top of a plague-decimated population, and riven by annual civil wars over who should be emperor, no longer had the institutions mobilize resources on the scale that the Roman republic had been able to for centuries earlier when it had had less than a seventh of the population of the empire.</p><p>Septimius Severus and company did what they could—the army up from 300,000 to 500,000, and so forth. Perhaps the miracle was that the crisis was delayed until the mid-200s. But come it did.</p><p>We economists tend to look suspiciously about arguments that a key decision by a powerful man on the spot could have durably changed the course of history. This prejudice of ours has to be wrong sometimes. Certainly Augustus and, after 284, Domitian mattered, and mattered a lot. Certainly emperors in the mid-200s who had all of social, bureaucratic, and military power would have done better then the 28 poor slobs each of whom had only one sort of power. But we economists tend to be attracted, instead, to the hypothesis that it was the shift of the Roman élite. They had regarded their lessers as potential partner in conquest, exploitation, rule, and economic growth, and hence to be given opportunity. But after the population decline of the Antonine Plague and then the further decline of the Plague of St. Cyprian, viewing their lessers not as partners in the empire but as subjects to be dominated and exploited was much more the attitude.</p><p>Underneath the political recovery, it appears that the economy was falling apart. Perhaps the ultimate lesson is that, when a resource base declines, an upper class finds it next to impossible to scale itself back and live within its means. Shrinking the degree of luxury, the scale of your dependents and subordinates, and the size of your forces—that requires depriving of resources and hence making mortal enemies of those who have been your immediate allies and supporters. It is much easier and much more attractive to simply tighten the screws on those whom you are exploiting. And as you tighten those screws, you remove their incentives and ability to be productive and to grow the economy. This strategy may stabilize the situation in your day. But your successors will then find that you have eaten a good deal of their seed corn, and that they face and even sharper dilemma with even fewer options.</p><p>But stability, relative stability, was reattained—a poorer, more unequal, more bureaucratic, but still massive empire in a pattern set by Diocletian—at the end of the 200s. It is not until the 400s that independent barbarian kings begin grabbing pieces of what had been the empire for themselves.</p><p>Diocletian replaced the <em>Principate</em> established by Augustus with the <em>Dominate</em>. In the <em>Principate</em>, the Emperor had theoretically been merely the First among the senators, with his formal powers (i) the possession of the Tribune’s veto over government actions, (ii) personal ownership of Egypt, (iii) governor (through his deputies) of all of the border provinces with legionary garrisons, and (iv) control over the Prætorian Guard in Rome. In the Dominate, the emperor was addressed as <em>dominus et deus</em>: master and god. Under the Dominate, the frontiers were stabilized, again—Roumania and the Rhine-Danube triangle in Germany excepted. The population recovered. And a new, semi-stable dynasty, that of Constantine, reigned from 306 to 363, and held things together.</p><p>But starting in the 400s that independent barbarian kings begin grabbing pieces of what had been the empire for themselves.</p><div><hr></div><h3>“Developmental” &amp; “Extractive” Institutions</h3><p>What did this transformation from developmental to extractive institutions mean, concretely?</p><p>We have lots of documents from Egypt. In one, Anoup is writing to his landlord Flavius Apion. He’s not writing as a tenant farmer who has made a win-win bargain with Flavius Apion to rent some of his land so he can grow crops. He's writing as all-but-a-slave. He is writing as a dependent and subservient person, under the thumb of his landlord, who exercises total social control over the neighborhood, backed up by bullyboys he has hired away from the legions.</p><p>The Emperor Justinian in Constantinople very much does not like this. He wants the soldiers on the frontiers fighting potential enemies who threatened the security of the Roman Empire. He writes to his Praetorian Prefect, concerning the army, and asks the Praetorian Prefect to make the landlords stop hiring soldiers away to serve as bully boys to beat up peasants who don't pay enough rent on time.</p><p>But who is this Praetorian Prefect? Yes, it is the same Flavius Apion who is terrorizing Anoup. And Flavius Apion is also the largest employer of legionaries-as-bully boys in all of Egypt.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Dark Age Begins</h3><p>And in the long run, to maintain the loyalty of this last group, you have to settle your barbarian warriors inside of the Roman Empire, and give them a role dominating the productive peasantry. That then eliminates the tax base that funds the Roman bureaucracy, the Roman army, and the cities. And so Alaric and Stilicho are still primarily Roman generals with barbarian allies. But then Alaric switches, and sacks Rome. And their successors three generations down are primarily barbarian kings, ruling pieces of what had been the empire. And they rule through an nascent noble class made up of those of their barbarian warriors who have been most richly rewarded, plus whatever surviving Roman aristocrats&nbsp; managed to move out of the cities on time, and turn their families’ social and bureaucratic power into regional territorial power, as those who had been rent- and tax-paying peasants on their estates who paid them money become serfs and thanes on their territorial lordships who owe them loyalty and service. The medieval feudal system was on its way.</p><p>By the early 400s, as the game of Roman high politics was played in the western empire at least, success required having (a) the approval and the blessing of somebody at least calling themself “emperor”, (b) control of a Roman army and of the flow of taxes to support it and reward your allies, but also (c) access to an outside group of warriors of high moral, who did regard themselves not as slaves or servants of a master but of the valued companions and comrades of a leader. Ideological legitimation, military professionalism, taxed resources, and a force with what later thinkers, notably Ibn Khaldun, would call <em>assibayah</em>.</p><p>Sometimes barbarians take over an empire without a great effect on the overall level of prosperity of civilization. In Mesopotamia Seleukids replace the Haxamanishya, and then Parthians replace Seleukids, and then Sassanians replace Parthians, Umayyads replace Sassanians, Abbasids replace Umayyads, and Turks and Kurds replace Abbasids—and Mesopotamian civilization goes on. The biggest changes are cultural, and the movement of the capital from Babylon to Seleukia to Ctesiphon to Baghdad.</p><p>The collapse of the Roman Empire in the west was very different. The imperial peace and the legal order broke down. As a result, there was an enormous increase in hierarchy at the lower levels of society. People ceased to be free subjects (even if they were not Roman citizens), because to be free was to leave oneself vulnerable to the roving barbarians, who might will kill you, and would certainly steal your stuff. Better to be a serf, or perhaps even a slave. The collapse of the Roman Empire in the West saw a collapse in investment, in urbanization, in the taste for and indeed the ability to produce luxuries. Perhaps the peasants were better off—probably they were better fed if only because population density was so low because risks of violent death were higher. But probably not a good thing for society as a whole, and certainly not a good thing for the freedom of the lower class.</p><p><strong>O</strong>ver the centuries the volume of commerce, the sophistication of the division of labor, the size of cities, and security against roving bandits and barbarian war bands collapses. It takes centuries. But it collapses. The Wikipedia entry on the barbarian Lombard kings of Italy around 600 is worth reading:</p><blockquote><p>In 572… King Alboin was assassinated… by his wife Rosamund and her lover, the noble Helmichis…. They were forced to flee…. The thirty-five dukes assembled in Pavia to hail king Cleph…. He, too, fell victim to regicide in 574…. For a decade dukes ruled as absolute monarchs in their duchies…. In 584 the dukes agreed to crown King Cleph’s son, Autari…. He assumed, like the Ostrogoth Kings, the title of <em>Flavio</em>, with which he intended to proclaim himself also protector of all Romans in Lombard territory….

We see the virtual disappearance of trade over links of more than 200 miles. We see the disappearance of large scale production and distribution of things that were comfortable for workers and even for peasants to have. We see the complete collapse of any form of public works. We see only as much law and order as the feudal web network can provide.</p><p>The least false way to summarize all of this—the least false grand narrative, but it is still false, for all grand narratives cannot be but false given that the world is a complicated and confusing place—is to say that the population shocks of the plagues transform the institutions of the Roman Empire from being at least somewhat "developmental” and positive-sum to being overwhelmingly "extractive" and negative-sum. Was I not surprising that they were unable to maintain the pace of investment that had created the capital intensity and the resources to fuel economic efflorescence? That with the collapse of the investment and infrastructure that supported the resource base, that took down the sociological framework and social structures that supported the taste for luxuries that had stabilized Roman civilization at a relatively high level of output per capita and labor productivity?</p><p>Historian Edward Gibbon thus saw it as a morality play, the triumph of barbarism and religion—and the coming to power of emperors neither as far-sighted nor as well-intentioned in viewing their office as a public trust as those of the Antonine Dynasty. Bad emperor selected by a flawed constitution, barbarians themselves being pushed westward by the eruption of the Huns out of Central Asia into Europe who had learned much from the Romans, plus the rise of a Christianity that focused elite attention on figuring out how to store up treasure in heaven for the future rather than an how to act and sacrifice to maintain the empire and its civilization now. Yes, barbarians. Yes, religious change of focus from acting to preserve the state to looking toward a future life. Yes, emperors who make bad decisions. Certainly those did not help. But we economists are allergic to morality plays as history.</p><p>We tend, right now, to focus on the effects of the three great plagues that hit the Roman Empire, the Antonine Plague around 170 (of Smallpox?), the Plague of St. Cyprian around 250 (Eblola?). And, last, the plague of Justinian (probably the Bubonic Plague in the five hundreds. These plagues were the first empire-and-beyond plagues, were paradoxically made possible by, in fact, the scope and peace of the Roman Empire—that trade and transport were now sufficiently thick and intense that a plague could spread over the entire empire, rather than be confined to a province. What happened to the Roman Empire when the population all of a sudden dropped by a third in a generation? Well, the demands of the empire for revenue and of the upper class for rents and other resources remain the same, even though there are 1/3 fewer peasants to provide them. And still starting around 170. And again, around 250. And again, around 525.</p><p>The élites ratchet up the degree of exploitation. They focus less on sharing the benefits of prosperity and on infrastructure that will enable more prosperity and commerce, and more on figuring out how to extract a larger share of production from the great producer. Instead of everyone being a citizen. Now, there are high status and low status, people instead of having the freedom as a Roman citizen to move what you where you want, and do what you want. All of a sudden, even though you were not a slave, the empire forbade you to leave your particular land.</p><p>By the late six-hundreds the Roman Empire in the West was gone. And the Roman Empire in the east was tottering. They were medieval societies with unfree peasants largely bound to the land. And in the east, they were about to face the eruption of Islam out of the Arabian Desert.</p><p>Thus I tend to agree with Jongman that it was the shock of the plagues, followed by the particular form that the reaction took—that the elites were strong enough that their clamping-down control over the <em>humiliores</em> was effective, and then there were just not the resources available to maintain the empire at scale given how hobbled it was by the necessity of maintaining the flow of wealth to the now excessively large upper class. Still, Septimius Severus worked miracles: kept the situation from collapsing for a generation and a half before 235. And then the Domitian worked miracles, and re-stabilized the situation after 285. But after that the Dominate was surviving on borrowed time.</p><p>Do note that the Dark Age was partial. The Roman Empire in the west fell. The Roman Empire in the east—Greece, Bulgaria, and Anatolia—survived with ups and downs as a high civilization and a going concern until after 1200. And the Roman provinces of Syria, Palestina, Roman Arabia, Egypt, Libya, Africa, Mauritania, and the Hispanias became part of the Islamic civilization of the early Medieval period, also not a place and time usually thought of as a Dark Age</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Inequality and Exploitation</h3><p>Would it have been better to have been a working-class Briton around 1800 or a gatherer-hunter before -8000? Probably a gatherer-hunter.</p><p>On the one hand, if you are a gatherer-hunter you are buff! But there is lots of within-humanity violence: you run a substantial risk of being stabbed to death and having to watch your babies' brains bashed out against rocks. On the other hand, if you are an agriculturalist, you, have a chance of a long slow death from starvation and malnutrition. You are stunted, weak, with very bad teeth, and probably stupid from protein deprivation in utero. I don't think we really know what typical agrarian age diets did to brain function. We do know that they, that agrarian age mother's found themselves significantly compromised health-wise as the infant to be leeches calcium out of the mother's bones and teeth to build itself.</p><p>There is little to choose with respect to life expectancy. Infant mortality appears to be the same.</p><p>Oh: and gatherer-hunters face interesting lives in which they constantly solve environmental and social puzzles, sort of<em> a la </em>a slow-motion version of Super Mario. By contrast, the agrarian age sees you doing the same damn thing day after day after day. Plus the Agrarian Age brings patriarchy, and much more wealth and status inequality. This is so unless you are lucky enough to be one of the lords and masters. But if you are not, you run the risk that the lords and masters will find a way to torment you impressively to reinforce the principle that people should pay their rent and their taxes on time and in full. This is almost surely a big negative sum in the Agrarian Age: There are always many more to be dominated than there are to feel good about themselves because they dominate.</p><p>In this Agrarian-Age, from the discovery of agriculture on up to and beyond 1500, civilization–if you want to call it that—depended almost entirely on exploitation. It needed an upper class that took from the peasants and craft-workers enough of the stuff they produced to give the elite a better-than-desperately-poor standard of living, and also allow them, most of the time, to maintain control.</p><p>Once people began to farm, especially farm grains, they become relatively stationary: Agriculturalists cannot carry their resources away with them. Their wealth is in their land and the crops they are growing, rather than in their heads and in the tools they carry. Thus farmers cannot run away when thugs-with-spears show up, and demand half their crop.</p><p>Before 1870, there was no possibility that humanity could bake an economic pie that was sufficiently large for everyone to potentially have enough. Slow technological progress, the necessity under patriarchy of trying to have more sons in the hope that at least one would survive, and natural resource scarcity—those put mankind under the Malthusian harrow, in dire poverty. Thus most of governance back then, and most social energy back then, was directed at some elite's (a) running a force-and-fraud, exploitation-and-domination machine, (b) elbowing other potential elites out of the way, and then (c) utilizing their ill-gotten gains in building a high culture in which the non-élite were villains and churns. The pressures making for human inequality, and for gross human inequality, were enormous and inescapable.</p><p>Thus, for most of recorded human history, history as studied by non-"presentist" historians consisted of this: studying how those who benefited from the operation of the exploitation-and-domination machine cooperated in building and enjoying their high culture and came into conflict within and between civilizations, as they carried out their respective roles as masters, thugs-with-spears (and later thugs-with-gunpowder-weapons), order-giving bureaucrats, record-keeping accountants, and propagandists.</p><p>Thus "modes of domination" were as important as modes of production, at least, in the old days. And thus there are four other dimensions of global economic history worth noting at this point—all having to do with inequality and distribution.</p><ul><li><p>The first is the extraction-status dimension: slavery, serfdom, &amp; lesser degrees of status unfreedom.</p></li><li><p>The second is the general within-society across-household inequality dimension: plutocracy.</p></li><li><p>The third is the gender dimension: patriarchy</p></li><li><p>And the fourth is the cross-country inequality dimension: divergence (of national economies).</p></li></ul><p>That humanity was unequal does not mean that the upper class back then was rich. It does not mean that the standard of living of the upper class back in the Agrarian Age would really impress us. They may have been famous. But from our standpoint they were not really rich.</p><p>For one thing, life expectancy was short, even for the upper class: 20 to 30 at birth, rather than our 80 or so. Some plague might will get you. And if you were female, childbed might will get you as well. Of British queens, one in seven in the years from 1000 up to 1650 died in childbed. Males escaped childbed mortality, and also by-and-large escaped the extra mortality from nursing sick children with infectious diseases. But if you were male or unlucky and&nbsp; female you faced risks from human violence. 1/3 of English monarchs from William the Conqueror up to 1650 either died in battle, were assassinated, or were murdered after some sham show of judicial process. Probably the risks of violent death at the hands of others were lower for people who were not so eminent. Probably.</p><p>For another, lots of things that we think of as nice to have, but not as especially crucial or key or even valuable, were way out of their reach of even the richest during and after the Agrarian age. Suppose you lived in 1610. Suppose you wanted, in your house, to watch a horror movie—strike that, no movies: a horror play—something about witches or devils or such, and wanted to watch it in your house. One person in all the island of Great Britain could do that. If you wanted to do that, you had better be named James I Stuart, you had better be King of England and Scotland, and your acting company had better have either Shakespeare’s MacBeth or Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus in repertory.</p><p>And before: If you were Gilgamesh, King of Uruk in the year -3000, What could you do? You could boss people around yes–get the men to build walls and canals and to drill as soldiers, and get the women to serve and service you. You could drink beer—wine and distillation had not yet been invented. You could eat flatbread or porridge. You could eat meat every day—which your subjects could eat only rarely. You could eat honey—which few people could do. And honey was important: do we have any Melissas or Deborahs out there?</p><p>You could sit on cushions stuffed with wool.</p><p>But, for Gilgamesh, to even get cedar or some other wood for your walls or floors—that required a major military expedition. With associated transport logistics.</p><p>Back then, in the Agrarian Age, human technological progress was glacially slow. And here there is a puzzle. For progress and sophistication in the arts, in politics, in religion, in social Organization—ancient Athens even heard its equivalent of keeping up with the Kardashians, only the star was named Phryne and not Kim. But not just in the level of technology but in the pace of technological advance, we moderns far outstrip the ancients in a way that we do not In, say, composing poetry.</p><p></p><p>Once people began to farm, especially farm grains, they become relatively stationary: Agriculturalists cannot carry their resources away with them.

An unequal society is one in which those at the bottom get to make use of a small share of society’s resources. It is one in which the work they must do to gain access to that small amount and share is lengthy and burdensome.</p><p>Of course all of this is for males of the proper ethnicity—the proper semi- or completely-fictional extended kin-group. They werepretty much the only people who fully counted. Slaves were unequal. Women were unequal. In the United States Amerindians—if they had survived the plagues and the wars and the forced migrations—were unequal. Even among American white men, non-slaveholders in the slave south had very little societal power: If they ran their own farms, they had to sell their produce into a market in which slave-grown corn and slave-raised pigs were determining the prices that they could get. If they sought to work for others, they had to sell their labor into a market in which their potential employers' competitors would be using and driving their slaves with the whip, and thus pushing down the wages that their own employers could afford to pay.</p><p>Income and extraction closely interlinked with status…</p><p>Once again, let us consider Aristoteles of Stageira, sometime tutor of Alexandros III “The Great” Argeádai of Macedon”. For 2000 years, from the moment he became the favored pupil of Plato up until call it the year 1650, and in a long arc from Ireland to India, Aristotle was THE Philosopher. Capital P. THE definite article. If you said “the&nbsp; philosopher”, you were referring to Aristotle. And people did.

The <em>Politics</em> is about how prosperous and wealthy Greek men organize themselves and their inferiors into city-states that provide an arena and support for life and, of course, for the practice of philosophy. The first book—actually, for him it was the first scroll—Of the politics is about economics, or rather resources and household management, because unless resources and the households Controlled by prosperous and wealthy Greek men Are present and well organized, successful organization of a city state, of a polity, will be impossible.</p><p>In the first book of his <em>Politic</em>s, Aristotle talks about the necessity of owning slaves. It is, in fact, The first thing on his mind when he talks about managing resources on the part of the household—Greek <em>oikos</em>, household, and Greek <em>nomos</em>, organization or management.

He, Aristotle, did not have robot blacksmiths or the self-propelled serving trays that could both keep the food warm and decide when it should be brought into the dining room, things that myth attributed to the lifestyles of the heroic and divine. Since he did not have these, Aristotle, or any other Greek man who wanted to lead a leisurely enough life to have time to undertake <em>philosophy</em>, and play a proper role in the self-governance of the city-state, needed to own and&nbsp; effectively boss slaves.</p><p>And not just one or two slaves either, but household slaves, agricultural slaves, craft work or slaves, and perhaps more.</p><p>And also note that, once again, this is income, not status and caste.</p><p>It is, throughout human history, very important not to lose sight of status and caste.</p><p>Simple income accounts tend to record the United States on the eve of the Civil War as an extraordinarily equal society with its top 1% white non-Amerindian guys having 4-6 times the lifetime income of the average white, male, non-Amerindian.</p><p>But there were four million slaves among the 30 million inhabitants of the U.S. in 1860. They had the strongest possible objections to that claim that the U.S. was then significantly less unequal than Britain.</p><p>From their perspective—and, I would hope, from ours—the fact that the richest white male non-Amerindian had only 5 rather than the then-European 25 times the lifetime income of the average white male non-Amerindian is not the most important feature of American inequality on the eve of the Civil War. The most important fact is, as Abraham Lincoln said in 1858 at the end of his speech at Ottawa, IL. He was softening his words in order to appeal to the non-abolitionist white male electorate of Illinois. And he said that even though:</p><blockquote><p>I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races…. Inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position. I have never said anything to the contrary…</p></blockquote><p>Nevertheless:</p><blockquote><p>I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. [Loud cheers.] I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man. I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respects-certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.</p></blockquote><p>No. The Pre-Civil War United States was not a low inequality society. The coming of emancipation in 1863 and 1865 was a huge thing for economic and social equality. The coming of feminism, even early feminism, was a substantial thing for social equality if not for economic.</p><p>Pre-industrial northwest Europe, by contrast, was a slavery-free but an income-inequality abundant society. The top 1% (of males) at any point in time had 15-20 times the income of the average—figure 10-15 times the lifetime inequality. In both the Netherlands and Britain, figure that at any point in time from 1860 to 1930 the top 1% had incomes 20-30 times the average.</p><p>A great deal of inequality, however, is not just work, income, spending, and prices. A great deal is simply things that you are not allowed to do, or are expected and required to do, by virtue of what we might as well call your status-group, your estate, your caste. Minorities. Serfs. Slaves.</p><p>This is always present as a background in economic analysis. But this is usually much more than a background factor in human societies. I am not a great fan of those who try to distinguish wealth from freedom—power to command resources from autonomy—positive from negative liberty—in human societies. If you are locked in a cage, it matters a little to you whether you could buy a key if only you had the more money which you do not. So never take a distribution of wealth or income as in any sense a set of sufficient statistics for inequality.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Inequality &amp; Plutocracy</strong></p><p>How important?</p><p>Branko Milanovic, Peter Lindert, and Jeffrey Williamson have estimated some numbers and drawn some graphs about inequality back in the agrarian age—that is, from 8000 B.C.E. to 1750 or so. It looks as though societies were by and large about as unequal as they could possibly be. Paying higher taxes or higher rents or higher tithes than were levied may indeed have meant that large numbers of children would die. Extracting more wealth would not have been an easy thing for an elite comprised of thugs with swords and grifters with fancy sacred headdresses to accomplish.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93a70a2d-ef13-445b-81d5-3cfc8fb66e8f_324x306.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93a70a2d-ef13-445b-81d5-3cfc8fb66e8f_324x306.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93a70a2d-ef13-445b-81d5-3cfc8fb66e8f_324x306.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93a70a2d-ef13-445b-81d5-3cfc8fb66e8f_324x306.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93a70a2d-ef13-445b-81d5-3cfc8fb66e8f_324x306.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/93a70a2d-ef13-445b-81d5-3cfc8fb66e8f_324x306.png" width="724" height="683.7777777777778" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/93a70a2d-ef13-445b-81d5-3cfc8fb66e8f_324x306.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:306,&quot;width&quot;:324,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:724,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;pastedGraphic.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;pastedGraphic.png&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="pastedGraphic.png" title="pastedGraphic.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93a70a2d-ef13-445b-81d5-3cfc8fb66e8f_324x306.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93a70a2d-ef13-445b-81d5-3cfc8fb66e8f_324x306.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93a70a2d-ef13-445b-81d5-3cfc8fb66e8f_324x306.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93a70a2d-ef13-445b-81d5-3cfc8fb66e8f_324x306.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Our societies have much more headroom, and can sustain much more inequality than they could. Nevertheless, most pre-industrial societies appear to have had inequality nearly as great as could have possibly been sustained.</p><p>Starting in 1725 or so we begin to see, for the first time, claims that inequality is actually functional, and makes some sense for society as a whole—rather than natural, and part of the right order of things. We may have seen this once or twice before—Aristotle’s justification of slavery for example. But that the industrious need to be properly incentivized to work hard by the prospect of the coming rich and this becoming rich redounds to the benefit of society as a whole—that is something we first see in full flower in the 18th century. Probably the reason is that it only becomes a question in the 18th century. Before the 18th century there were not enough poor people who could read for inequality to need justification.</p><p>The latest historical inequality numbers—even more recent than those of Thomas Piketty—come from Peter Lindert and Jeffrey Williamson. They tell us that America in the 1600s and 1700s in America the top 1% had 8-10 times the average income, rather than the 15-30 times average income found in northwest Europe. Today in the U.S., the top 1%—roughly those households with incomes more than $500K/year—receive (I don’t want to say “earn”) 20 times the average.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F662e82fd-0711-4130-a31a-0e5e5bacd4bd_324x234.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F662e82fd-0711-4130-a31a-0e5e5bacd4bd_324x234.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F662e82fd-0711-4130-a31a-0e5e5bacd4bd_324x234.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F662e82fd-0711-4130-a31a-0e5e5bacd4bd_324x234.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F662e82fd-0711-4130-a31a-0e5e5bacd4bd_324x234.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/662e82fd-0711-4130-a31a-0e5e5bacd4bd_324x234.png" width="720" height="520" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/662e82fd-0711-4130-a31a-0e5e5bacd4bd_324x234.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:234,&quot;width&quot;:324,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:720,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;pastedGraphic_1.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;pastedGraphic_1.png&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="pastedGraphic_1.png" title="pastedGraphic_1.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F662e82fd-0711-4130-a31a-0e5e5bacd4bd_324x234.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F662e82fd-0711-4130-a31a-0e5e5bacd4bd_324x234.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F662e82fd-0711-4130-a31a-0e5e5bacd4bd_324x234.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F662e82fd-0711-4130-a31a-0e5e5bacd4bd_324x234.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Note, however, that the top 1% are overwhelmingly 40 to 60 years old.

And how is it that it is this category of income that has been so greatly amplified in the Second Gilded age: the overclass share is now 2/3 greater than it was even back in the first Gilded Age.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f3dc2ac-c730-49c5-b3b4-d5eafab46fd3_324x243.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f3dc2ac-c730-49c5-b3b4-d5eafab46fd3_324x243.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f3dc2ac-c730-49c5-b3b4-d5eafab46fd3_324x243.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f3dc2ac-c730-49c5-b3b4-d5eafab46fd3_324x243.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f3dc2ac-c730-49c5-b3b4-d5eafab46fd3_324x243.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f3dc2ac-c730-49c5-b3b4-d5eafab46fd3_324x243.png" width="706" height="529.5" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f3dc2ac-c730-49c5-b3b4-d5eafab46fd3_324x243.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:243,&quot;width&quot;:324,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:706,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;pastedGraphic_2.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;pastedGraphic_2.png&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="pastedGraphic_2.png" title="pastedGraphic_2.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f3dc2ac-c730-49c5-b3b4-d5eafab46fd3_324x243.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f3dc2ac-c730-49c5-b3b4-d5eafab46fd3_324x243.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f3dc2ac-c730-49c5-b3b4-d5eafab46fd3_324x243.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f3dc2ac-c730-49c5-b3b4-d5eafab46fd3_324x243.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>5% of national income for 0.01% of the population means that these 15,000 households collectively have 500 times average income.

Three factors have not: “bad trade deals”, low-education immigration, and affirmative action.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Patriarchy</strong></p><p>Agrarian-age patriarchal inequality is literally inscribed in our genes.</p><p>It is an elementary fact of our genetics that there is a small proportion of our genome—the mitochondrial DNA genome—that we inherit only from our mothers. Thus we can trace descent back through the exclusively female line, and by looking at the amount of mutations and genetic divergence in a human population today in that portion of the genome, determine the effective female population size of the human race back in the past all the way back to mitochondrial Eve: the woman who is the mother's mother's mother's... mother's mother's mother of us all. And It is an elementary fact of our genetics that there is a small proportion of every male's genome—the y-chromosome genome—that we inherit only from our fathers. Thus we can trace descent of males back through the exclusively male line, and by looking at the amount of mutations and genetic divergence in a human population today in that portion of the genome, determine the effective male population size of the human race back in the past all the way back to y-chromosome Adam: the father who is our father's father's father's... father's father's father of us all.</p><p>When we do this, we find something going on between the years -8000 and -2000. The effective female population size becomes much much much much larger than the effective male population size in that era. Lots of mitochondrial lineages are coming down to us: women are having daughters who have daughters... whose daughters' daughters' daughters are among us. A much smaller number of y-chromosome lineages are being evolved and then surviving—perhaps 1/20 as large. This would seem to mean that 10000 to 2000 years ago something exterminated most of the y-chromosome lineages. saw substantial polygyny for a few men, and non-reproduction for others. It also means the inheritance of male reproductive advantage: that if your great-grandfather had the resources to have more than one wife, the odds were higher that you were at the top of the inequality pyramid and had the resources more than one wife as well. Patriarchal reproductive inequality was in that age both substantial and inherited.</p><p>This is polygyny: one man, many wives—and lots of men with no wives and little sexual access to women. This is the Biblical Patriarch Jacob: 13 children with two wives and two concubines. Jacob and Leah's children were Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah Issachar, Zebulun, and Dina; Jacob and Rachel's children were Joseph and Benjamin; Jacob and Zilpah's children were Gad and Asher, and Jacob and Bilhah's children were Dan and Naphtali. And somewhere in the neighborhood there were three men—unnamed—who were without wives, and without children. Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah's mitochondrial DNA lineages were passed down. The three nameless men's y-chromosome lineages were not: only Jacob's was.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82cffa65-4abd-4272-b25a-d6b9bd3a270b_324x309.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82cffa65-4abd-4272-b25a-d6b9bd3a270b_324x309.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82cffa65-4abd-4272-b25a-d6b9bd3a270b_324x309.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82cffa65-4abd-4272-b25a-d6b9bd3a270b_324x309.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82cffa65-4abd-4272-b25a-d6b9bd3a270b_324x309.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82cffa65-4abd-4272-b25a-d6b9bd3a270b_324x309.png" width="714" height="680.9444444444445" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82cffa65-4abd-4272-b25a-d6b9bd3a270b_324x309.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:309,&quot;width&quot;:324,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:714,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;pastedGraphic_3.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;pastedGraphic_3.png&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="pastedGraphic_3.png" title="pastedGraphic_3.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82cffa65-4abd-4272-b25a-d6b9bd3a270b_324x309.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82cffa65-4abd-4272-b25a-d6b9bd3a270b_324x309.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82cffa65-4abd-4272-b25a-d6b9bd3a270b_324x309.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82cffa65-4abd-4272-b25a-d6b9bd3a270b_324x309.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Maintaining polygyny for a number of generations requires great social pressure and great societal inequality among men. It also requires a great deal of subservience among women. What was human life and human inequality like back in this patriarchal age? What brought it on? What made it come to an end?</p><p>In 1764, in Britain’s Massachusetts colony, Abigail Smith was 20. She had had no formal education at all: girls weren’t worth it. She married a man she had known for five years: the up-and-coming 30-year-old lawyer John Adams, future President of the United States. Children rapidly followed their marriage: Nabby (1765), John Quincy (1767), Suky (1768, died at 2), Charles (1770, died at 10), Thomas (1772), probably a miscarriage or two or three from 1774-6, then Elizabeth (1777, stillborn), then (perhaps) another miscarriage—but I suspect not. She spent five years pregnant. She was rich enough that she, probably, hired a wet-nurse for her children, but somebody or somebodies nursed her children for perhaps fourteen more years: some woman or women were thus eating for two for more than a full decade to raise the next generation of Adamses. In 1776 she writes a famous letter to her husband in which she begged him to write laws providing women with legal personality in the new revolutionary country he was building:</p><blockquote><p>Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable…. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands…. Such of you as wish to be happy willingly give up the harsh title of Master for the more tender and endearing one of Friend. Why then, not put it out of the power of the vicious and the Lawless to use us with cruelty and indignity with impunity?… Regard us then as Beings placed by providence under your protection and in immitation of the Supreem Being make use of that power only for our happiness…</p></blockquote><p>Her husband John Adams thought this was a great joke:</p><blockquote><p>I cannot but laugh…. Your letter was the first intimation that another tribe, more numerous and powerful than all the rest, were grown discontented. This is rather too coarse a compliment, but you are so saucy, I won't blot it out. Depend upon it, we know better than to repeal our masculine systems…. We have only the name of masters, and rather than give up this, which would completely subject us to the despotism of the petticoat, I hope General Washington and all our brave heroes would fight…</p></blockquote><p>Read the letter entire &lt;<a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-01-02-0241">https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-01-02-0241</a>&gt;.</p><p>Why male supremacy was so firmly established is something that is not obvious to me. Yes, it was very important to have surviving descendants. Yes, attaining a reasonable chance of having surviving descendants to take care of one in one’s old age meant that the typical woman spent 20 years eating for two: pregnant and breastfeeding. Yes, eating for two is an enormous energy drain, especially in populations near subsistence. Yes, prolonged breastfeeding was a substantial mobility drain kept women very close to their children, and impelled a concentration of female labor on activities that made that easy: gardening and other forms of within-and-near-the-dwelling labor, especially textiles. Yes, there were benefits to men as a group from oppressing women—especially if women could be convinced that they deserved it:</p><blockquote><p>Unto the woman he said, ‘I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband; and he shall rule over thee’…</p></blockquote><p>But surely women as equal participants in society, rather than just chattels, classified as a little bit above slaves and cattle, can do a lot. We—optimistic—economists have a strong bias toward believing that people in groups will find ways to become, collectively, more productive and then to distribute the fruits of higher productivity in a way that makes such a more productive social order sustainable. But apparently not.</p><p>The bio-demographic underpinnings of the cultural pattern of high male supremacy began to erode even before 1870. But it was over 1870-2016 that these underpinnings dissolved. Reductions in infant mortality, the advancing average age of marriage, and the increasing costs of child raising together drove a decrease in fertility. The number of years the typical woman spent eating for two fell from twenty—if she survived her childbed—down to four, as better sanitation, much better nutrition, and more knowledge about disease made many pregnancies less necessary for leaving surviving descendants, and as birth control technology made it easier to plan families. And, after exploding in the Industrial Age, the rate of population growth in the industrial core slowed drastically. The population explosion turned out to be a relatively short-run thing. Human population growth rapidly headed for zero long-run population growth.</p><p>The path of within-the-household technological advance also worked to the benefit of the typical woman over 1870-2016: dishwashers, dryers, vacuum cleaners, improved chemical cleansing products, other electrical and natural gas appliances, and so on, especially clothes-washing machines—all these made the tasks of keeping the household clean, ordered, and functioning much easier. Maintaining a nineteenth-century, high-fertility household was a much more than full-time job. Maintaining a late twentieth-century household could become more like a part-time job. And so much female labor that had been tied to full-time work within the household because of the backward state of household technology became a reserve that could now be used for other purposes. And, as Betty Friedan wrote in the early 1960s, women who sought something like equal status could find it only if they found “identity…in work… for which, usually, our society pays.” As long as women were confined to separate, domestic, occupations which the market did not reward with cash, it was easy for men to denigrate and minimize.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Global Divergence</strong></p><p>In 1870, when the long twentieth century began, British industry stood at the leading edge of economic and technological progress, and the world’s real income per capita had reached perhaps $6,000 a year. However, that was already at least double what was found anywhere outside the 400-mile radius charmed circle centered on the British port of Dover, plus Britain’s overseas settler colonies, and the United States, its ex-colony. Outside this nascent global north, our standard estimates show annual income per capita levels with a spread of a factor of five, ranging from $600 in the poorer parts of Africa to $3,000 in those European economies about to join the global north. The curve is heavily weighted toward the lower end, because China and India were then in the down-phase of the Malthusian cycle. The average per capita annual income level within the global south alone was perhaps $1,300.</p><p>By 1911 the world had grown—largely together. Global-south incomes were now spread by a factor of almost six, ranging from $700 to $4,000—with Russia, fueled by French loan capital to build its railways, in the lead. The global-south center of gravity had inched up to perhaps $1,500. But the Global North had forged ahead too.</p><p>What happened then was strikingly at variance with the expectations of neoclassical, neoliberal, and neoliberal-adjacent economists like myself, who hold that discovery is—or should be—more difficult than development, that development is more difficult than deployment, and so that the world economy should “converge” over time. Between 1911 and 1990 that did not happen. The opposite did: the world economy diverged to a stunning degree. The economies of the Global South did not catch up to, or even keep pace with, the fast-runners of economic growth and development.</p><p>The global south did grow, by and large. But it did not catch up. Latin America lost a decade of development in the 1980s. As of the early 2020s, Chile and Panama are the only Latin American countries that are better off than China, while Mexico, Costa Rica, and Brazil are China’s rough equals. In Africa, only Botswana. In Asia, only Japan, the Four Tigers—South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore—Malaysia, and Thailand. The gap between China and the global north is still a factor of about 3.5 to 1. It was not all disappointing: progress in education and health was rapid and extremely heartening. But that did not hide the disappointing growth in material production.</p><p>And Africa has fallen way, way behind: South Africa, Kenya, Zambia, Ghana, and Nigeria—all those for which in the 1960s there were great expectations for economic development—have fallen well short of their promise.</p><p>In 1950, more than half the world’s population still lived in extreme poverty: at the living standard of our typical pre-industrial ancestors. By 1990 it was down to a quarter. By 2010 it would be less than 12 percent. And in 1950, most of this extreme poverty was spread throughout the global south. Thereafter it would become concentrated in Africa, where, by 2010, some three-fifths of the world’s extreme poor would reside. This concentration came as a surprise: there had been few signs back in the late colonial days of palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, and cocoa exports—the days when Zambia was more industrialized than, and almost as rich as, Portugal—that Africa south of the Sahara would fall further and further behind, and not just behind the global north, but behind the rest of the global south as well. Thinkers like Nathan Nunn grappled with this data and concluded that this retardation had something to do with the massive slave trades that had afflicted Africa in previous years.</p><p>The first post-colonial African head of government to have been assassinated was Nigerian prime minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. He had been born in the north of the British colony of Nigeria in 1912 and had been sent to boarding school at Katsina College. There, he was student number 145, to be slotted into the imperial bureaucracy as a teacher of English. He did very well. By 1941 he was a headmaster. In 1944 he was sent to University College London, to be trained to become a schools inspector for the colonial administration.</p><p>But earlier, back when he was twenty-two, in 1934, a colonial official named Rupert East had commissioned five novellas, to be written in Hausa, in an attempt to spread literacy. In his short novel <em>Shaihu Umar</em> (<em>Wise Umar</em>), the protagonist’s students distract him from teaching them the <em>Quran</em> by asking him how he came to be a teacher. The story that follows is of his enslavement and its consequences: large-scale slave raids, kidnappings, adoptions by childless slavers, and more kidnappings. The protagonist finally meets up with his mother (she has been kidnapped and enslaved too, by the guards she had hired) in Tripoli. She sees that he is pious and prosperous, and then she promptly dies. The vibe is that “people really will do terrible things for money”—and not for large amounts of money either—and that “the world is a Hobbesian war of all against all, but if you read the Quran really well, then you’ll probably prosper, maybe.”</p><p>In January 1966 he was murdered in the military coup led by the Young Majors—Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu and company—whose troops slaughtered senior politicians and their generals and their wives, and then were themselves suppressed by a countercoup led by army commander Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi. Aguiyi-Ironsi was assassinated six months later in a July counter-countercoup led by Yakuba Gowon. A year later the Igbo people declared the&nbsp; independent republic of Biafra, which was suppressed after a three-year war causing some 4 million deaths (out of a population of about 55 million), the overwhelming majority of them Igbo dead of starvation. Yakuba Gowon was overthrown by Murtala Muhammed in July 1975. And Murtala was then assassinated in February 19. A return to civilian rule in 1979 lasted only until 1983, when the next military coup took place in Nigeria.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a48b472-8d1b-421a-8b72-15cd03375873_1966x1100.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a48b472-8d1b-421a-8b72-15cd03375873_1966x1100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a48b472-8d1b-421a-8b72-15cd03375873_1966x1100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a48b472-8d1b-421a-8b72-15cd03375873_1966x1100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a48b472-8d1b-421a-8b72-15cd03375873_1966x1100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5a48b472-8d1b-421a-8b72-15cd03375873_1966x1100.png" width="1456" height="815" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5a48b472-8d1b-421a-8b72-15cd03375873_1966x1100.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:815,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Pasted Graphic 48.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Pasted Graphic 48.png&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Pasted Graphic 48.png" title="Pasted Graphic 48.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a48b472-8d1b-421a-8b72-15cd03375873_1966x1100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a48b472-8d1b-421a-8b72-15cd03375873_1966x1100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a48b472-8d1b-421a-8b72-15cd03375873_1966x1100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a48b472-8d1b-421a-8b72-15cd03375873_1966x1100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><p></p><h3>Efflorescences and Dark Ages</h3><p>And even though life back in the Agrarian Age was nasty brutish and short, it was not always the same. There were civilizational efflorescences. They were empires that brought peace and relative prosperity to large chunks of the land. There were also dark ages and barbarian invasions and civilization-shaking catastrophes as well. There was a history of economic growth and decline in the Agrarian Age: it was not all stasis and stagnation. We will consider those next time.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Late-Antiquity Pause</h3><p>Changes to the evolution of the human economy begin to emerge after the year 150. But the first change is not, from the standpoint of the potential for human progress, a good one.</p><p>Then from 150 or so to 800 it looks like we get a definite downshift: the Late-Antiquity Pause. We do not get a further acceleration to more than 0.06%/year of technology growth. We get a fall to a rate of 0.14%/year, a slower rate of technology growth than humanity had seen since before the start of the Bronze Age. Something goes wrong. There is the crisis of the Antonine Dynasty in the Roman Empire at one end, the collapse of the Han Empire at the other end, shortly followed by the collapse of the Parthian Empire and the Indo-Greek kingdoms under pressure a Sassanians, Kushans, Hephthalites, and others.</p><p>Instead of the near-tripling from the year 150 to the year 800 in population that the Axial Age of -1000 to 150 would have led us to expect, human population in 800 is only 20% above population in the year 150. Ideas growth—and population growth—slowed drastically. From 150 to 1500, each person on the globe contributed only 1/8 as much to ideas growth as their axial-age predecessors. And it was still the case that essentially all&nbsp; improvements in technology flowed through to increasing population, with essentially none flowing through to higher labor efficiency, productivity, and living standards for the typical human. The sources of this Late-Antiquity are a substantial mystery, surrounded by speculation, but with little in the way of solid knowledge.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Mediæval Recovery, Technological Breakout, and Dispelling the Ensorcellment of the Devil of Malthus</h3><p>But things then recover, somewhat: 800 to 1500 see technology growth recover to 0.05%/year. So progress in technological advance does, however, continue. By the year 1500 we have 𝐻 = 0.43. But we also have 500 million humans, compared to the 200 million of year 150 or the 5 million of year -6000. Typical standards of living in 1500? They still seem much the same: still 2.5 dollars a day.</p><p>Thereafter come the really big changes. Thereafter comes the breakout:</p><ul><li><p>a growth rate of useful ideas of 0.15% per year during the 1500-1770 Imperial-Commercial Revolution Age.</p></li><li><p>a growth rate of useful ideas of 0.44% per year during the 1770-1870 Industrial Revolution Age.</p></li><li><p>a growth rate of useful ideas averaging 2.06% per year during the post-1870 Modern Economic Growth Era.</p></li><li><p>a population explosion, and then a slowdown toward zero population growth as prosperity brings female education, female education brings greater female autonomy, and literate women with rights to own property find that there are other ways to gain and maintain social power than to try as hard as possible to become the mother of many sons and daughters.</p></li></ul><p>From 1500 to 1770 to 1870—over, first, the Imperial-Commercial Revolution and, second, the Industrial Revolution eras—our quantitative index H grows from 0.43 to 0.64 to 1.0. And this time there was some increase in typical standards of living: figure a world in 1870 with $3.5 a day per person, albeit much more unevenly distributed. But, still, the overwhelming bulk of improvements in human technology and organization went to supporting a larger population: the 500 million of 1500 had grown to 1.3 billion by 1870, as better living standards lowered death rates worldwide.</p><p>From 1870 to 2020, in our era of Modern Economic Growth, our H has risen from 1 to 27. Our population has risen from 1.3 to 8 billion. And our resources from $3.5 to $32 a day.</p><p>From this perspective, there are two big questions in post-Neolithic Revolution global economic history:</p><ol><li><p>Why was there and what determined the pace of the triple accelerations in growth to 0.15% and then 0.44% and now 2.06% per year?</p></li><li><p>Why was there and what determined the—much, much, much slower—pace of growth of 0.03% per year (with a -1000 to 1 temporary and with a post-800 perhaps permanent jump up) from the -3000 invention of writing to 1500?.</p></li></ol><p></p><p><strong>2.4.1. In Everything Except Economic Growth, They Were Like Us</strong></p><p>It could have been different. The rate of growth of human technology could have been faster, back in the Agrarian Age. They were capable of astonishing feats of intellectual creativity and precision metalwork. The Anti-Kythera mechanism blows the mind of modern researchers—both the astronomy of Hipparchus that it is based on, and the instantiation of Hipparchus’s ideas in a precision-metalworked device that <em>must</em> have been part of a tradition of such devices.</p><p>In rhetoric, Pericles and Demosthenes. In generalship, Caesar and Alexander. In governance, Augustus and Trajan. In philosophy, Aristotle and Xeno. In sculpture, in literature—even in making a living via presenting-yourself-as-a-celebrity, Phryne—Mnesarete daughter of Epicles of Thespiae—would have had nothing to learn from Kim Kardashian. Anyone who, 2000 years after your death, people are still writing poems about you assuming that readers will know that you were thought to have been the best life model for statues of Aphrodite-Venus…</p><p>They were us. And the Anti-Kythera mechanism underscores how much they were us in mechanical ingenuity and intellectual creativity. And yet… not. No age of the commercial revolution followed the Antonine Dynasty—or Iraq’s Abbasid, or the Han, or the Athenian Empire, or… a number of other efflorescences.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11af4443-5ab8-4326-b675-3b6203efaba7_1920x1080.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11af4443-5ab8-4326-b675-3b6203efaba7_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11af4443-5ab8-4326-b675-3b6203efaba7_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11af4443-5ab8-4326-b675-3b6203efaba7_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11af4443-5ab8-4326-b675-3b6203efaba7_1920x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/11af4443-5ab8-4326-b675-3b6203efaba7_1920x1080.png" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/11af4443-5ab8-4326-b675-3b6203efaba7_1920x1080.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Pasted Graphic 43.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Pasted Graphic 43.png&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Pasted Graphic 43.png" title="Pasted Graphic 43.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11af4443-5ab8-4326-b675-3b6203efaba7_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11af4443-5ab8-4326-b675-3b6203efaba7_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11af4443-5ab8-4326-b675-3b6203efaba7_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11af4443-5ab8-4326-b675-3b6203efaba7_1920x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The question is “why?” It is not that we are seeking an Industrial Revolution in Athens in the -300s, or in Rome in the 200s.</p><p><strong>2.4.2. Moses Finley's Theory</strong></p><p>The dominant theory of why pre-industrial technology-driven economic growth was so slow—of why the gap between Agrarian Age civilizational accomplishments (even if some of those are “accomplishments” in that they were the successful exertion of power, exercise of domination, and enforcement of slavery) in other areas of life and limited progress in technological advance-driven growth was so great—is that of Moses Finley. You can think of it as trying to put more flesh on the bones of this too-simple grand-narrative contrast between “developmental” and “extractive” institutions. This contrast is more than simply a contrast between a willingness to be patient, to invest for the future, and to share on the one hand, and the reverse on the other. But I am not sure that I have full control over the theory yet. So this section is, largely, a series of quotes stitched together.</p><p>Finley begins his argument with the observation that technological advance-driven growth in Agrarian-Age civilizations was small and slow:</p><blockquote><p>It is a commonplace that the Greeks and Romans together added little to the world's store of technical knowledge and equipment. The Neolithic and Bronze Ages between them invented or discovered, and then developed, the essential processes of agriculture, metallurgy, pottery, and textile-making. With these the Greeks and Romans built a high civilization, full of power and intellect and beauty, but they transmitted to their successors few new inventions. The gear and the screw, the rotary mill and the water-mill, the direct screw- press, glass-blowing and concrete, hollow bronze-casting, the dioptra for surveying, the torsion catapult, the water-clock and water organ, automata (mechanical toys) driven by water and wind and steam-this short list is fairly exhaustive, and it adds up to not very much for a great civilization over fifteen hundred years...</p></blockquote><p>This was not because Agrarian-Age élites did not like wealth. They loved wealth. (They loved honor and status too.) It is true that in the Agrarian Age’s last days, during the Mediæval Recovery, élites had an ambivalent attitude toward wealth on their deathbeds, at least in Christendom. But that came after the period Finley studies. In the iron, axial, classical age, wealth was a wonderful thing:</p><blockquote><p>The ancient world was very unambiguous about wealth. Wealth was a good thing, a necessary condition for the good life, and that was all there was to it. There was no nonsense about wealth as a trust, no subconscious guilt feelings, no death-bed restitutions of usury…</p></blockquote><p>Thus you cannot explain the absence of a focus on technology-driven growth by a civilizational unconcern with the wealth that it would have created:</p><blockquote><p>Intellectually (or scientifically) speaking, there was a basis for more technical advance-in production-than was actually made. Why did productivity then not advance markedly, if the interest, the knowledge, and the necessary intellectual energy would seem to have been present? The question cannot be dismissed simply by pointing to alternative values…</p></blockquote><p>The literary sources we have show a great suspicion of anyone who works too hard with their hands. To express too great an interest in the mechanics and techniques of production and transport, and of market negotiations, is to mark you as having a non-noble mind: the mind of a slave. And to avoid that sort of caste pollution was a major sociological objective of the rich:</p><blockquote><p>The pejorative judgments of ancient writers about labour, and specifically about the labour of the artisan, and of anyone who works for another, are too continuous, numerous, and unanimous, too wrapped up in discussions of every aspect of ancient life, to be dismissed as empty rhetoric.... Tocqueville['s]... notebooks... are filled with the theme that 'slavery is even more prejudicial to the masters than to the slaves', because, as a leading Louisville merchant said to him, 'it deprives us of the energy and spirit of enterprise that characterizes the States that have no slaves'. Greek and Roman slavery functioned in a different context, to be sure, both internally and externally, and comparisons must be made with caution and reserve. But this particular one seems to me to be valid and necessary...</p></blockquote><p>Is this just that literary intellectuals—rich landlords, and their clients who sought to please their patrons—were the writers, and that if we had the writings of merchants and manufacturers we would see a very different set of values applied to work and enterprise? Finley says “no”. Finley appeals to the fact that those in charge of society had very much the same view:</p><blockquote><p>From the second century on, the emperors were faced with continuing difficulties and crises in supplies and revenues. They had good reason to think of more production. That, instead, they thought of more regimentation, of a bigger bite out of the old pie, seems to me explicable largely in terms of attitudes, of thought-processes...</p></blockquote><p>It was not that there was a lack of interest in progress and invention, even. Inventions and innovations in military technology, in public works—roads, buildings, baths, utilities—were greatly valued. But not things that raised the productivity of the average worker:</p><blockquote><p>Archimedes’s practical inventions, I hasten to add, were military and were made only under the extraordinary and irresistible stimulus of the siege of his native Syracuse by the Romans…. Why did neither the Ptolemies nor the Sicilian tyrants nor the Roman emperors systematically (or even spasmodically) turn their engineers to the search for higher productivity, at least in those sectors of the economy which produced the royal revenues? Whatever the answer, it was not lack of capital (or lack of authority). Funds, manpower and technical skills were made available (and wasted) in vast and ever increasing amounts for roads, public buildings, water supply, drainage and other amenities, but not for production. Of course, the effort to increase productivity might have proved unsuccessful—but it was never even attempted…</p></blockquote><p>And he caps off an argument with an appeal to Aristotle’s attitude towards the “poor taste” or “crudity” of knowing <em>too much</em> about market conditions and production processes. You had to know <em>something</em>: you had to effectively boss your slaves and supervise your foremen, and since you could not produce everything on your own estates, you did have to trade, and so you needed to figure out what you needed your slaves to produce so that you could sell it to best advantage, and avoid getting cheated in market exchanges with your counterparties:</p><blockquote><p>At the end of the first section of the Politics (I 258b 33ff.), [Aristotle] wrote as follows (in Barker's translation): “A general account has now been given of the various forms of acquisition: to consider them minutely, and in detail, might be useful for practical purposes; but to dwell long upon them would be in poor taste…”. Aristotle was the greatest polymath of antiquity, a tireless researcher, and the founder of any number of new disciplines in science and philosophy. His curiosity was unbounded, but 'good taste', a moral category, interposed to put beyond the pale knowledge in its practical applications except when the application was ethical or political... Impossible as it is to lump the whole of ancient society into one generalization, it would not be far wrong to say that from the Homeric world to Justinian great wealth was landed wealth, that new wealth came from war and politics (including such by-products as tax-farming), not from enterprise, and that whatever was available for investment found its way into the land as quickly as it could…. The magnates drew large rents and profits from their estates… [and often] left the management and operation of their estates either to tenants or to slaves and slave bailiffs. In either case their psychology was that of the rentier, and hence neither their material circumstances nor their attitudes were favourable to innovation. They were not so stupid or so hide-bound that they could not abandon grain production for olive and vine cultivation or pasture when circumstances pressed them, or that they could not (sometimes) tell a better landed investment from a poorer one. But essentially their energies went into spending their wealth, not making it, and they spent it on politics and the good life...</p></blockquote><p>The key for Finley lies in the fact that what the Agrarian Age, or at least Classical Antiquity, established and developed was a slave society. Any society in which your working class is slaves is going to be one in which work is systematically degraded and scorned. Why? Because if the slaves are not degraded and scorned, then it is very hard for the slaveholders to psychologically justify what they are doing to themselves. They must think that they are tyrants seated on the throne of skulls—cruel and inhuman masters.</p><p>Only if those who do the work are dirty and degraded and deserve to be treated poorly can such an élite live easily with itself.</p><p>Finley’s conclusion is that an exploitative-landlord orientation dominated Agrarian-Age thinking, and directed society’s energy and attention elsewhere. He closes with an appeal to David Hume’s observation that ancient cities were centers of control, domination, and consumption, and not of production and enterprise. History was not made of élites using social power to develop and evolve modes of production, but rather modes of domination:</p><blockquote><p>On the larger issue David Hume saw the picture exactly, when he wrote: “I do not remember a passage in any ancient author, where the growth of a city is ascribed to the establishment of a manu- facture. The commerce, which is said to flourish, is chiefly the exchange of those commodities, for which different soils and climates were suited…”. Servile and other forms of dependent labour were very profitable. Such changes as occurred in the Roman Empire in the position of the wealthy were political, not economic, and therefore they had no significant incentive to alter the productive arrangements. In the end, it was the military and political breakdown of the Empire which drove the western aristocracy back onto their estates and to the beginnings of a manorial system…</p></blockquote><p>All these from: <strong>Moses Finley</strong>: <em>Technical Progress and Economic Innovation in the Ancient World</em><a href="https://delong.typepad.com/finley-technical.pdf">https://delong.typepad.com/finley-technical.pdf</a>:</p><p>Is this right? Or is what Moses Finley sees as the Agrarian-Age élite <em>mentalité</em> simply the particular ideological position of a landlord-intellectual group, one that sees the growing mercantile and commercial prosperity of Athens in the -300s, and seeks to counter its influence as (a) philosophically bad in focusing people not on how to live life but how to become superrich, and (b) politically bad in undermining the authority of the landlords who ought to have great influence in running the city-state? That is definitely a question. I do not think I know enough to even semi-definitively answer it.</p><p><strong>2.4.3. Might Finley Be Wrong? Seneca vs. Posidonius on Whether Technology Is Philosophy</strong></p><p>Let me add a coda here, about the attitude of the Græco-Roman elite. Here we have Stoic philosopher and the childhood tutor of Nero Claudius Cæsar—the Roman Emperor Nero—Lucius Annius Seneca. Seneca says that philosophy is not the source of technology—and should not be expected to be. Seneca says that… well, this becomes weird: he is a Roman Senator, a member of a privileged class each one of whom was richer than any previous king save for the Seleukids, Ptolemaids, and Haxamanishya, a class who competed with one another in luxury-display, saying that technology is the fruit of luxury and the luxury that I and my class partake of is a bad thing.</p><p>Seneca goes on, and he names his target. He is debating a man who in Seneca’s day had been dead for a hundred years and more, the earlier Stoic philosopher Posidonius of Rhodes. Posidonius had said that men of wisdom invented tools and found resources. Seneca said not: that tools and resources were discovered by someone “whose mind was nimble and keen, but not great or exalted… [with] a bent body and… gaze is upon the ground…”</p><p>And Seneca winds up with the Stoic commonplace: happiness is attained by limiting your desires, not by fulfilling them, and if all listened to sages humanity would be wise and “the cook [would be] as superfluous as the soldier”…</p><p>How seriously to take Seneca here is an interesting question. Here is the relevant passage:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Lucius Annaeus Seneca Minor</strong>&nbsp;(64):&nbsp;<strong>Moral Letters to Lucilius</strong> 90: <em>On the Part Played by Philosophy in the Progress of Man</em>: ‘That philosophy discovered the arts of which life makes use in its daily round I refuse to admit…. I, for my part, do not hold that philosophy devised these shrewdly-contrived dwellings of ours which rise story upon story, where city crowds against city, any more than that she invented the fish-preserves, which are enclosed for the purpose of saving men’s gluttony from having to run the risk of storms….</p><p>Was it philosophy that taught the use of keys and bolts? Nay, what was that except giving a hint to avarice?… All this sort of thing was born when luxury was being born…</p><p>On another point also I differ from Posidonius, when he holds that mechanical tools were the invention of wise men…. Nay, the sort of men who discover such things are the sort of men who are busied with them…. The hammer [and] the tongs… were both invented by some man whose mind was nimble and keen, but not great or exalted; and the same holds true of any other discovery which can only be made by means of a bent body and of a mind whose gaze is upon the ground….</p><p>Which man, pray, do you deem the wiser—the one who invents a process for spraying saffron perfumes to a tremendous height from hidden pipes, who fills or empties canals by a sudden rush of waters, who so cleverly constructs a dining-room with a ceiling of movable panels that it presents one pattern after another, the roof changing as often as the courses,—or the one who proves to others, as well as to himself, that nature has laid upon us no stern and difficult law when she tells us that we can live without the marble-cutter and the engineer, that we can clothe ourselves without traffic in silk fabrics, that we can have everything that is indispensable to our use, provided only that we are content with what the earth has placed on its surface? If mankind were willing to listen to this sage, they would know that the cook is as superfluous to them as the soldier….</p><p>Posidonius then passes on to the farmer…. This trade also, he declares, is the creation of the wise,—just as if cultivators of the soil were not even at the present day discovering countless new methods of increasing the soil’s fertility!… He even degrades the wise man by sending him to the mill…. Posidonius came very near declaring that even the cobbler’s trade was the discovery of the wise man….</p><p>Not so; these early inventions were thought out by no other class of men than those who have them in charge to-day. We know that certain devices have come to light only within our own memory… windows which admit the clear light through transparent tiles,.. baths with pipes let into their walls for the purpose of diffusing the heat… marble… rounded and polished masses of stone…. Or our signs for whole words, which enable us to take down a speech, however rapidly uttered, matching speed of tongue by speed of hand?</p><p>All this sort of thing has been devised by the lowest grade of slaves…</p></blockquote><p>More interesting, perhaps, is that there is here a debate.</p><p>Who was Posidonius of Rhodes? How many people agreed with him, agreed that philosophy should focus substantially on technology?</p><p>All 50 or so of his books are lost.</p><p>There is a story that when Pompey—Gnæus Pompeius Magnus, one of the two men on whom the historian Gaius Sallustius Crispus blames the Roman Civil War that destroyed the Roman Republic and created the Roman Empire (for Pompey would never accept that anyone could be his equal, while Cæsar would never accept that anyone could be his superior)—when Pompey came to Rhodes, he went to Posidonius’s house and there he <em>lowered his fasces</em>.</p><p>The <em>fasces</em> were the preeminent symbol of authority in the Roman Republic. It’s a bundle of sticks (and, for a military commander, axes too) tied together with leather thongs. The idea was that each individual stick is weak, as each individual Roman is weak, but if the sticks are tied together with leather thongs they are strong, just as the united Roman Republic is a very strong. Each Roman magistrate with authority to issue commands, with imperium, had attendants who carried their fasces as a visual reminder that it was Romans’ willingness to unite and obey the constitutional authority of magistrates that lay at the foundation of things.</p><p>(By the way, if you look at proceedings in the U.S. House of Representatives? You can see two enormous fasces on the back wall, flanking Nancy Pelosi. And, yes, this was where Benito Mussolini got the idea for the name of his Fascist Party.)</p><p>At any event, when Pompey came through Rhodes, he visited Posidonius, and gave Posidonius the salute that a more minor magistrate gives to a superior magistrate with the maior imperium, with the greater power to command.</p><p>Posidonius’s estimate of the circumference of the earth was one off by 4%. Posidonius’s estimate of the distance to the sun was, unfortunately, off by a power of 2.</p><p>Moses Finley’s take on the life-world and intellectual orientation of the resource-controlling elites who would have had to fund and reward a technological push may well be correct. But what he sees as the dominant view was not the universal view, as the existence of Posidonius of Rhodes demonstrates.</p><p><strong>2.4.4. Other Theories</strong></p><p>Moses Finley’s theory of slow technological progress, however, is not universally accepted. And the debate over why Agrarian-Age technological progress was so slow—why the gap between other civilizational and technological-progress accomplishments was so great—gets tied up with the argument over why there was a Late-Antiquity Pause.</p><p>From Peter Temin’s perspective, there is no puzzle in the slow growth of technology back in the Agrarian Age. Over 1870 to 2010, an average population of 3.5 billion saw ideas grow at a 2% per year rate. Over 1770 to 1870, an average population of 900 million saw ideas grow at a 0.5% per year rate. Over 1500 to 1770, an average population of 600 million so ideas grow at an 0.15% per year rate. Over year 1 to year 1500, an average population of 250 million saw ideas grow at an 0.05% per year rate. For Temin, people slowly become increasingly effective at generating new technologies: for each billion people on the globe, we generate 0.2%/year of technology growth in the 1-1500 Late Agrarian Age, 0.25%/year in the 1500-1770 Imperial-Commercial Age, 0.5%/year in the British Industrial Revolution Age, 1770-1870, and 0.6%/year in the post-1870 Modern Economic Growth Age.</p><p>Thus, for Temin, the big jump up comes with the British Industrial Revolution—coal and steam and textiles and iron—and those required the peculiar resources and factor price situation of Britain in the 1700s to trigger.</p><p>Peter Temin tends to take the first possibility that technological progress is really hard, that there weren't all that many of them and they could not communicate all that well. And perhaps more important, it is that there is something unique about coal. Had things politically and biologically had broken differently, perhaps we would have had a 1500-1770 Imperial-Commercial Age rate of growth in the late Roman Empire and for a ways beyond. But the key breakthrough to our rate of technological advance lies in the path taken through England in the 1700s.</p><p>For Temin, also, the Late-Antiquity Pause is easy to understand: the collapse of law-and-order, and the consequent collapse in investment and in the ability to organize things and trade are all that you need to generate a Dark Age: “The decline of the Roman Empire led to a decline of both land taxes and land ownership. The growing chaos Wickham described precluded both activities. A better frame would have been to say that the society changed from one based on taxes to one based on personal service. What does it mean to own land if taxes on the land no longer sustain a government? Feudalism was the way out of this chaos. It is best seen as a way to organize defense in a violent world. There was not enough security for a central government to collect taxes and field a military force, and all action had to be local…”</p><p>We have Josiah Ober, who wants to critique Finley and say that the view that Finley takes on is the view of a certain group of Athenian aristocrats who were fearful of the expanding commercial economy of the Agean in the minus four hundreds and minus three hundreds, not just because a commercial mode of thought was hostile to philosophy and the properly understanding what the good things in life were. But because it gave social power to all kinds of people who really did not deserve to have social power, people who had made their money not by being aristocrats with a lineage of landholding lineage behind them, but by being clever and commercial. Once again, I do not have answers. Once again, I simply hand point out that here is a problem and an issue that they were after all, as smart as we are as sophisticated in so many of the areas of life as we are, and yet their rate of technological advance was absolute. glacial compared to ours their economy did not work for economic growth</p><p><strong>2.4.5. Institutions &amp; Classes in the Agrarian-Age</strong></p><p>On the other hand, there is an awful lot more going on here. This right graph is from a paper that my freshman roommate, Andrei Shleifer and I wrote back when we became professors at the end of the 19 eighties. And we were looking at economic prosperity as modeled by the growth of city sites in Europe between the year ten hundred and eighteen hundred before the Industrial Revolution took on. This graph is a residual scatter from a regression analysis. On the bottom, if we have how authoritarian, dominant absolutist in control of the society. The king or the prince is r. That is given what era it is, given what region you're in. What is thing, how surprised to see that the government is as absolutist. And it says concerned with power and weapons as it is. With the other end of the spectrum being a government with its concern with the rule of law, with checks on governmental power and with commerce. And on the vertical axis we have once again, given what's going on, on average in that region, given what's going on in that era. I was surprised. Are You at the change in the number of large cities that happens over that 15-year period. And what we see here, since what determines what's on this axis is a matter of political history and military luck. That, you know. If the king's acquire more power, your city's die. If the kings are constrained than if the government is much more interested in commerce. The thing, absolutely. Breweries. These are not the kind of big changes we would see if Malthus were completely right, if there were not a lot more going on there. And indeed there is a lot more going on here.</p><p>And it cannot all be modeled by these Malthusian terms, the inverse of the taste of luxury, the ratio of savings to depreciation, knowledge, sharing knowledge. There's a bunch else involving class struggle of class conflict than Flask hour going on, some of which we'll look at next.</p><p>Karl Polanyi: Aristotle Discovers the Economy</p><p><strong>Karl Polanyi</strong>: <em>Aristotle Discovers the Economy</em> <a href="https://delong.typepad.com/aristotlediscovers.pdf">https://delong.typepad.com/aristotlediscovers.pdf</a>:</p><p>In the philosophy of Aristotle the three prizes of fortune were: honor and prestige; security of life and limb; wealth. The first stands for privilege and homage, rank and precedence; the second ensures safety from open and secret enemies, treason and rebellion, the revolt of the slave, the overbearing of the strong, and even protection from the arm of the law; the third, wealth, is the bliss of proprietorship, mainly of heirloom or famed treasure. True, utilitarian goods, food and materials, accrue as a rule to the possessor of honor and security, but the glory outshines the goods. Poverty, on the other hand, goes with an inferior status; it involves working for one’s living, often at the bid- ding of others. The les^s restricted the bidding, the more abject the condition. Not so much manual labor—as the farmer’s ever respected position shows—but dependence upon another man’s personal whim and command causes the serving man to be despised. Again, the bare economic fact of a lower income is screened from view...</p><p>We must refer back to the texts.... Some of his key terms, notably kapeJike, metadosis and chrematistike, were misinterpreted in translation. Sometimes the error becomes subtle. <em>Kapelike</em>was rendered as the art of retail trade instead of the art of "commercial trade,” <em>chrematistike</em> as the art of money-making instead of that of supply, i.e., the procuring of the necessaries of life in kind. In another instance, the distortion is manifest: <em>metadosis</em> was taken to be exchange or barter, while patently meaning its opposite, namely, "giving one's share"....</p><p><em>Kapelike</em>, grammatically denotes the art of the <em>kapelos</em>. The meaning of <em>kapelos</em> as used by Herodotus in the middle of the fifth century, is broadly established as some kind of retailer, especially of food.... The invention of coined money was linked by Herodotus with the fact that the Lydians had turned <em>kapeloi</em>. Herodotus also recounts that Darius was nicknamed <em>kapelos</em>. Indeed, under him military stores may have begun the practice of retailing food. Eventually kapelos became synonymous with “trickster, fraud, cheat”.... <em>Kapelike</em>... was not in use; the dictionary mentions only one instance (apart from Aristotle).... Aristotle was using <em>kapelike</em> with an ironical overtone. Commercial trade was of course, not huckstering; nor was it retail trading; and whatever it was, it deserved to be called some form or variant of <em>emporia</em> which was the regular name for seafaring trade, together with any other form of large-scale or wholesale trade. When Aristotle referred specifically to the various kinds of maritime trade, he fell back on <em>emporia</em>, in the usual sense. Why, then, did he not do so in the main theoretical analysis of the subject but use instead a newfangled word of pejorative connotation? Aristotle enjoyed inventing words, and his humor, if any, was Shavian. The figure of the kapelos was an unfailing hit of the comic stage.... Commercial trade was no mystery. When all is said, it was but huckstering written large....</p><p><em>Chrematistike</em> was deliberately employed by Aristotle in the literal sense of providing for the necessaries of life, instead of its usual meaning of “money-making.” Laistner rendered it correctly as “the art of supply,” and Ernest Barker in his commentary recalled the original sense of <em>chremata</em>, which, he warned, was not money, but the necessaries themselves....</p><p>The signal error in rendering metadosis as "exchange" in the three crucial passages of the <em>Politics</em>and the <em>Ethics</em> cut deeper.... In an archaic society of common feasts, raiding parties, and other acts of mutual help and practical reciprocity the term <em>metadosis</em> possessed a specific operational connotation—it signified "giving a share" especially to the common pool of food, whether a religious festivity, a ceremonial meal, or other public venture was in question.... Yet we are faced with the astonishing fact that in the translation of these passages in which Aristotle insisted on the derivation of exchange from <em>metadosis</em>... they rendered <em>metadosis</em> by "exchange," and thus turned Aristotle's statement into an empty truism.... his derivation of exchange from "giving one's share"... provided a logical link between his theory of the economy in general and the practical questions at issue. Commercial trade, we recall, he regarded as an unnatural form of trade; natural trade was gainless since it merely maintained self-sufficiency.... Thus the derivation of exchange from contributing one's share to the common pool of food was the linchpin that held together a theory of the economy based on the postulate of self-sufEciency of the community and the distinction between natural and unnatural trade...</p><p>====</p><ul><li><p><strong>Note to Self</strong>: Re: Aristotle and Polanyi: Karl Polanyi thought Aristotle's economic naivete was because the commercial economy was new.

Aristotle is examining an old phenomenon from the point of view of an Athenian aristocrat. But there is much of value in Polanyi's exposition of what Aristotle says:</p><ul><li><p>Trade is "natural" when it serves the survival of the community by maintaining its self-sufficiency...</p></li><li><p>The operation of giving a share... from one's surplus.</p></li><li><p>The rate... follows from the requirement of <em>philia</em>, i.e., that the goodwill among the members persist.... The just price, then, derives from the demands of philia... [and] conform[s] to the standing of the participants in the community, thereby strenghening the goodwill on which community rests.... In such exchange no gain is involved, goods have their known prices, fixed beforehand. If exceptionally gainful retailing there must be for the sake of a convenient distribution of goods in the marketplace, let it be done by noncitizens...</p></li><li><p>Commercial trade..... How should the phenomenon be classified?...

There are, of course, other candidates. But Rome is the one I know most about, hence the one I want to focus on.</p><p>We have the Axial-Age—from -1000 to the year 1—acceleration in ideas growth: a doubling of the ideas growth rate from 0.03 to 0.06% per year—note how ludicrously low those are: 6% a century! Just enough technological progress to hold standards of living constant with a 12% increase in population and a 12% reduction in average farm size! Over a century! And at the century’s end comes the rise of the Pax Romana in the Mediterranean—and beyond, to Scotland, Roumania, Austria, Armenia. The largest empire the world had ever seen; one whose elite was interested in public works for urbanization and transport in a way not found in any previous empire, and one—most important—not solely interested in exploiting the empire for the benefit of a ruling city or a ruling cases. Don’t get me wrong: they were interested in exploiting the empire for the benefit of the senatorial and knightly classes. But they were also interested into turning people, at least people with social power, in the empire into _Romans_ So we get this mammoth expansion in trade, this mammoth expansion in investment, this simultaneous rise in population but also in standards of living in the sense of comfortable conveniences throughout the empire (and luxruies too).</p><p>And. Then. It. All. Goes. Away. Mediterranean shipping. Rhine River-valley construction. Lead atoms from smelters carried into the atmosphere and dropped onto the Greenland ice. All gone. And the Pax Romana with it. And trade. And comfort. And the rule of law. And the ability of low-class people, as citizens, to have their property and their rights protected by magistrates.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F250ab61a-e749-4009-be2f-4ea71d774a2c_1920x1080.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F250ab61a-e749-4009-be2f-4ea71d774a2c_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F250ab61a-e749-4009-be2f-4ea71d774a2c_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F250ab61a-e749-4009-be2f-4ea71d774a2c_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F250ab61a-e749-4009-be2f-4ea71d774a2c_1920x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/250ab61a-e749-4009-be2f-4ea71d774a2c_1920x1080.png" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/250ab61a-e749-4009-be2f-4ea71d774a2c_1920x1080.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Pasted Graphic 31.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Pasted Graphic 31.png&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Pasted Graphic 31.png" title="Pasted Graphic 31.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F250ab61a-e749-4009-be2f-4ea71d774a2c_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F250ab61a-e749-4009-be2f-4ea71d774a2c_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F250ab61a-e749-4009-be2f-4ea71d774a2c_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F250ab61a-e749-4009-be2f-4ea71d774a2c_1920x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>As human population grew between -6000 and 1500, and as information technologies increased with literacy and natural philosophy, somehow the greater human capability to invent did not show up in a faster pace of relative invention.

Aristotle on the Economy</strong></p><p>&lt;https://www.bradford-delong.com/2020/01/reading-notes-on-book-i-of-aristotles-politics.html&gt;</p><p><strong>Who Aristotle Was</strong></p><p>Let me remind you about Aristoteles son of Nikomakhos of Stageira. sometime tutor of Alexandros III Argeádai of Macedon, called “The Great”.</p><p>Aristotle lived from -384 to -322, in the Greek-speaking communities around the Aegean Sea. He spent most of his time in Athens. For the two millennia following his death, he would be, for a large chunk of the world, THE Philosopher: capital “P” and capital “THE”. 1650 years after his death, poet Dante Alighieri would call him “the Master… of those who know”, “il Maestro di color che sanno”. Aristotle’s was, even at so long a distance in time, the most powerful intellectual name that one could conjure with.</p><p><strong>Reading Aristotle</strong></p><p>I have assigned the beginning of Aristotle’s <em>Politics</em> &lt;<a href="https://delong.typepad.com/files/aristotle-politics-book-i.pdf">https://delong.typepad.com/files/aristotle-politics-book-i.pdf</a>&gt;.</p><p>Aristotle was a deep thinker—perhaps the deepest thinker for millennia. Aristotle was trying hard to get it right. As a result, Aristotle is the most respected intellectual landmark from his day at least up to the day of Isaac Newton. But you are going to read Aristotle, and you are going too hit a wall and think: “this is weird”—and a lot of it is weird, and even repugnant.</p><p>Yet we read him. For how could we learn if we only read people who we found not-weird? We read him as a mighty, flawed thinker whom we can learn from. And we can learn from him for two reasons:</p><p>First, his thought is mighty, therefore we should pay attention to his arguments and his conclusions.</p><p>Second, many have taken his thought—even where it is flawed—to be mighty. That fact means that his thought and its reception has a lot to tell us not just about Aristotle the intellectual and his doctrines, but about what those who received Aristotle so favorably were thinking as well.</p><p>Thus we have a lot to learn from reading Aristotle—even if often what we have to learn is not what he set out to teach.</p><p>Yet we don’t read Aristotle to learn about the economy, just as we would not read Aristotle to learn about physics, or chemistry, or astronomy. We read Aristotle to learn how intelligent ancient observers saw the economy, taking their observation both as a social fact worth study in itself, and as a window into the pre-industrial economy.</p><p><strong>The Beginning of Aristotle’s Politics</strong></p><p>Aristotle’s Politics is about how Greek men do order and ought to order and must order their households and city-states. And a Greek man to have a functional household, and for Greek men to have a functional city-state, they need resources. Politics Book I is the preliminary chapter in which Aristotle talks about those necessary resources. It contains what Aristotle believes people thinking about politics—the ordering and the right ordering by Greek men of their households and their city-states—need to know about acquiring, maintaining, and managing resources. It is thus what Aristotle has to say about what we would call the economy. That make it an excellent place to start our history of economic growth, for it sheds enormous light on the question: What was and what did smart people think of the economy in the distant past—2.5 millennia ago?</p><p>Moreover, the answer to that question ramifies, and suggests answers to related questions, like: What light can be shed on what Aristotle thought about economic growth? What were the broader intellectual currents both generated by and the result of people’s reflections on the economy of their day in which Aristotle was then swimming? What light can be shed on the structure and functioning of the economy in which Aristotle was embedded. And what can we say about its process of growth—or of not-growth?</p><p></p><h3></h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
