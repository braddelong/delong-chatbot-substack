Had it been, I’m not sure…” When Ignatieff then asks the followup—“Had the radiant tomorrow actually been created, the loss of fifteen, twenty million people might have been justified?”—Hobsbawm’s reply is “Yes”. In 2003 he expanded on this “yes”: “Let's put it this way…. The [communist] tradition… was my life.… I still think it was a great cause, the emancipation of humanity. Maybe we got onto it the wrong way, maybe we backed the wrong horse, but you have to be in that race, or else human life isn't worth living…. The idea that the only thing about this movement was that you were for the Soviet Union and that when you then discovered how awful Stalin was that you should have left is not a historic way of looking at it…” Sarah Lyall, “A Communist Life with No Apologies”, <em>New York Times</em> August 23, 2003 &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/23/books/acommunist-life-with-no-apology.html&gt;.</p><p>12) George Stigler, “The Problem of the Negro”, New Guard Vol. 5 (December 1965), pp. 11-12 &lt;https://digressionsnimpressions.typepad.com/digressionsimpressions/2020/06/stiglerracism.html&gt;.</p><p>12) Paul Volcker and Toyoo Gyohten, <em>Changing Fortunes : The World's Money and the Threat to American Leadership</em>, New York: Random House, 1992 &lt;https://archive.org/details/changingfortunes00paul/&gt;, in which Paul Volcker recounts telling Burns “with some exasperation” when Burns was Fed Chair: “Arthur… you better go home and tighten money…”.</p><p>13) Arthur Burns, “Progress Towards Economic Stability”, <em>American Economic Review</em> Vol. 50 No. 3 (March 1960), pp. 1-19 &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1813459.pdf&gt;.</p><p>14) Stuart Eizenstat, “Economists and White House Decisions”, <em>The Journal of Economic Perspectives</em> Vol. 6 No. 3 (Summer 1992), pp. 65-71 &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138302&gt;. I confess I was astonished for Eizenstat when I read this <em>from him </em>about how the Carter White House worked: “The White House needs an economic policy coordinator…. I urged Charles Schultze to move from the CEA… office… to the West Wing of the White House, to serve in the additional role of economic policy coordinator. He refused and, in retrospect, rightly so… it would compromise his objectivity and burden him with administrative duties…. But this left the President with no person without a[n agency] stake in the outcome… charged with coordinating… disparate economic advice…. The interdepartmental Economic Policy Group, chaired by the Treasury… [did] nothing more than… collect… differing agency recommendations, without adequate synthesis. The Ford administration had developed an appropriate model, which we should have employed…” </p><p>There was, in the White House, a person without an agency stake in the outcome charged with coordinating disparate domestic-policy advice: Stu Eizenstat. Eizenstat was in the White House, physically. Treasury Secretaries Blumenthal and Miller were not. If Eizenstat was overwhelmed—as he was—he should have called for more assistants, or for a peer. </p><p>15) Barrie Wigmore and Peter Temin, “The End of One Big Deflation”, Cambridge: MIT, 1988 &lt;https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/63586/endofonebigdefla00temi.pdf&gt;; Thomas Sargent, “Stopping Moderate Inflations: The Methods of Poincaré and Thatcher”, Minneapolis: Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 1981 &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/ community.28111603&gt;; Laurence Ball, “The Genesis of Inflation and the Costs of Disinflation”, <em>Journal of Money, Credit and Banking</em> Vol. 23 No. 3, Part 2: Price Stability (August 1991), pp. 439-452 &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1992678&gt;.</p><p>16) Laurence Ball, “What Determines the Sacrifice Ratio?”, in N.

And the Wall Street Journal was publishing them: John H. Cochrane, “Ending America’s Slow-Growth Tailspin: The U.S. Economy Needs a Dramatic Legal and Regulatory Simplification”, Wall Street Journal May 2, 2016 &lt;https:// www.wsj.com/articles/ending-americas-slow-growth-tailspin-1462230818&gt;. The idea was that 100% of the correlation between ordinal indices of “governance quality” and real income per capita was a causal log-linear relationship with the index as the cause that could be projected outof-sample, that the United States could easily attain best-practice in “governance quality”—an ordinal index value of 100—and then it would be straightforward to push “governance quality” up to 120 by deregulation,</p><p>27) Jeremiah 7:18</p><p>28) Max Roser et al., <em>Our World in Data</em> </p><p>29) Thomas Piketty, <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> </p><p>30) Luxemburg, <em>The Russian Revolution</em> </p><p>31) Yegor Gaidar, <em>The Soviet Collapse: Grain and Oil</em> </p><p>32) David Drake, “What Distant Deeps” February 5, 2010 &lt;http://david-drake.com/2010/what-distant-deeps/&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/incomplete-draft-long-notes-to-chapter-538?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/incomplete-draft-long-notes-to-chapter-538?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/incomplete-draft-long-notes-to-chapter-538/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/incomplete-draft-long-notes-to-chapter-538/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>(Remember: You can subscribe to this… weblog-like newsletter… here:&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>There’s a free email list.
