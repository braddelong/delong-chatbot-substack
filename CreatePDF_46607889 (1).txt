Here are early blurbs:

•  Robert Waldmann: a€oeBrad: I remember reading an earlier draft 30 years ago. You haven't wasted 
the 30 years. This book is vastly improved. It is, in my view, an amazing accomplishments!a€D

•  Fred Block: a€oeBrad: You have a distinct angle of vision, encyclopedic knowledge, and wonderful 
facility with the language. You are uniquely situated to synthesizes!. Appreciate [the booka€™ s] 
audacity and reach. a€!Let it go [to the publisher] with confidence and joya€!a€D

• Larry Summers: a€ceHistory provides the only data we have for charting a course forward in these 
turbulent times. I have not seen a more revealing and illuminating book about economics and what it 
means in a very long time. It should be required reading for anybody who cares about the future of 
the global system, and that should be everyonea€!a€D

• Thomas Piketty: SoeBrad DeLong learnedly and grippingly tells the story of how all the economic 
growth since 1870 has created a global economy that today satisfies no one's ideas of fairness. The 
long journey toward economic justice and more equal rights and opportunities for all shall and will 
continuea€!a€D

• Christie Romer: a€oeWhat a joy to finally have Brad DeLong's masterful interpretation of 
twentieth-century economic history down on paper. Slouching Towards Utopia is engaging, important, 
and awe-inspiring in its breadth and creativitya€!a€D

• Larry Summers: a€oeA book that will come out in the next several months, Brad DeLonga€™ s 
Slouching Towards Utopia is, I think, a really remarkable and powerful placing of all of economic 
history in perspective, that gives a sense that at some level I had known but never appreciated of 
how profoundly different the 20thcentury was than allother centuries and points towards the 
combined power of science and markets to change the world
profoundly, and sometimes, in some ways, for good, and sometimes, in some ways, for ill. I think 
anybody who wants to propound about economic policy should read that booka€!a€D

•  Ezra Klein: a€oel feel like Ia€™ ve been waiting for Brada€™ s big economic history opus for a 
long time now. Sol will agree that Ia€™ m very excited for that one to hit my deska€!a€D

•  Christie Romer: a€oeBrad: Reading Slouching Towards Utopia, I am struck again at what a lovely 
writer you are. I find myself just marveling at how well you express things and how alive your 
prose feels. I am having trouble putting it down (even though I need to be preparing for Econ 
2!)a€!a€D

• Tim Oa€™ReiIIy: a€oeBrad: I love it. The grand story you are looking to tell makes a lot of sense 
to me, and it is very engagingly tolda€!a€D

Elevator Pitches:

One Floor: Only when Keynes blessed the shotgun marriage of von Hayeka€™ s market and Polanyia€™ s 
society did 20th-century humanity even slouch towards utopia. Remember that, and material El 
Dorado, at least, is at hand.

Ten Floors: Before 1870, humanity lived in dire poverty, with a slow crawl of invention offset by a 
growing population. Then came a great shift: invention sprinted forward, doubling our technological 
capabilities each generation and utterly transforming the economy again and again. Our ancestors 
would have presumed we would have used such powers to build utopia. But it was not so. When 
1870A-2010 ended, the world instead saw global warming;
economic depression, uncertainty, and inequality; and broad rejection of the status quo. Economist 
Brad DeLonga€™ s Slouching Towards Utopia tells the story of how this unprecedented explosion of 
material wealth occurred, how it transformed the globea€”and why it failed to deliver us to utopia. 
Of remarkable breadth and ambition, it uncovers the last century to have been less a march of 
progress than a slouch in the right direction.

Fifty Floors: The theme of Jared Diamonda€™ s Guns, Germs, & Steell” a brilliant book, if not 
without its major flaws (and what things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major 
flaws?)a€”is: Civilizations in different places had access to different plant and animal resources, 
and for developing bio and other technologies two heads are better than one. Within Eurasia at the 
last the Atlantic Seaboard led in agricultural wealth and hence first
developed the steel and the guns. Plus Eurasians gained immunity to all the germs that jumped from 
Eurasian animals into humans. And everything else follows from those Atlantic-Seaboard differential 
advantages with respect to guns, germs, and steel.

The theme of Thomas Pikettya€™ s Capital in the 21st Centurya^'a brilliant book, if not without its 
major flaws (and what things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)a€”is: 
Capitalists control enough political levers to keep the profit rate around 5%, faster than 
economies grow. Only in exceptional eras of wars, revolutions, deep depressions, and the short 
post-WWII social-democractic age of very rapid growth will wealth at the top
fail to outpace wealth in general. Hence in normal times income and wealth inequality is either 
already very high already or is rising fast. And everything else follows from that tendency toward 
high inequality.

The theme of Brad DeLonga€™ s Slouching Towards Utopiaa^'a brilliant book, if not without its major 
flaws (and what things in this fallen sublunary sphere do not have their major flaws?)a€”is:

The long 20th centurya€”the first whose history was primarily economic, with the economy not 
painted scene-backdrop but rather revolutionizing humanity's life every single generationa€” taught 
humanity expensive lessons. In 1870 industrial research labs, modern corporations, globalization, 
and the market economy a€’’which, as that genius Friedrich von Hayek most keen-sightedly observed, 
is tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutionsa€’’proved
keys to the lock that had kept humanity in its desperately poor iron cage, with the only 
comfortable ones being the thugs with spears who took from the near-subsistence farmers, and those 
with whom they shared their extractions. And previously unimaginable economic growth revolutionized 
human life over and over, generation by generation.

We should, thereafter, have straightforwardly turned our technological power and wealth to building 
something very close to a utopia: a truly human world. From 1870-2016 was 146 years. Few in 1870 
would have doubted that humanity more than ten times richer in material terms would build ourselves 
a utopia.

So what has gone wrong? Well, that idiot Friedrich von Hayek thought the unleashed market would do 
the whole job: a€oethe market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the marketa€D. 
But, as that genius Karl Polanyi put it: people will not stand for being told that there are no 
rights but property rights. They instead insist that a€oethe market was made for man, not man for 
the marketa€D. The marketa€™ s treating those whom society saw
as equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought social explosion after explosion, blocking the 
road to utopia. They deserved communities, incomes, and stability. They needed their Polanyian 
rights to those things vindicated too.

Since 1870 humansa€’’Theodore Roosevelt, John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt, Vladimir Lenin, Margaret Thatcher, Deng Xiaoping, and othersa€” tried to think up 
solutions. They dissented from a€oethe market givetha€!a€D constructively and destructively. The 
demanded that the market do less, or different, and other institutions do more.

Only with a shotgun marriage of von Hayeka€™ s market to Polanyia€™ society, a marriage blessed by 
Keynesa€”a marriage that itself has so far failed its own sustainability testsa€”have we been able 
to even slouch towards utopia, and bring the El Dorado of a truly human world into view. Whether we 
ever justify the full bill run up over the 140 years from 1870 to 2010 will likely depend on 
whether we remember that lesson.
