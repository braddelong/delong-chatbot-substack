John P. Marquand (1937): Think Fast, Mr. Moto'. 'It had not taken Wilson Hitchings long to realize 
that the firm of Hitchings Brothers had its definite place in the commercial aristocracy of the 
East, and that China had retained a respect for mercantile tradition which had disappeared from the 
Occidental world. There were still traditions of sailing days and of the pre-treaty days in the 
transactions of the Shanghai
branch of Hitchings Brothers. The position of its office upon the Bund was enough to show it. The 
brass plate of HITCHINGS BROTHERS was polished each morning by the office coolies so that it 
glittered golden against the gray stone faA§ade. Near by were the venerable plates of JARDINE 
MATHESON and of the HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK. The plate of HITCHINGS BROTHERS had the same
remote dignity, the same integrity, the same imperviousness to timea€”which was not unnatural.

That plate had been made when a branch of Hitchings Brothers, under the control of Wilsona€™ s 
great-grandfather from Salem, had moved up to Shanghai from the factories of Canton during the 
epoch when the place was little more than a swampy China-coast fishing town. Reluctantly, but 
accurately, Wilson Hitchings could feel the venerable weight of that tradition. The involuntary 
respect which the tradition
had engendered in the narrow European world that maintained its precarious foothold in the Orient 
was accorded to Wilson Hitchings himself, in spite of youth and inexperience, simply because he 
bore the name.

Old white-suited gentlemen whom he never recalled meeting previously would suddenly slap him on the 
back as though he were an Old China Hand. Leather-faced matrons from British compounds would smile 
at him archly. Sometimes even an unknown, fat Chinese gentleman calling in the outer office would 
look at him and smile. a€oeMr. Hitchings,a€D the old gentleman would say, a€oeso nice you have come
here.a€D

a€ceGentlemen,a€D someone would say, toward evening at the bar, a€oethis is young Hitchings, just 
out from America. He doesna€™ t know me but I know him. He looks the way old Will did when he came 
out.a€! Boy, give Mr. Hitchings a drink.a€! We have to stick together these days. Anything I can 
tell you, Mr. Hitchings, simply let me know.a€D

It had not taken Wilson Hitchings long to realize that he was a public character by right of birth. 
He grew to understand that the small shopkeeper and the lowest inhabitants of the International 
Settlement all knew him and that there is no such thing as privacy in the East. Sometimes late at 
night strange, ragged rickshaw boys would speak to him, in the limpid pidgin English of the place. 
a€oeMarster Hitchings,a€D
a strange boy would shout. a€oePlease, I take you home. I know where Marster Hitchings lives ,a€C

And sometimes at the street intersections where the pedestrians and the carts and the motors went 
by in an unending ribbon, the bearded Sikh policeman would bare his white teeth in an unexpected 
smile. a€oeAll right ,a€D the man would say. a€oeAll right now, Hitchings Sahib.a€D

He had begun to realize that a part of Shanghai belonged to him, a part of that rich, monstrous, 
restive, sinful city where so many races dwelt noisily. It belonged to him because a Hitchings had 
been there ever since foreigners had come. A Hitchings had seen the city grow out of the East, 
where China, with that adaptability peculiar alone to itself, had absorbed the conveniences of the 
West and had made them into
something genial and mystic and peculiar. The firm of Hitchings Brothers, on the spot it occupied 
along the Bund, had become a part of the life. The windows of the firm, never entirely clean in 
spite of diligent washing, looked out like the eyes of cynical old men upon one of the strangest 
sights in the world.

Beside the Bund flowed the yellow treacherous currents of the Whangpoo River; warships and huge 
liners were moored in the river, the last word of Occidental ingenuity, and past them always 
drifted brown-sailed junks, almost unchanged since the oldest Chinese paintings. Sampans, propelled 
by a single sculling oar, plied their ways across the river. Scavengers, in the sampans, fought 
raucously over shipsa€™
garbage; and down on the street beneath, men stripped to the waist struggled like beasts, pulling 
burdens while limousines passed by. Out of the firm windows one could see all the comedy and 
tragedy of China struggling in a world of change, all the unbelievable inequality of wealth, 
ranging from the affluence of fortunate war-lords to a poverty reduced to a limit of existence 
which no stranger could envisage. It was
all beneath the windows, restive and fascinating, something much better accepted than studied.

Wilson Hitchings reluctantly admired his uncle for his cold acceptance of the enigmas which moved 
about them. Uncle Will Hitchings had grown to accept street riots and homicide as easily as he 
accepted his whisky-and-soda at the Club, provided dinner was properly and efficiently served as 
soon as he shouted a€oeBoy !a€D a€oeMy boy,a€D Uncle Will used to say, a€oetherea€™ s one thing for 
you to get in
your minda€”the firm of Hitchings Brothers is an honest firm. It has an excellent reputation 
upriver. Every Chinese merchant knows us. We seldom lose our customers; you must learn who these 
customers are; but dona€™ t worry much about the rest. Treat our customers politely, but dona€™ t 
mix with the natives. Ita€™ s confusing to you now. It used to be confusing to me at first, but 
youa€™ 11 get used to it.
Dona€™ t try to speak their language. You cana€™ t learn it and it will only make you queer to try. 
Ia€™ ve seen a lot of nice young fellows who have got queer trying to learn Chinese. Just remember 
our family has got along on pidgin English.

"The main thing is to be seen with the right people. I dona€™ t care how much you drink if you do 
it with the right people and in the right place; and dona€™ t worry too much about wars and 
revolutions. Everything is always upset here. All we need is to be sure we get our money, and 
therea€™ s just one thing morea€”about women. Be sure you dona€™ t marry a Russian girl. And get as 
much exercise as you
can, and remember I am broad-minded. Come to me when youa€™re in trouble, remember that nothing 
will shock mea€”nothing; and dona€™t forget you have the firm name. Ia€™ 11 see you before dinner 
at the Club.a€D

It was a strange life, an easy life, and altogether pleasant. In spite of the size of the city, the 
city was like a country club where everyone of the right sort knew everyone else, where everyone 
moved in a small busy orbit, surrounded by the unknown, and where everyone was friendly. It did not 
take him long to realize that it was a responsibility to bear the family name. a€oeYou see,a€D his 
uncle told him, a€oewe are
one of the oldest firms in China and age and name mean a great deal here. I want you to come to 
dinner to-night. My new cook is very good. I want you to change your cook, he is squeezing you too 
much. I want you to be sure to be at the Club every afternoon, and I want you to use my tailor. His 
father and his grandfather have always dressed the Hitchingses.a€D

father and his grandfather have always dressed the Hitchingses.a€D

a€oeDo you think there is going to be trouble up North, sir?a€D Wilson Hitchings asked.

His Uncle Will looked at him urbanely. His broad, red face reminded Wilson of the setting sun. 
a€oeThere is always trouble up North,a€D Uncle William said. a€oel want you to get yourself a new 
mess-jacket. The one you wore last night didna€™t fit, and thata€™ s more important than political 
speculation. You had better go to your desk now. I shall have to read the mail. Well, what is it?a€D
The man who sat in front of the door of William Hitchingsa€™ private officea€”a gray-haired Chinese 
in a gray cotton gowna€’’entered. a€oePlease, sir,a€D he said, a€oea Japanese gentleman to see 
youa€”the one who came yesterday.a€D

Uncle Williama€™ s face grew redder. a€oeMy boy,a€D he said to Wilson, a€oethese Japanese are 
always making trouble lately. Theya€™re underselling us all along the line. You may as well sit and 
listen. How long have you been here now?a€D
a€oeSix months, sir,a€D Wilson Hitchings said.

a€ceWell,a€D his uncle said, a€oewe have important interests in Japan. You had better begin to get 
used to the Japanese. Yes, sit here and listen.a€D He waved a heavy hand to the office attendant. 
a€oeShow the man in,a€D he said.

Red-faced, white-haired, and growing heavy, William Hitchings sat behind his mahogany table with 
the propeller-like blades of the electric fan on the ceiling turning lazily above his head. Short 
as the time had been since he had been sent to China, Wilson could understand that much of his 
unclea€™ s attitude was a faA§ade behindwhich he concealed a shrewd and accurateknowledge. Hesat 
therelooking about
his room with a heavy placid stupidity which Wilson could suspect was part of his unclea€™ s stock 
in trade. Even his bland assumption of ignorance of Chinese was valuable.

His uncle had once admitted, perhaps rightly, that it all gave a sense of confidence, a sense of 
old-fashioned stability. It had been a long while since the firm had started dealing in cargoes of 
assorted merchandise; and now its business, largely banking, was varied and extensive.The firm was 
preparedto sell anything up-country through native merchants who had been connected with it for 
generations,and the firm
was the private banker for many important individuals. Wilson could guess that his uncle knew a 
great deal about the finances and the intrigues of the Nanking Government, although his 
conversation was mostly of bridge and dinner.

While they waited Uncle William began opening the pile of letters before him with a green jade 
paper-cutter. Once he glanced at the clock then at the door and then at his nephew. It was three in 
the afternoon. a€oeMy boy,a€D said Uncle William, a€oel want you to listen to this conversation 
carefully and I want you to tell me what you think of it afterwards. I want you to consider one 
thing which is very important.

You must learn to cultivate a cheerful poker face. That is what you are here for, and it will take 
you years before you can do it.a€D
a€oeYou have one, sir,a€D said Wilson.

a€oeYes, my boy,a€D said Uncle William, a€oel rather think I have.a€D He laid down his paper-cutter 
and raised his voice a trifle. There were footsteps outside the office door. Uncle William looked 
at the wall opposite him, which was adorned with an oil painting of the first Hitchings factory at 
Canton, beside which was a Chinese portrait of a stout gentleman in a purple robe seated with a 
thin hand resting on
either knee. It was the portrait of old Wei Qua, the first hong merchant with whom the Hitchingses 
had dealt. Wei Quaa€™ s face was enigmatic, untroubled and serene.

a€oeNow in the races to-morrow,a€D Uncle William said distinctly, a€oel like Resolution in the 
third. There are going to be long odds on him to-morrow and he is always good in mud. Yes, I think 
I shall play Re solution.a€D The office door was opening and Uncle William pushed back his chair. A 
Japanese was entering, walking across the room in front of the corpulent Chinese clerk with swift 
birdlike steps.
a€oeMr. Moto, if you please,a€D the Chinese clerk was saying.

Mr. Moto was a small man, delicate, almost fragile. His patent leather shoes squeaked slightly as 
he walked. He was dressed formally in a morning coat and striped trousers. His black hair was 
carefully brushed in the Prussian style. He was smiling, showing a row of shiny gold-filled teeth, 
and as he smiled he drew in his breath with a polite, soft sibilant sound. a€oelt is so kind of you 
to receive me,a€D he said.
a€oeSo very, very kind, since I sent my letter such a short time ago. Thank you very, very much.a€D

aCceThe pleasure is all mine,a€D Uncle William said. a€oeThank you, Mr. Motoa€D...
