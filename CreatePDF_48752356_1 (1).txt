First: Question: Have Harald Uhlig & Company Read Lisa Cooka€™s Paper at All? Answer: No

Only somebody who has not read the paper, and does not care that they have not read the paper, 
would say so.

So last Wednesday I was peacefully working away, reached the end of one task, filed it away, 
decided to check to see if any emails I needed to deal with had come in over the past eight hours, 
and found:

Chris Brunet <chrisbrunet@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.org>: I saw you signed this letter: 
<https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/NEA%20support%20statement%20signatories%20in%20columns
ril.pdf>. I am trying to find one person among the 500 of you who is brave enough to respond to 
this blog post: 
<https://haralduhlig.blogspot.com/2022/02/lisa-cook-has-been-nominated-to-federal.html>
More specifically, I am looking for a comment on whether or not you think Cook's signature 
publication, "Violence and economic activity: evidence from African-American patents, 1870-1940", 
is fatally flawed as Uhlig suggests. Do you agree with Uhlig's assessment of this paper? Is this 
paper fatally flawed? Why or why not? You have 24 hours to respond.

So I wrote back, immediately: Ia€™ ve engaged with Harald before, and found it a waste of time. 
Hea€™ s not a data persona€! When Lisa came to Berkeley to present this, we gave her a hard time on 
the data point, and she convinced us that it was a real discontinuity in patenting, and not simply 
a failure to identify patents by Blacks. People who had been patenting in the 1890s, and ought to 
have been patenting in the 1900s, weren't, IIRC...

Chris Brunet: Huh. When I hear that people who had been patenting in the 1890s, and ought to have 
been patenting in the 1900s, weren't, My first instinct is to think "they must have stopped 
harvesting data on those people", not, "Oh, those people must have become less innovative and 
stopped wanting to patent"

So I wrote back again: Her problem was not in finding patents patents are indexed by name Dash a€” 
figuring out which names are those of African-American inventors. Once you find an inventor, you 
can track his patents throughout his career whether or not they ended up in Bakera€™ s sample. That 
said, my view was it is that some of the circa1900decline is very likelyto be a coverage issue. But 
data work is very hard, andsniping at data imperfections is very easy.
My rule-of-thumb has always been that it is those people who put in the work to try to make better 
data have standing to criticize past efforts at data work a€” thus Christina Romer got her standing 
to criticize Stan Lebergott. That rule of thumb has kept me from wasting a lot of time.

You know, if someone were brought to you, and you were told that they had been deputy team lead for 
financial regulation and such issues during a presidential transition, had been the point staff 
economist for the White House on the Eurozone dimension of the 2008 to 2012 financial crisis, had 
been a special advisor to the secretaryof the treasuryon finance anddevelopment, and had beena 
Hoover Institution National Fellow, your reaction would not have been a€oethis is
an unqualified person put forward to advance some sinister non-technocratic agendaa€D, let alone 
someone put forward because she strokes the a€oeerogenous zones of progressivesa€D.

I confess I did not think we would get to calling Lisa Cook a whore in the first week of this.

Chris Brunet: I admit I had never heard of George Will before, since I am Canadian, and can only 
keep track of so many pundits. I have no strong opinions on his "erogenous zones" analogy.

At this point, I decided that I had spent enough time wading in this particular pool of 
mucka€’’somebody who claims to have never heard of George F. Will and to have no opinion about 
whether one should or should nota€”genteely, for George F. Will learned at Bill Buckleya€™ s knee 
how to do this, so that he can pretend that was not what he meant, while leaving no real doubt in 
anyonea€™ s mind that that was what he meanta€”call a Black woman a whore is just not
worth engaging.

But I did file this away, thinking that I really should reread Lisa Cook (2014) 
<http://econ.msu.edu/papers/cook/Violence%20and%20Economic%20Activity.pdf>, and last night I did 
so:

1. I had failed to bring to mind that her responses to the data questions were not just that 
a€oethere is a break not just in the aggregate series but in individual inventorsa€™ patenting 
patterns around 1900a€D, but that also there was a broader sharp fall in entrepreneurial activity 
by African-Americans: newspapers, for example. After checking, other people at the seminar I saw 
say that they thought this figure did the most in putting to rest fears that all of the
ca.-1900 decline was a data artifact. If it is all a data artifact, it is a very broad one:

appendix

2. I had failed to bring to mind that her firsta€”her very firsta€”set of regression results, in 
Table 6, dummies out the pre-1900 dataa€”the computer is looking for patterns in the 20th century 
and patterns in the 19th century, and is paying no attention to the sharp drop at the century 
boundary:

and economic activity, the Miron-Romer Industrial Production Index (log), are included in each 
model. The
sample period is 1882-1940. See data appendix for variable descriptions. Coefficients marked with

3. Her second, panel, set of regression results in Table 7 does, for the most part, use the 
ca.-1900 decline as part of its identifying variance. But column 6, which looks only at the 
1918-1940 sample, does not. It looks as though the computer does take the time-series dimension of 
the absence of riots and the boom in inventive activity from 1880-1895 as its signal that white 
violence in the form of race-riots is substantially correlated with low patenting, but even in
the post-WWI sample there is plenty of cross-sectional state identifying variation for the computer 
to judge that places where there are a lot of lynchings are places where it is very unhealthy to be 
a Black inventor as well:

Ezra Klein: Can Democrats See Whata€™ s Coming?: a€~Picking winners and losers means picking some 
losers. Venture capitalists can brag about their failures, but bureaucrats are flayed for them. 
That the Obama administration funded Solyndra is canon. That the same program threw a lifeline to a 
struggling electric car manufacturer named Tesla is trivia. Democrats have run scared from 
accusations of big government for decades, and so they continue to try to show
that they will leave the market to its magic, the scientists to their beakers, and confine 
government to cushioning the blows or looking after the childrena€!. Bidena€! promised a 
a€oewartime efforta€D to fight Covid, but thata€™ s not what wea€™ ve seena€l. But if Democrats 
dona€™ t always admit how much government can do to help, they also dona€™ t always admit how much 
it can do to hurt. The market would build more housing if local zoning czars would let
them. Companies were clamoring to sell more rapid tests earlier, but the F.D.A. wouldna€™ t let 
them. All across the country, nuclear and solar and wind projects are being tied up in red tapea€!. 
If Democrats want to claim a bigger role for government in shaping our future, they need to be the 
ones who are most outraged when it is government that is holding us backa€!
