Those are very nice words to hear.</p><p>I was, not, however, arrogant enough to put anything like this in the book:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Thoukydides the Athenian</strong>: <em>The Peloponnesian War:</em> ‘The absence of the fabulous in my history will, I fear, detract somewhat from its interest; but if it be judged useful by those inquirers who desire an exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation of the future, which in the course of human things must resemble if it does not reflect it, I shall be content. In sum, I have written my work, not as a careerist ticket-punch or as a performance to win applause in the moment, but as a treasure for all time…</p><p>καὶ ἐς μὲν ἀκρόασιν ἴσως τὸ μὴ μυθῶδες αὐτῶν ἀτερπέστερον φανεῖται: ὅσοι δὲ βουλήσονται τῶν τε γενομένων τὸ σαφὲς σκοπεῖν καὶ τῶν μελλόντων ποτὲ αὖθις κατὰ τὸ ἀνθρώπινον τοιούτων καὶ παραπλησίων ἔσεσθαι, ὠφέλιμα κρίνειν αὐτὰ ἀρκούντως ἕξει. κτῆμά τε ἐς αἰεὶ μᾶλλον ἢ ἀγώνισμα ἐς τὸ παραχρῆμα ἀκούειν ξύγκειται…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D22%3Asection%3D4">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D22%3Asection%3D4</a>&gt; I.22.4</p></blockquote><p>Cf.: <strong>Hunter Rawlings:</strong> <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26543677">Ktema te es Aiei...

What went wrong?…</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>The one thing disappointing to me in Tim Noah's review is that he does seem to have missed the forest. He wants to claim that the 20th century really came to an end in 1980 with the Neoliberal Turn and the rise of the Neoliberal Order, as that was when, as Eric Hobsbawm put it in his 1977 lecture, “The Forward March of Labour Halted”. But a forward march toward greater equality and greater prosperity is profoundly not the story of the 20th century, at least not of <em><strong>my</strong></em> 20th century.</p><p>It is quite disturbing to me and someone is smart and as careful or reader as Tim Noah had this reaction, especially because I tried to take great pains to hit people over the head with the grand narrative—as Tim notes, sixteen variations in the text on “the market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the market”.</p><p>So let me try again:</p><ul><li><p>In 1870 technological progress achieves critical mass</p></li><li><p>Thereafter human technological prowess doubles every generation</p></li><li><p>That means a truly human world—one that solves the problem of baking a sufficiently large economic pie, after which the problems of slicing and tasting it—equitably distributing and properly utilizing our wealth—should be easy to deal with</p></li><li><p>Technological advance, however, is Schumpeterian creative destruction</p></li><li><p>Immense wealth creation, coupled with the destruction of industries, occupations, livelihoods, and communities. Every generation. And then it happens again.</p></li><li><p>The forces-of-production underlying hardware is being replaced every generation.</p></li><li><p>Thus the economic-sociological software—the rough running code of society—needs to be rewritten on the fly every generation.</p></li><li><p>Cobbled-together so that it will not crash, for whatever worked well a generation ago will not work well, or not work at all, today.</p></li><li><p>This rewriting takes place in tension between von Hayek and Polanyi</p></li><li><p>Von Hayek: the market can give us wealth but not fairness or justice. But reaching for fairness and justice will destroy the wealth-creation and put us on the Road to Serfdom: “the market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the market” is the best we can do.</p></li><li><p>Polanyi: the market says the only rights that matter are property rights, but people think they have and demand other rights: comfortable communities, economic stability, the proper allocation of incomes to the deserving. Tell people the only real rights are property rights and they will revolt, and the system will crash.</p></li><li><p>Polanyi: government must recognize and accomodate the fact that “the market was made for man, not man for the market”.</p></li><li><p>It is this unresolvable tension in how to rewrite the software economic-sociological code every generation on the fly that has caused the problems of slicing and tasting the economic pie—of equitably distributing it so that everyone has <em><strong>enough</strong></em>, and of using our technological powers to enable us all to live our lives wisely and well—have flummoxed and continue to flummox us.</p></li></ul><p>It is this process that runs history from 1870-2010. And this form of history is the one that comes to an end in 2010, with the exhaustion of the final attempt to find a satisfactory solution, with the exhaustion of  the Neoliberal Order as the way to manage the constant rewrite of economic and sociological patterns and institutions—with no alternative (yet) in sight and with attention shifting to the 21st century issues of global warming, nuclear proliferation, and authoritarian challenge.</p><p>Yet more evidence that the book I think I wrote is not the book people read. And so I resolve to figure out how to do better in the future at conveying my Grand Narrative message to structure the webs of knowledge people create in their own minds as they read my books…</p><p

It has been produced and improved by collaboration: the work of talented, largely anonymous groups, generation after generation, rather than identifiable individuals. And it is less verbal than embodied. Most of the experiments involved in forming a craft and the practices used to teach and further develop it go unrecorded, as do those who carried them out…. Teaching in the world of things is often physical: the teacher urges pupils to apply all of their senses and employs gestures as well as words to make clear how one wields a tool or decides if something has finished cooking…. No notes preserve those lessons. How can we hope to discover how a medieval blacksmith learned to forge tools or a Renaissance tailor learned to cut brocade? Embodied knowledge is—or was, in an age before prefabrication had taken command—incredibly varied…. Expertise that had to be acquired by touch and hearing, smell and sight. This sort of learning is gained by handling objects. It means training one’s hands to do many basic things precisely, quickly, and automatically—leaving the mind free to concentrate on the most complex parts of the task.</p><div class="install-substack-app-embed"><img class="install-substack-app-embed-img" src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba551d-e14f-46ac-be61-6405108df1c2_1189x1189.png"><div class="install-substack-app-embed-text"><div class="install-substack-app-header">Read Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality in the Substack app</div><div class="install-substack-app-text">Available for iOS and Android</div></div><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_context=author-post-insert" target="_blank" class="install-substack-app-embed-link"><button class="install-substack-app-embed-btn button primary">Get the app</button></a></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donate Subscriptions&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true"><span>Donate Subscriptions</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
