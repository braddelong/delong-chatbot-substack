First: A Great Labor Report!

FRED • Total Nonfarm Private Payroll Employment


I still do not understand why the Federal Reserve is not extraordinarily gleeful about the recovery 
that it (plus the Biden administration, plus the Democratic congressional caucuses) have managed.

When have we ever seen such rapid recoveries in the labor-force? No, we are not back to pre-plague 
levels. But we are certainly getting there. And a full recovery is certainly attainable: we could 
have another 7 million jobs over the next two years, if we are lucky and skillful:

Ellen loanes: Understand the News'. a€~The labor market added 678,000 jobs in February, driving the 
unemployment rate down to 3.8 percent from 4 percent in January, the lowest level since the start 
of the pandemica€!. The strong employment numbers are a good sign for the labor market and reflect 
a rebound from the latest wave of Covida€“19 infections due to the omicron variant a€” and 
post-pandemic recovery overall. But
employment is not yet back to pre-pandemic levels, and many people need to negotiate child care and 
health concerns. The employment boom isna€™t hitting everyone equally; the unemployment rate for 
Black women rose from 5.8 percent to 6.1 percent in February from the previous month. Their 
participation in the workforce also decreased by .2 percentage points last month. Nevertheless, the 
positive jobs numbers are part of the
calculus that goes into the Federal Reservea€™ s decision to raise interest rates in an effort to 
combat inflationa€!. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that a€cehindsight says we should have 
moved earliera€D on rate increasesa€!

LINK: chttps ://www.vox .com/>

And let me disagree with Powell: I see no reason why the Fed should have a€oemoved earliera€D on 
rate increases. Bond-market expectations of medium- and long-term inflation are still 
extraordinarily well-anchored. And one of the major benefits of maintaining the anchor is that then 
it gives you policy flexibility to do whatever is optimal in the short run to attain maximum 
feasible employment and productivity growth.

That means that the Federal Reservea€™ s task is to craft a path for interest rates and for the 
short-term inflation rate that gets the economy to the place where a well-functioning frictionless 
flex-price macroeconomy would go if it could. We cannot have a frictionless flex-price 
macroeconomy. We have sticky prices. We have, for very powerful human psychological reasons, 
downward-sticky wages. We have sticky debts. (In the context of sticky debts, the
standard 20th-century austerian belief that a business-cycle free macroeconomy could be attained in 
a straightforward way by a war to destroy labor unions appears more than usually silly.) The fact 
that we are repeatedly kissing up to and sticking to the zero-lower bound means that the nominal 
interest-rate degree-of=freedom is simply not enough to do the job.

Plus we do need for relative prices to move to provide the incentives for the structural sectoral 
adjustment that we need to undertake.

So why, again, should the Fed have moved earlier to hike interest rates? If medium- and long-term 
inflation expectations were on the move, I would get the point. But where is the evidence that they 
are?

Paragraphs:

Noah Smith: I Can Only Promise You that Ita€™ s Going to Get Weirder: S~ Artificial wombs would 
significantly reduce the physical strain that pregnancy places on womenS™ s bodiesS!. We relegate 
the gory details to the realm of parenting classes and raunchy comedy. But itS™ s absolutely real. 
WeS™ ve eliminated many of our burdens through the magic of technology S’’carrying water all day, 
washing laundry by hand in the river, chopping
firewood to heat our homesS”but pregnancy remains. Unless youS™re rich, of course. My wealthy 
friend, whose first pregnancy required a hysterectomy due to placenta accreta, will have her second 
child via a surrogate, using pre-frozen embryos. This costs upwards of $100,000, which is 
approximately equal to the entire median wealth of an American household. Who would begrudge my 
friend this? And even if she were able to bear a second child

herself, who would begrudge her the opportunity to outsource it? Artificial wombs are simply a way 
to take a privilege for the upper class, and make it possible for other classes of society to enjoy 
it as well. And this is how itS™ 11 almost certainly be received. Angry Twitter people always seem 
to envision new technologies as something that government imposes on the populace, possibly at the 
behest of mad billionaires. In the real world, what usually happens
is that people simply adopt a new technology because they realize it makes life easier for themS!

John Stoehr: The Real Americans Versus The a€~Real Americansd€™: S~For the followers of the former 
president, and for the GOP leaders paving the way for his return, freedom is about power. ItS™ s 
about what they can do to you without consequence and what you canS™ t do to them without 
consequence. The social contract is tyranny. They owe nothing to you. You, however, owe everything 
to them. They call themselves the Scereal

Americans.SD For everyone else, freedom is democracy and self-government. That requires respect for 
social contract, which itself requires respect for the truth, as the truth is independent from 
human agency. The truth not only binds equal citizens but enables compromise between them. At root 
is the recognition that the common interest and common good are achievable through shared purpose 
and sacrifice. We are all in this together. Only when we honor
that can we all of us be truly free. In my view, these are the real AmericansS!

Jordan Schneider & Chris Miller: What Happens to China Now That Autocrats Are Bad News?: S~Jordan 
Schneider: See After Crimea [Russian foreign minister] Sergei Lavrov had this enormous shit-eating 
grin on his face. I donS™ t have the words for the contrast between this and what we saw at the 
Security Council meeting. They looked like they were staring death in the faceS!. What happened [on 
Sunday]. There was a lot of weirdness and not
particularly coordinated messaging. What gives?SD Chris Miller: Seel think the Security Council 
meeting is the greatest puzzle of what weS™ ve seen over the past couple of weeks. Although it was 
publicly described as a live broadcast, if you zoom in on the watches in the meeting, it was 
prerecordedS!. Every key member of the Russian political eliteS! every single one of them seemed a 
little bit uncertain about where things were goingS!. The
technocrats   and the governmental seeming very nervous and unsurea€!. Putin laughed twice at 
[Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service] Sergei Naryshkin. It was almost as though the 
Kremlin wanted to show that the elite was being whipped into shape. But Ia€™m surprised that Putin 
felt like the elite had to be whipped into shapea€!.a€D Jordan Schneider: a€oelta€™ s a weird 
dynamic when this is your team who youa€™ ve had 20 years to pick.
Youa€™re about to go to war alongside them and then you dress them down in public and then you 
record it and then five hours or however long later you have the whole world watching, ita€™ s just 
an odd series of events.a€D Chris Miller: "Before this week wea€™ d been talking a little bit about 
Putin becoming more isolated during the pandemica€! a very rigid regime of quarantined!. The 
pandemic does seem to have affected him on a personal level
and   cut off his access to information. I think this has impacted him in a way that we didna€™t 
fully understands!. I cana€™t wait for Sergei Lavrova€™ s memoirs. But I hope theya€™re written 
from The Haguea€!

Subject: Big-Books Seminar on Economic Growth?

Well, it looks like I may be teaching a small undergraduate coursea€”a big-books seminar on 
economic growth in perspective this fall.
Is this the right way to organize it? And are these the right things to read?

Economic Growth: Seminar

Description

This seminar course will analyze how scholars think about modern economic growth and how people 
thought about the idea of economics growth before the onset of modern economic growth in the 19th 
century. Students will read major works by scholars trying to understand economic growth from 
different perspectives and discuss what these scholars got right and what they got wrong.

For it is very much the case that there ia a new thing under the sun since 1870: economic growth at 
the pace we are used toa€”roughly 2% per yeara€”with associated creative-destruction 
revolutionizing the economy every generation per generation and then rerevolutionizing it again. 
How have people thought about this process? And how did people think about the idea of economic 
growth before we had it?
