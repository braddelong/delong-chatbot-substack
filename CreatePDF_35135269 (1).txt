Key Insights:

Brad DeLong: a€~Fifteen years ago solar power was going to be burning switchgrass in a closed 
carbon cyclea€!. We thought that Nikola Tesla had won the battle of the systems against Thomas 
Edison because battery technology is poisonous, corrosive, and incredibly difficulta€”as opposed to 
Tesla winning the battle of the system, simply because he was an absolute amazing genius who could 
make electrons get up and dance in high-power alternating
current in ways that should not have been possible. Now we know bettera€la€™

Zeke Hausfather: a€~Technology is the sauce: 15 years ago we were talking as if it was this giant 
trade-off between the economy and and the environmental hat was baked into these climate 
economicsa€! the entire assumption^ I. In 2009 solar was $350 a megawatt-houra€l. The price of 
solar has fallen 10 fold. The price of wind has fallen threefold, the price of batteries has fallen 
tenfold. Do not underestimate the extent to which technology enablesa€!. It's
possible to be increasingly optimistic about climate change and to recognize that we still have a 
huge way to goa€! even if we have started taking the worst possible outcomes off the tablea€l. We 
shouldn't give up hopea€!a€™

Brad DeLong: a€~The American century is over. The United States has broken so many promises over 
the past four years. No fraction of the Republican party will commit to being a€oeglobalista€n ever 
again. Global political leadership will have to come from the arc of Asia from China through to 
Pakistana€”the six great river valleys of Asia plus the monsoon regions with all their subsistence 
farmers who are in the frontline and will be taking the bullets of
damage from global warming as they need the right amount of water at the right time to live, The 
minds of these Asian governments will be concentrated over the next 60 years. And when they say 
a€oebark a€oe J think the rest of the world will have no choice but to go a€ceARF!a€n

Noah Smith: a€~Everything's downstream from technology. Technology determines the possibilities of 
politics, the trade-off functions of economicsa€”all the entire terms of debate. And that 
technology does not fall from the sky. We live not in Ed Prescott world but Paul Romer world, where 
technology is something that we choose to make. We do not think enough about purposeful making of 
technologies that changes the game and our constraintsa€!a€™

On the Front Lines & Likely to Take the Bullets:

The 2 billion of the global poor who currently live in the six great river valleys plus the monsoon 
lands of Asia are (a) among those most at risk from global warming, and (b) the object of concern 
from statesa€’’China and Indiaa€’’highly likely to be global superpowers and thus in positions to 
act come mid-century.

Drone strikes on the coal-fired power plants of countries that do not play ball with China and 
India? They have every incentive to try to keep the monsoons in the right place at the right time 
with the right amount of watera€”plus trying to keep enough but not too much and not too irregular 
water flows through the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow Rivers:
