Suppose I start with:</p><blockquote><h2><strong>Ensorcelled by the Devil of Malthus: </strong></h2><h3><strong>World Economic History, -6000 to 1870</strong></h3><h4>Brad DeLong</h4><p>2022-10-20 Th</p><p></p><p>Between 1848 and 1873 John Stuart Mill published the successive additions of his <em>Principles of Political Economy, with Some of Their Applications to Social Philosophy</em>. In each edition of the book he included the following passage:</p><p>‚ÄúHitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of any human being. They have enabled a greater population to live the same life of drudgery and imprisonment, and an increased number of manufacturers and others to make fortunes. They have increased the comforts of the middle classes. But they have not yet begun to effect‚Ä¶ great changes in human destiny‚Ä¶ &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.36903">https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.36903</a>&gt;‚Äù</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1873 was not that long ago. For somebody like my son, born in 1990, it was the date of birth of his great-great grandparents. From 1870 to today is five generations. From -6000 to 1870 is 260 generations. Moreover, there was about as much proportional technological progress from -6000 to 1870 as there has been from 1870 to today. Yet between -6000 and 1870 typical human standards of living increased by perhaps 40%. By contrast between 1870 and today humanity‚Äôs collective standard of living has grown ten-fold‚Äîand the typical standard of living more than 5-fold. For from -6000 to 1870 human population grew from 5 to 1300 million‚Äî260-fold. Since 1870 human population has grown from 1.3 to 7.6 billion‚Äîsix-fold.</p><p>That population growth is the answer to the question of why humanity‚Äôs productivity and standard of living has risen so much since 1870, while it rose so little before. Before 1870, that greater population puts more pressure on resources caused nearly all of pre-1870 technological progress to be eaten up by the need to compensate for the smaller farm sizes and poorer near-surface ores available to the average member of the growing population. Before 1870, technology lost its race with fertility. After 1870, it won it.</p><p>Thus the first questions about the pre-1870 economy present themselves: Why was technological progress so slow before 1870. And why was population growth so relatively fast, by the yardstick of the contemporaneous rate of technological improvement, over the nearly 8 millennia between -6018 70? Why, and how? Put a pin in those questions: we will return to them later.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>That technology lost its race with fertility over -6000 to 1870 profoundly shaped all of human history not only up to 1870, but since. Technology‚Äôs loss of its race against fertility meant that the pre-1870 world was one of dire poverty: there was absolutely no chance, back then, for humanity to be productive enough to bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to have <em><strong>enough</strong></em>. People, however, still desperately wanted <em><strong>enough</strong></em> for themselves and their families. What to do? Since you could not produce with high enough productivity, you chose‚Äîif you could‚Äîthe alternative: to take. You established yourself as part of the elite, √©lbowed competitors for membership out of the way, dominated, and took: history was then a coalition of thugs-with-spears plus their accountants, bureaucrats, and propagandists. They lived the (relatively) good life that we remember as the high civilizations of the past. The strong did what they wished, while the weak suffered what they must‚Ä¶</p></blockquote><p>And then I ask the AI at &lt;<a href="http://lex.page">http://lex.page</a>&gt; to continue. It comes up with:</p><blockquote><p>Ancient Rome was such an elite. So too were ancient Greece, China, and India. Further back in time, other elites‚Äîthe priests, nobles, and kings of the first civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley‚Äîlived large on the sweat and toil of the common people. And the common people were kept in their place‚Äîand in poverty‚Äîby the force of the elites‚Äô arms.</p><p>But the elites were not always successful in their efforts.

Inequality we see in developmental outcomes is the result of the inequality of parents‚Äô ability to build the necessary skills children need.... It‚Äôs society‚Äôs fault for putting so responsibility on parents to be experts in areas that some adults spend decades in educational settings to become experts. His proposal is that we spend at least as much on children as we do on the elderly‚Ä¶ to, as the book title says, stop overloading our parents‚Ä¶ As a developmental psychologist, I agree most strongly with Hilger‚Äôs view that children need far more skilled support especially in the first five years of development prior to formal education. Many behavior genetic proponents, in my view, seem to forget about the immense brain development that occurs in the first few years of life, years in which too many children develop in underestimating environments that inhibit the reaching of their full potential.

Gorbachev understood that the Soviet Union could not keep up with the US militarily while satisfying civilian demands for higher living standards. But while he <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Soviet-Union/The-Brezhnev-era">rejected</a> the Brezhnev era‚Äôs stagnation-inducing policies, he had nothing coherent to put in their place. Instead of facilitating a functioning market economy, his rushed abandonment of the central-planning system <a href="https://theanalysis.news/gorbachev-paved-way-for-oligarchs-aleksandr-buzgalin/">enriched</a> the corrupt managerial class in the Soviet republics and led to a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26925339">resurgence</a> of ethnic nationalism.
