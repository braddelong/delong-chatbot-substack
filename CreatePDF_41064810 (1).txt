masking is a€cecloth/surgicala€D a€“ https://t.co/SIxqBzvSOd 2/ cloth/surgical both pretty weak, & 
thus 2xa€™ing could make sense *if* N95s not available, & cloth-over-surgical has been studied as 
better than either cloth or surgical alone, BUTa€!

A Deeper Dive into Semiconductor Foundries

TL;DR In last weeka€™ s issue, we learned about the core machines that populate a semiconductor 
foundry. In this weeka€™ s issue, we will dive deeper into the construction of a foundry and learn 
about the actual physical edifice itself. Semiconductor foundries are large factories that place 
considerable burden on the surrounding community and infrastructure. Wa€!

Jeet Heer: Civil War Games: a€~Michael Antona€! now speculating on the possibility of a new Civil 
Wara€! California and Texasa€!. a€oelf the Lone Star way of life is to survive, Texans must fight 
for it. Then we shall see whether Californiaa€™ s long experiment with postmodern deracination and 
anti-masculinity can stand up to Texasa€™ s more robust embrace of the old virtues. Ia€™ m
not a betting man, but were that conflict to erupt, my money would be on Texas.a€Da€! In Texas, Joe 
Biden got 46 per cent of the vote as against 52 per cent for Trump. Thata€™ s hardly a state in a 
position to unify and attack California. The civil strife America has to worry about is persistent 
terrorism from so-called a€oelone wolvesa€D radicalized by the extremist ideology that the Antons
of the world promote. The return of conflicts modeled on the massed armies of the 19th century is 
virtually impossiblea€!. The term a€cederacinationa€D should set off alarm bellsa€!. Ina€! The 
Battle Cry of Freedom (1988)a€! James McPherson delineated this thinkinga€!. a€oeSoutherners 
invented a genealogy that portrayed Yankees as descendants of the medieval Anglo-Saxons and
southerners as descendants of their Norman conquerorsa€!. Puritans who settled New England anda€! 
Cavaliers who colonized Virginiaa€! If matters came to a fight, therefore, one Norman southerner 
could doubtless lick ten of those menial Saxon Yankees ,a€D These ideasa€! did not fare wella€!

Economist: What Tech Does China Want?'. a€~The vision is becoming clear. In a decade or so China 
will, if the Communist Party has its way, become a techno-utopia with Chinese characteristics, 
replete with a€oedeep techa€D such as cloud-computing, artificial intelligence (ai), self-driving 
cars and home-made cutting-edge chips. Incumbent technology giants such as Alibaba in e-commerce
or Tencent in payments and entertainment will be around but less overweeninga€”and less lucrative. 
Policies to curb their market power will redistribute some of their profits to smaller merchants 
and app developers, and to their workers. Second-tier cities will boast their own tech industries 
with localised services, competing with the less-mighty titans. Data will pulse through the system,
available to firms of all sizes, under the watchful eye of the government in Beijing. Chinaa€™ s 
internet will strengthen its authoritarian design. Clearer, too, is the way in which President Xi 
Jinping wants to make this vision a reality. Besides talking up deep tech, this involves taking the 
shallower sort down a pega€!. Many politicians in America and Europe would love to fashion their 
tech
industry into something like Mr Xia€™ s vision: less social media and other a€oespiritual opiuma€D, 
as Chinese state news outlets recently dubbed video-gaming; more strategic development of the 
techno-infrastructure of the 21st century. This includes computer chips, clean energy and much 
besidesa€!. The policies behind the techlash are born of sweeping goals for society from the highest
reaches of central government, an echelon of engineers and economists who lack expertise in most of 
the sectors being targeteda€!. Apparently without irony, Chinese media have likened the 
governmental™ s push to spur domestic chipmaking to the Great Leap Forwarda€!

Douglas London: Afghanistan Not An Intelligence Failurea€” Something Much Worse'. a€~In grading 
their own homework, the U.S. defense establishment only exacerbated the problem. While ita€™ s 
little surprise the Department of Defense was unwilling to objectively evaluate the resolve and 
capacity of those they trained, equipped, and advised to resist a forthcoming Taliban offensive,
their rose-colored depictions of achievement over 20 years flew in the face of reality, and was 
consistently challenged by the CIAa€™ s more gloomy, albeit realistic projectionsa€!
