In short, I never got around to it. But last week I noticed the book on my shelves again. So here we are:</p><p>Looking back on this, this turned out to be crankier than I wanted it to be. That is a result of my instinctive reaction to <em><strong>philosophy</strong></em>. Philosophy is really hard! If philosophers could make with conviction arguments that were convincing—well, those philosophers who have had that success with their philosophy have by that token become something other than philosophers, and their philosophy has become some other discipline.</p><p>First, although it is a good book, it is not a great book. I don’t see it as Ezra Klein does—“a book that will change your sense of how grand the sweep of human history could be, where you fit into it, and how much you could do to change it for the better. It's as simple, and as ambitious, as that”—because it tries to do too much and also too little. The result is that it is very wide in its scope, but not that deep in any of its arguments.</p><p>It really feels to me like five 60-page book prospectuses stapled together, with a few linkage pages.</p><p> The five prospectuses are.:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Right Now the Future Is Big &amp; Plastic</strong>: Thus we are under a strong moral <em><strong>geas</strong></em> not to say: sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</p></li><li><p><strong>Artificial General Intelligence the Biggest Menace</strong>: Specifically, our task of developing artificial general intelligence without triggering The Robot Uprising is the most important problem facing humanity today, and one that we are not thinking nearly hard enough about.</p></li><li><p><strong>On Resilience</strong>: Avoiding human extinction, recovering from civilizational collapse, and heading-off civilizational stagnation.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Primer on Derek Parfit</strong>: Why his take on utilitarianism is right.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Manual on Giving the Future Options</strong>: Empowering those who will know more than we do by being politically active, spreading good ideas, having children, earning to give—and remember: significance x, persistence x contingency x tract, ability x neglectedness.</p></li></ol><p>I loved reading each of these five 60-page prospectus-length arguments. But iIwound up unsatisfied. I think each of these would be much better if Will had given him self space to spread out. I wish he had written five books, each of 300 pages. I would have greatly enjoyed reading them all.</p><p>This is not, of course, to say that I would have agreed with all of them (even if the odds I would wind up agreeing with any of them would have been higher if Will had been able to make his arguments at greater length.</p><p>In fact, only the third book—on how to make human civilization resilient—would get my enthusiastic endorsement and unqualified approbation (save for what I see as an excessive “Robot Uprising” tick). </p><p>The fifth book, on empowering the future, I would also approve of. I would hand it to people, saying: this is near gospel. I think the only major disagreement I would have with it is with Will MacAskill’s belief that having and raising children is among the very best things for humanity one could do. Perhaps he could convince me if he made the argument at greater length, but I doubt it. I cannot buy his conclusion that the best world is one with many many many more people than the one we are in. This is not to say that I have strong and informed views on what the size of the human population should be.  But I do know I gravely doubt anyone who thinks that they know this.</p><p>The fourth book—on Derek Parfit’s utilitarianism—would, I think, be the best written and the clearest. Will should write it! The world needs an introduction to Derek Parfit! But I would finish it unconvinced, for I find Parfit’s pushing the boundaries of utilitarianism not terribly convincing. I read Parfit. I find myself thinking: Sometimes it is just atoms in the void,  sometimes it is dancing points of light with transcendental meaning, and it switches from one to the other by rules I do not grok. So I think: If I could switch from “atoms in the void” lane to “dancing points of light with transcendental meaning” lane whenever I wanted, I could prove anything! So I am left unsatisfied.</p><p>Let me hasten to say that this does mean that Parfit is a bad philosopher, or has failed to do something he should have done. A I said at the top: <em><strong>philosophy.</strong></em> </p><p>I have, perhaps, bigger problems with the other two books whose stapled-together 60-page prospectuses make up <em>What We Owe the Future</em>. The first book—that the future is very important, and because we can have extraordinary influence over it we should prioritize working for humanity in the future over working for humanity today—I simply do not believe. Yes, we should guard against human extinction and civilizational collapse in our day. But people in the future have agency too. To say that right now humanity’s being is uniquely plastic, and thus what we do in our generation shapes the future to he end of time, and that the most important segment of humans alive today shaping the future are <em><strong>moral philosophers</strong></em>—well, that is such a stunningly grandiose denial of the Principle of Mediocrity that I find myself unable to credit it at all. We are but one link in a very long chain, even if unusual in the pace at which humanity’s wealth is increasing. We are almost surely not the only link that matters.</p><p>And as for the “Artificial General Intelligence the Biggest Menace” prospectus—this I do not understand at all. Where does this bizarre flowering of the TechBro mindset come from? Is it from people who had issues with their fathers? Is it a strange mutation of High Calvinist TULIP theology, with Robot put into the place of God? I do not grok it at all.</p><p>This has turned out to be crankier than I wanted it to be. So let me close by saying that I found reading What We Owe the Future to be enormous fun, and that if Will MacAskill had spread out and written all five books I would have had much more fun.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/reading-will-macaskills-what-we-owe?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/reading-will-macaskills-what-we-owe?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>ONE VIDEO: <strong>Martin Wolf: What’s þe Matter wiþ Britain?</strong></h2><div id="youtube2-49dqrLqj_pI" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;49dqrLqj_pI&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/49dqrLqj_pI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>The country strategy could entail… lifesciences and IT… a financial center… [as] a tax haven… a European “bridge to Asia.”… Current account deficit… a challenge….
