efore 1870, humanity lived in
dire poverty. After 1870, inven­
tion sprinted forward, doubling
humanity’s technological capabilities

each generation and so revolutioniz­
ing the economy over and over again.
Virtually all our ancestors would have
presumed we would use such powers
to  make today’s world a utopia. Not so.
By 2010, the world instead saw global
warming; economic depression, uncer­
tainty,  and  inequality;  and  growing
populist backlash.

In  Slouching  Towards  Utopia,
acclaimed  economist  J.  Bradford
DeLong  tells  the  dramatic  story  of
how this explosion of material wealth
occurred, how it transformed the globe,
and  why it failed to deliver utopia. The
market economy’s supercharged growth

revolutionized the world. But people

urges us to heed the twentieth centu­
ry’s lessons as we enter an even more
uncertain new era.

SLOUCHING TOWARDS UTOPIA

“Brad DeLong learnedly and grippingly tells the story of
how all the economic growth since 1870 has created a global
economy that today satisfies no ones ideas of fairness. The
long journey toward economic justice and more equal rights

and opportunities for all shall and will continue?

“History provides the only data we have for charting a
course forward in these turbulent times. I have not seen a more

revealing and illuminating book about economics and what

it means in a very long time. Slouching Towards Utopia should be
required reading for anybody who cares about the future of

the global system, and that should be everyone.”

-LAWRENCE H. SUMMERS, Harvard University

“What a joy to finally have Brad DeLong’s
masterful interpretation of twentieth-century economic history

down on paper. Slouching Towards Utopia is engaging,
important, and awe-inspiring in its breadth and creativity.”

—CHRISTINA ROMER, University of California, Berkeley
