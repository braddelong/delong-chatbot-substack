Famous quotes, the way a woman would have to say them during a meeting.

Opinion by Alexandra Petri Columnist


Oct. 13,2015 at 3:37 p.m. PDT

a€oeAfew weeks ago at work,a€D Jennifer Lawrence wrote in an essay for Lenny (yup, I guess Ia€™m 
subscribed to Lenny now! Well played, Lena Dunham). a€oel spoke my mind and gave my opinion in a 
clear and no-[BS] way; no aggression, just blunt. The man I was working with (actually, he was 
working for me) said, a€~Whoa! Wea€™re all on the same team here!a€™ As if I was yelling at him. I 
was so shocked because nothing that I said
was personal, offensive, or, to be honest, wrong. All I hear and see all day are men speaking their 
opinions, and I give mine in the same exact manner, and you would have thought I had said something 
offensive.a€D

Nailed ita€!
