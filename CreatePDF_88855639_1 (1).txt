CONDITION: No Excuse for Anyone to Vote for This Republican Party Ever Again:

Charlie Sykes: Terminating the Constitution: a€~In the last two weeks, Donald Trump pledged 
solidarity with the January 6 rioters, dined with two Holocaust-denying fans of Adolf Hitler, and 
called for the termination of the Constitution. And he remains the front-runner and clear favorite 
for the GOP nomination for president in 2024a€l.

Charlie Sykes @SykesCharlie

Tuesday: Oath Keepers found guilty of "seditious conspiracy." Saturday: Trump: "Hold my beer."

•Donald J. Trump O

So, with the revelation of MASSIVE & WIDESPREAD FRAUD & DECEPTION in
closely with Big Tech Companies, the DNC, & the Democrat Party,

do you throw the Presidential Election Results of 2020 OUT and declare the
RIGHTFUL WINNER, or do you have a NEW ELECTION? A Massive Fraud of
this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations,

and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Our great "Founders" did
not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!

JesusMaryandJosephandtheweedonkey, Trump put it in writing.

A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, 
and articles, even those found in the Constitution.

This was not a one off. As Mike Pencea€™ s former chief of staff, Marc Short noted on Meet the 
Press, Trumpa€™ s attack on the Constitution was consistent with a€oewhat he asked the vice 
president to do two years ago, when rioters were attacking the Capitol and he asked the vice 
president to overturn the election results .a€Da€ I Goddam right I orchestrated coup to overthrow 
the Constitution a€” and Ia€™ ll do it again! On Earth 2.0 (a rational and
totally imaginary world), this would be the clearest, easiest, most obvious moment for Republicans 
to rid themselves of this troublesome and deranged demagoguea€l

Scott Lemieux: Party owned by Donald Trump fine with Donald Trumpa€™ s call to end American 
democracy: a€~My position remains that Ia€™ 11 believe hea€™ s seriously vulnerable in a primary 
when I see it: [Amy Wang:] a€oeDonald Trumpa€™ s suggestion this weekend that the U.S. Constitution 
should be terminated in response to his baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen drew a 
largely muted response from Republicansa€l. Only a
handful of Republican lawmakers have joined the White House and Democrats in condemning Trumpa€l. 
Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) anda€l Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not respond on Sunday to requests for 
commenta€l. Some GOP lawmakers who were asked on Sunday political shows about Trumpa€™ s latest 
missive said they disagreed with the former president. However, most still hesitated to say that 
they would oppose Trump if he becomes the
GOPa€™ s 2024 presidential nomineea€l

FOCUS: Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;/Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world:



Well! This is certainly a nice peroration!:

Noah Smith: My cyberpunk city, my cyberpunk world: a€~In 2019 I found myself standing on the roof 
of a skyscraper in Hong Kong next to a friend in a gas mask as the citya€™ s youth and mirror-faced 
riot police battled each other with tear gas and firebombs in the electric forest of the 
megalopolis belowa€!. People around the world fought their governments and their local police 
forces in the streets, coordinating and inspiring each
other and outfoxing the authorities using a global wireless communication network linked to pocket 
supercomputers running pseudonymous social media servicesa€!. A sudden global plaguea€!. In the 
wake of the plague came war. Dronesa€l quickly became the indispensable, universal battlefield 
weapon. Where soldiers once sent poetrya€! now they sent high-quality videos, often with a 
soundtrack from popular musica€!. Government
operatives, and online fandoms spewing out clouds of information and disinformation a€” great-power 
politics played out in forum flame-wars.

Far from the war, I walk through the streets of a strange cyberpunk city. I step around the 
homeless, destitute people who fill the streets, forsaken by their increasingly distant government. 
Strange people roll past me on one-wheels carrying boomboxes blasting 90s rap, fly drones in the 
park, scoot around in homemade go-karts, or drive miniature fake firetrucks blasting sound effects 
from Godzilla. And laid over this gritty, failing,
beautiful metropolis like a second city: the network of the eccentric barons of techno-capital and 
their hired geniusesa€l. That girl with the chrome hair and the black leotard and the gizmos 
implanted under her skin? I know that girl, she lives down the street from me.

We felt this future cominga€!. Gibson, Stephenson, Shirow, Oshii, Sterling, Cadigan, and all the 
other cyberpunk creators were simply offering us alternative little slices of a future we all felt 
being born around us. And now wea€™re herea€!

This is the world of unbelievable and strange information technologies and extraordinary, unequal 
wealth, coupled with social dysfunction, and with a great many people straining their every nerve 
and muscle to figure out how to misinformed people and hack their brains.
I                                                                                                   
                       do confess I did not think a major reason for the bad actors to do what they 
do would be a€oeto sell adsa€D.

Wondrous strange it all isa€!

And now GPT-Chat provides us with a first glimpse into what A Young Ladya€™ s Illustratred Primer 
would be like:

Write 500 words telling me what Stephenson's "A Young Lady's Illustrated
Primer" would report to its reader about the rise of neofascism and
Trumpism                                                         in the 2010s


In  Stephenson's  "A  Young  Lady's  Illustrated  Primer,"  the  rise  of  neofascism  &
and Trumpism in the 2010s would likely be portrayed as a concerning
development  that  threatens  the  progress  and  stability  of  society.  The

Primer, which is a fictional educational tool designed to teach young girls
critical  thinking  and  problem-solving  skills,  would  likely  use  its  interactive
format  and  engaging  narratives  to  explore  the  dangers  of  authoritarianism
and the importance of standing up for democracy and equality.

The Primer might begin by explaining the historical origins of fascism and
its relevance to the present day. It might describe how fascist ideologies,
which emphasize the need for a strong, authoritarian leader to restore
order  and national greatness, have resurfaced in various forms over the

years. The Primer might highlight the role of economic and social insecurity
in fueling the rise of fascist movements, and how these movements often
target  marginalized  groups,  such  as  immigrants  and  minorities,  as
scapegoats   for society's problems.

Next, the Primer would likely turn its attention to the specific rise of
neofascism and Trumoism in the 2010s. It miaht describe how Trumo. a


former reality TV star and businessman with no political experience, rode a
wave of populist anger and resentment to win the presidency in 2016. The
Primer might detail how Trump's rhetoric, which often included divisive,
xenophobic, and misogynistic language, appealed to many Americans who
felt disillusioned and left behind by the political establishment.

The Primer would then delve into the consequences of the Trump
presidency. It might discuss how Trump and his supporters pursued a far-
right                                                  agenda that included crackdowns on 
immigration, attacks on the
media and the rule of law, and efforts to roll back civil rights and
environmental protections. The Primer might also explore how Trump's
divisive policies and behavior sparked widespread protests and resistance,
both within the United States and around the world.

Throughout its examination of the rise of neofascism and Trumpism, the
Primer would emphasize the importance of standing up for democracy,
equality, and the rule of law. It might offer examples of individuals and
groups                                                       who have bravely resisted the rise of 
authoritarianism, and provide
tools and strategies for others to do the same. The Primer would likely

AJs:

I confess that I really cannot accept scenarios logic here. There is a huge demand for safe assets, 
a shortage of risk, bearing capacity, and governments with exorbitant privilege have enormous 
powers of financial repression. It seems to me that soft landings are easily attainable with a dose 
of financial repression.1 confess that I really cannot accept scenarios logic here. There is a huge 
demand for safe assets, a shortage of risk, bearing capacity, and governments
with exorbitant privilege have enormous powers of financial repression. It seems to me that soft 
landings are easily attainable with a dose of financial repression and a dose of governmentsaC™ 
willingness to deploy the risk bearing capacity of rich taxpayers (against their will, I admit). 
That there is a path between Scylla and Charybdis does not mean that that path will be taken, of 
course:

Nouriel Roubini: The Unavoidable Crash: a€~Much borrowing goes simply to finance consumption 
spending above onea€™ s income.... Moreover, investments in a€oecapitala€D can also be risky.... 
Over-borrowing has been going on for decadesa€! the democratization of finance.... center-right 
governments have persistently cut taxesa€! years of quantitative easing (QE) and credit easing kept 
borrowing costs near zero.  The

explosion of unsustainable debt ratios implied that many borrowersaC’’households, corporations, 
banks, shadow banks, governments, and even entire countriesa€”were insolvent a€oezombiesa€D that 
were being propped up by low interest rates (which kept their debt-servicing costs manageable)a€I. 
Insolvent agents that would have gone bankrupt were rescued by zero- or negative-interest-rate 
policies, QE, and outright fiscal
bailoutsa€!. Now... zombies are experiencing sharp increases in their debt-servicing costsa€! the 
return of stagflation^! the pandemica€™ s disruptions... Russiaa€™ s war in Ukraine... Chinaa€™ s 
increasingly disastrous zero-COVID policy.... Simply bailing out private and public agents with 
loose macro policies would pour more gasoline on the inflationary fire. That means there will be a 
hard landing. Central-bank deficit

monetization will once again be seen as the path of least resistance. But you cannot fool all of 
the people all of the time.... The mother of all stagflationary debt crises can be postponed, not 
avoided...

I think those who asked "why arena€™t the Democrats supporting the good-guy Republicans" have been 
answered: there are next to no good-guy Republicans:

Meghan MacPherson: Trump's call to suspend Constitution not a 2024 deal-breaker, leading House 
Republican says: a€~Republican Ohio Rep. Dave Joycea€!. Chair of the Republican Governance Group, a 
centrist group in the Housea€!. Joyce ultimately said that Trump's comment should be taken "in 
context" but that it wouldn't prevent him from supporting Trump if he ends up winning the 
nominationa€l

Very nice to see this attention for Glory Liua€™ s book!a€D:

Rebecca Brenner Graham: Why the Philosophers Libertarians Love Always Come Out Worse for Wear: 
a€~Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek have been through the wringer: What isolated me most from the 
libertarians I met was our approach to history.  Two recent books take on some of the Mercatus 
Centera€™ s favorite political-economic philosophers, proving, I think, my point. Burning Down the 
House: How Libertarian

Philosophy Was Corrupted by Delusion and Greed, by legal scholar Andrew Koppelman, claims that 
American libertarians have distorted Hayeka€™ s ideals. Adam Smitha€™ s America: How a Scottish 
Philosopher Became an Icon of American Capitalism, by political scientist Glory Liu, shows how 
Americans have perceived Adam Smith and his ideas over time. Both aim to follow best practices in 
historical thought, such as change
over time and the provision of tons and tons of context...

a€oeA fast-working interna€D is a good characterization. But I prefer Noah Smith and Roona€™ s 
a€oeautocomplete for everythinga€n:

Ethan Mollick: The Mechanical Professor: a€~Take a job I know well, and try to see how far I can 
automate it with AIa€!. Think of it like having an intern, but one who just happens to work 
instanteously, can write both code and solid descriptive writing, and has a large chunk of the 
worlda€™ s knowledge in their braina€!. Start with a core duty of professorsa€!. I ask it: Create a 
syllabus for a 12 session MBA-level introduction to
entrepreneurship class, and provide the first four sessions. For each, include readings and 
assignments, as well as a summary of what will be covered. Include class policies at the end. The 
results are impressivea€!
