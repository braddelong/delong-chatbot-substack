However, this measure is problematic on several different dimensions. First, the idea that it is possible to separate out the relative contribution to economic output of labor, capital, and technology requires ignoring their complex interdependence… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/technology-and-productivity-a-critique-of-aggregate-indicators">https://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/technology-and-productivity-a-critique-of-aggregate-indicators</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>In <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em>, I start by asserting that we can create a rough guide to the level of “technology”—to the value of the stock of useful ideas about productively manipulating nature and organizing humans that have been discovered, developed, deployed, and diffused throughout the world economy—by simply taking our estimate of the average level of real income per person, and multiplying it by the square-root of population. (Why the square-root? Well, if we took “technology” to be average income times the population, we would be assuming that labor was not productive at all; if we took “technology” to be just average income, we would be assuming that resource scarcity was unimportant; both of those have to be wrong.) </p><p>I then note a global historical discontinuity around 1870:</p><ul><li><p>Before 1870, the proportional rate of growth of “technology” so measured was 0.45%/year worldwide (and 0.9%/year in the charmed “Dover Circle” economies), and was hostage to two processes—the non-exhaustion of extremely cheap coal and to the centrality of the concentration of industry into the Dover Circle—which were both reaching their limits.</p></li><li><p>After 1870, the proportional growth rate of “technology” so measured was 2.1%/year worldwide (and 2.3%/year in the charmed “Dover Circle” economies). </p></li></ul><p>Before 1870, given human fecundity, growth was not rapid enough to push incomes high enough to trigger a global fertility decline and the demographic transition: it was doubtful that even a continuation of growth at the pre-1870 pace would be enough to move humanity out of its desperately poor Malthusian equilibrium, and a continuation of that growth might well not have been in the cards.</p><p>After 1870, humanity was no longer ensorcelled by the demon of Malthus. Instead, we were on the road to economic El Dorado: a truly rich and, if only we could manage the process of becoming and being rich, utopian world was in our grasp as the level of technology rose from 1 in 1870 to 21 in 2010, giving humanity godlike and individuals the potential for near-godlike powers by the standards of previous eras.</p><p>And the book is about managing this upward leap from 1 to 21 in technology: using technology to bake a large-enough economic pie, building social institutions to fairly and equitably slice the pie, and then the psychological issues of properly tasting—enjoying—the pie so that people could be healthy, and feel safe, secure, and happy.</p><p>But there is no gigantic machine buried in the earth which emanates technology all over the world so that everyone everywhere becomes better at making and doing things; there is no single dial which rotates clockwise from the ‘1’ to the ‘21’ marker between 1870 and 2010. To even claim that there is a meaningful aggregate numerical measure of anything that we can call "technology" is to commit a major logical and conceptual error. “Technology” is more like “anger” or “happiness than it is like “temperature” or “mass”: not quantifiable in any reasonable and consistent way. Back in 1936 John Maynard Keynes strongly warned precisely against doing this kind of thing:</p><blockquote><p>proposition[s] of a similar character to the statement that Queen Victoria was a better queen but not a happier woman than Queen Elizabeth… not without meaning and not without interest, but unsuitable as material for the differential calculus. Our precision will be a mock precision if we try to use such partly vague and non-quantitative concepts as the basis of a quantitative analysis…<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></p></blockquote><p>Yet I do use the differential calculus, and do use “mock precision” in stating that the worldwide-diffused level of technology grew from 0.27 in the year 150 to 0.43 in 1500 to 0.64 in 1770 to 1 in 1870 to 21 in 2010 (and 25 today). There is a sense in which 1 worker today in 2022 can on average do the work it took 25 to do back in 1870, and that it took 92 to do back in 150 and 150 workers to do back in the year -1000.</p><p>On the other hand: to feed the dogs from food scraps, and to make sure that the rapid-eating poodle-lab mix (50 pounds) does not eat her own food, and then drive the dainty-eating boxer-huskie-shepherd-pit bull-great pyrenees mix (75 pounds) off of his, and devour it—that takes as much human time and effort today as it took in -1000. </p><p>Yet nobody had to get up before dawn to kindle a fire so that my study would be suitably comfortable when I came down to it this morning (and a “study” in which I can see 700 of my books, and have access to millions instantly through the magic mirror device on which I am typing right now, did not exist as a room possibility back in -1000), and the fully-amortized cost of our furnace plus the natural gas to fuel it is $1/day—4 minutes’ work at the current California minimum wage.</p><p>And all the people alive in the world in -1000—or, indeed, in 1870—could not have, working together full-time, produced a single dose of the antibiotics we have stored in our medicine cabinet.</p><p>Some prices do not change at all. Some prices change in a calculable way. Some prices drop from +∞ to something expensive; some prices drop from +∞ to somethig cheap; some prices drop from something calculable to effectively zero. What utility is there in reporting some single number and claiming that it is a meaningful average of such a distribution of price changes?</p><p>In <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em>, I do not deal with these issues <em><strong>at all</strong></em>.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/fine-graining-technological-progress?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/fine-graining-technological-progress?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Chang-Tai Hsieh</strong>: <em>Two Strong Hands: China’s Vision for the Private Sector</em> &lt;<a href="https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=YngVgVpclF0">https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=YngVgVpclF0</a>&gt;: </p><div id="youtube2-YngVgVpclF0" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;YngVgVpclF0&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YngVgVpclF0?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay;

class="paywall-jump"></div><h2>Paragraphs:</h2><p>The gap in social power between members of the élite and the masses of the people was greater in Europe than in China. As a broad generalization, that might well be true: access to the levers of any of military, bureaucratic, or clerical power in Europe typically gave you powers of domination that were very difficult to resist; but even a poor person in China would have a clan network that they could use as a source of social power vis-à-vis any single command from a member of the élite. The gap in social power between the state and the élite was greater in China than in Europe. As a broad generalization, that also might well be true. But what we are hunting is how social and cultural patterns durably alter the long run incentives for, in Baumol’s words, positive-sum rather than negative-sum "entrepreneurship”. And that seems to meto depend much more on what is going on at the margins:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ruixue Jia, Gérard Roland, &amp; Yang Xie</strong>: <em>A Theory of Power Structure &amp; Institutional Compatibility: China vs. Europe Revisited</em>: ‘The literature on institutions and development contrasts inclusive societies with extractive ones, while the scholarship comparing Imperial China and Premodern Europe defies this dichotomy. To reconcile these views, we model the institutional differences between the two societies along two dimensions of their power structure: the Ruler’s absolute power was weaker in Europe, whereas the Elite–People relationship in terms of their power and rights was more balanced in China. Our model shows that a more balanced Elite–People relationship can be compatible with a more absolutist Ruler. The model also helps interpret differences in specific institutions and autocratic stability…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ruixuejia.com/uploads/4/6/3/3/46339953/power22march.pdf">https://www.ruixuejia.com/uploads/4/6/3/3/46339953/power22march.pdf</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>And so the key question becomes: why were "European" powers willing to fight each other over there imperial interests in the near-periphery—in the Balkans and the Middle East—while they were not willing to fight each other over imperial interests in Africa or Asia? There was, as Bismarck said, “nothing in the Balkans worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier”:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Dominic Lieven</strong>: <em>The End of Tsarist Russia: The March to World War I &amp; Revolution</em>: ‘Russian ambitions at Constantinople and the Straits have to be seen within the context of an imperialist age, in which the British took over Egypt to secure their hold on the Suez Canal and the Americans seized the Isthmus of Panama in order to control the key strategic and commercial highway between the Atlantic and the Pacific. As we shall see, the Straits on balance mattered more to Russia than even Suez or Panama did to the British or the Americans…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/endoftsaristruss0000liev">https://archive.org/details/endoftsaristruss0000liev</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Just how much of a crackpot den Stanford’s Hoover Institution is—that is something that it is difficult for outsiders to grasp. Richard Epstein’s insistence on “respect” for his claim that COVID-19 was highly likely to kill less than 500 people in the United States is only one example:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Isaac Chotiner &amp; Richard Epstein</strong>: <em>The Contrarian Coronavirus Theory That Informed the Trump Administration</em>: ‘Richard, with all due respect, your article is apparently circulating in conservative circles in Washington and the White House. <strong>I didn’t write it as a conservative article. Donald Trump’s name is not mentioned in it.</strong> I grasped that. <strong>I’m not interested in politics.</strong>… I know, but these are scientific issues here. <strong>You know nothing about the subject but are so confident that you’re going to say that I’m a crackpot.</strong> No. Richard— <strong>That’s what you’re saying, isn’t it?

I’m an amateur? You’re the great scholar on this?</strong> No, no. I’m not a great scholar on this. <strong>Tell me what you think about the quality of the work!</strong> O.K. I’m going to tell you. I think the fact that I am not a great scholar on this and I’m able to find these flaws or these holes in what you wrote is a sign that maybe you should’ve thought harder before writing it. <strong>What it shows is that you are a complete intellectual amateur. Period.</strong> O.K. Can I ask you one more question? <strong>You just don’t know anything about anything. You’re a journalist. Would you like to compare your résumé to mine?</strong> No, actually, I would not. <strong>Then good. Then maybe what you want to do is to say, “Gee, I’m not quite sure that this is right.

Among the three dozen signatories of the statement, in addition to the aforementioned editors, are Patrick Deneen and Michael Anton, two post-liberal luminaries on the right, and Glenn Greenwald and Samuel Moyn, stalwart men of the left. “Leading interventionists in the United States and Europe,” reads the first line of the statement, “are goading the West into an abyss of war and suffering, from which there can be no easy return.”… The “urgent” danger the war poses is not only Russian “imperial aggrandizement” but also Western “schemes of regime change,” which are “fantasies” that “invite still larger catastrophes.”… Ukrainians are not the only victims of the conflagration: “Ordinary Russians… are caught in the dragnet of indiscriminate Western sanctions. Crude anti-Russian attacks—directed against artists, athletes… who bear no responsibility for Kremlin actions—threaten to embitter a generation.”… The statement’s opening line—“Leading interventionists in the United States and Europe are goading the West into an abyss of war and suffering”—stands matters on their head…. Then there is the statement’s remarkable attempt to place blame for the bloodshed on Ukraine itself. Ukraine is faulted for its “attempt to bog down Moscow in a long, devastating insurgency,” as if this is an eventuality that Kyiv invited or desires…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/moral-equivalence-and-ukraine">https://www.lawfareblog.com/moral-equivalence-and-ukraine</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p></p><div class="footnote"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p><strong>John Maynard Keyne</strong>s (1936): <em>The General Theory of Employment, Interest &amp; Money</em> <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch04.htm">&lt;https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch04.htm</a>&gt;</p></div></div>
