THE political personality of Soviet power as we know it today is the product of ideology and 
circumstances: ideology inherited by the present Soviet leaders from the movement in which they had 
their political origin, and circumstances of the power which they now have exercised for nearly 
three decades in Russia. There can be few tasks of psychological analysis more difficult than to 
try to trace the interaction of these two forces and the relative r61e of each
in the determination of official Soviet conduct. Yet the attempt must be made if that conduct is to 
be understood and effectively countered.

It is difficult to summarize the set of ideological concepts with which the Soviet leaders came 
into power. Marxian ideology, in its Russian-Communist projection, has always been in process of 
subtle evolution. The materials on which it bases itself are extensive and complex. But the 
outstanding features of Communist thought as it existed in 1916 may perhaps be summarized as 
follows: (a) that the central factor in the life of man, the factor which determines the
character of public life and the a€oephysiognomy of society,a€D is the system by which material 
goods are produced and exchanged; (b) that the capitalist system of production is a nefarious one 
which inevitably leads to the exploitation of the working class by the capital-owning class and is 
incapable of developing adequately the economic resources of society or of distributing fairly the 
material goods produced by human labor; (c) that capitalism contains the
seeds of its own destruction and must, in view of the inability of the capital-owning class to 
adjust itself to economic change, result eventually and inescapably in a revolutionary transfer of 
power to the working class; and (d) that imperialism, the final phase of capitalism, leads directly 
to war and revolution.

The rest may be outlined in Lenina€™ s own words: "Unevenness of economic and political development 
is the inflexible law of capitalism. It follows from this that the victory of Socialism may come 
originally in a few capitalist countries or even in a single capitalist country. The victorious 
proletariat of that country, having expropriated the capitalists and having organized Socialist 
production at home, would rise against the remaining capitalist world, drawing
to itself in the process the oppressed classes of other countries.a€oea€™ It must be noted that 
there was no assumption that capitalism would perish without proletarian revolution. A final push 
was needed from a revolutionary proletariat movement in order to tip over the tottering structure. 
But it was regarded as inevitable that sooner or later that push be given.

For 50 years prior to the outbreak of the Revolution, this pattern of thought had exercised great 
fascination for the members of the Russian revolutionary movement. Frustrated, discontented, 
hopeless of finding self-expression a€” or too impatient to seek ita€”in the confining limits of 
the Tsarist political system, yet lacking wide popular support for their choice of bloody 
revolution as a means of social betterment, these revolutionists found in Marxist theory a
highly convenient rationalization for their own instinctive desires. It afforded pseudo-scientific 
justification for their impatience, for their categoric denial of all value in the Tsarist system, 
for their yearning for power and revenge and for their inclination to cut corners in the pursuit of 
it. It is therefore no wonder that they had come to believe implicitly in the truth and soundness 
of the Marxian-Leninist teachings, so congenial to their own impulses and emotions.

Their sincerity need not be impugned. This is a phenomenon as old as human nature itself. It has 
never been more aptly described than by Edward Gibbon, who wrote in a€ETThe Decline and Fall of the 
Roman Empirea€oe:

From enthusiasm to imposture the step is perilous and slippery; the demon of Socrates affords a 
memorable instance how a wise man may deceive himself, how a good man may deceive others, how the 
conscience may slumber in a mixed and middle state between self-illusion and voluntary fraud.

And it was with this set of conceptions that the members of the Bolshevik Party entered into power. 
Now it must be noted that through all the years of preparation for revolution, the attention of 
these men, as indeed of Marx himself, had been centered less on the future form which Socialism 
would take than on the necessary overthrow of rival power which, in their view, had to precede the 
introduction of Socialism. Their views, therefore, on the positive program
to be put into effect, once power was attained, were for the most part nebulous, visionary and 
impractical. Beyond the nationalization of industry and the expropriation of large private capital 
holdings there was no agreed program.

The treatment of the peasantry, which according to the Marxist formulation was not of the 
proletariat, had always been a vague spot in the pattern of Communist thought; and it remained an 
object of controversy and vacillation for the first ten years of Communist power. The circumstances 
of the immediate post-revolution perioda€”the existence in Russia of civil war and foreign 
intervention, together with the obvious fact that the Communists represented only a
tiny minority of the Russian peoplea€”made the establishment of dictatorial power a necessity. The 
experiment with a€oewar Communisma€D and the abrupt attempt to eliminate private production and 
trade had unfortunate economic consequences and caused further bitterness against the new 
revolutionary regime. While the temporary relaxation of the effort to communize Russia, represented 
by the New Economic Policy, alleviated some of this economic
distress and thereby served its purpose, it also made it evident that the a€oecapitalistic sector 
of societya€D was still prepared to profit at once from any relaxation of governmental pressure, 
and would, if permitted to continue to exist, always constitute a powerful opposing element to the 
Soviet regime and a serious rival for influence in the country.

Somewhat the same situation prevailed with respect to the individual peasant who, in his own small 
way, was also a private producer. Lenin, had he lived, might have proved a great enough man to 
reconcile these conflicting forces to the ultimate benefit of Russian society, though this is 
questionable. But be that as it may, Stalin, and those whom he led in the struggle for succession 
toLenina€™ s    position of leadership, were not the men to tolerate rival politi
forces in the sphere of power which they coveted. Their sense of insecurity was too great. Their 
particular brand of fanaticism, unmodified by any of the Anglo-Saxon traditions of compromise, was 
too fierce and too jealous to envisage any permanent sharing of power. From the Russian-Asiatic 
world out of which they had emerged they carried with them a skepticism as to the possibilities of 
permanent and peaceful coexistence of rival forces. Easily persuaded

of their own doctrinaire a€(Brightness,a€D they insisted on the submission or destruction of all 
competing power. Outside of the Communist Party, Russian society was to have no rigidity. There 
were to be no forms of collective human activity or association which would not be dominated by the 
Party. No other force in Russian society was to be permitted to achieve vitality or integrity. Only 
the Party was to have structure. All else was to be an amorphous mass.
And within the Party the same principle was to apply. The mass of Party members might go through 
the motions of election, deliberation, decision and action; but in these motions they were to be 
animated not by their own individual wills but by the awesome breath of the Party leadership and 
the overbrooding presence of a€oethe word.a€D

Let it be stressed again that subjectively these men probably did not seek absolutism for its own 
sake. They doubtless belie veda€’’and found it easy to belie vea€’’that they alone knew what was 
good for society and that they would accomplish that good once their power was secure and 
unchallengeable. But in seeking that security of their own rule they were prepared to recognize no 
restrictions, either of God or man, on the character of their methods.And until
such time as that security might be achieved, they placed far down on their scale of operational 
priorities the comforts and happiness of the peoples entrusted to their care.

Now the outstanding circumstance concerning the Soviet r6gime is that down to the present day this 
process of political consolidation has never been completed and the men in the Kremlin have 
continued to be predominantly absorbed with the struggle to secure and make absolute the power 
which they seized in November 1917. They have endeavored to secure it primarily against forces at 
home, within Soviet society itself. But they have also endeavored to
secure it against the outside world. For ideology, as we have seen, taught them that the outside 
world was hostile and that it was their duty eventually to overthrow the political forces beyond 
their borders. The powerful hands of Russian history and tradition reached up to sustain them in 
this feeling. Finally, their own aggressive intransigence with respect to the outside world began 
to find its own reaction; and they were soon forced, to use another Gibbonesque
phrase, a€oeto chastise the contumacya€O which they themselves had provoked. It is an undeniable 
privilege of every man to prove himself right in the thesis that the world is his enemy; for if he 
reiterates it frequently enough and makes it the background of his conduct he is bound eventually 
to be right.

Now it lies in the nature of the mental world of the Soviet leaders, as well as in the character of 
their ideology, that no opposition to them can be officially recognized as having any merit or 
justification whatsoever. Such opposition can flow, in theory, only from the hostile and 
incorrigible forces of dying capitalism. As long as remnants of capitalism were officially 
recognized as existing in Russia, it was possible to place on them, as an internal element, part of
the blame for the maintenance of a dictatorial form of society. But as these remnants were 
liquidated, little by little, this justification fell away; and when it was indicated officially 
that they had been finally destroyed, it disappeared altogether. And this fact created one of the 
most basic of the compulsions which came to act upon the Soviet regime: since capitalism no longer 
existed in Russia and since it could not be admitted that there could be serious or
widespread opposition to the Kremlin springing spontaneously from trie liberated masses under its 
authority, it became necessary to justify the retention of the dictatorship by stressing the menace 
of capitalism abroad.

This began at an early date. In 1924 Stalin specifically defended the retention of the a€oeorgans 
of suppression,a€D meaning, among others, the army and the secret police, on the ground that a€oeas 
long as there is a capitalist encirclement there will be danger of intervention with all the 
consequences that flow from that danger.a€D In accordance with that theory, and from that time on, 
all internal opposition forces in Russia have consistently been portrayed as
the agents of foreign forces of reaction antagonistic to Soviet power. By the same token, 
tremendous emphasis has been placed on the original Communist thesis of a basic antagonism between 
the capitalist and Socialist worlds. It is clear, from many indications, that this emphasis is not 
founded in reality. The real facts concerning it have been confused by the existence abroad of 
genuine resentment provoked by Soviet philosophy and tactics and occasionally by
the existence of great centers of military power, notably the Nazi regime in Germany and the 
Japanese Government of the late 1930a€™ s, which did indeed have aggressive designs against the 
Soviet Union.

But there is ample evidence that the stress laid in Moscow on the menace confronting Soviet society 
from the world outside its borders is founded not in the realities of foreign antagonism but in the 
necessity of explaining away the maintenance of dictatorial authority at home. Now the maintenance 
of this pattern of Soviet power, namely, the pursuit of unlimited authority domestically, 
accompanied by the cultivation of the semi-myth of implacable foreign
hostility, has gone far to shape the actual machinery of Soviet power as we know it today. Internal 
organs of administration which did not serve this purpose withered on the vine. Organs which did 
serve this purpose became vastly swollen. The security of Soviet power came to rest on the iron 
discipline of the Party, on the severity and ubiquity of the secret police, and on the 
uncompromising economic monopolism of the state. The a€oeorgans of
suppression,a€D in which the Soviet leaders had sought security from rival forces, became in large 
measure the masters of those whom they were designed to serve.

Today the major part of the structure of Soviet power is committed to the perfection of the 
dictatorship and to the maintenance of the concept of Russia as in a state of siege, with the enemy 
lowering beyond the walls. And the millions of human beings who form that part of the structure of 
power must defend at all costs this concept of Russiaa€™ s position, for without it they are 
themselves superfluous. As things stand today, the rulers can no longer dream of
parting with these organs of suppression. The quest for absolute power, pursued now for nearly 
three decades with a ruthlessness un- paralleled (in scope at least) in modern times, has again 
produced internally, as it did externally, its own reaction. The excesses of the police apparatus 
have fanned the potential opposition to the regime into something far greater and more dangerous 
than it could have been before those excesses began. But least of all can the rulers
dispense with the fiction by which the maintenance of dictatorial power has been defended. For this 
fiction has been canonized in Soviet philosophy by the excesses already committed in its name; and 
it is now anchored in the Soviet structure of thought by bonds far greater than those of mere 
ideology.

So much for the historical background. What does it spell in terms of the political personality of 
Soviet power as we know it today? Of the original ideology, nothing has been officially junked. 
Belief is maintained in the basic badness of capitalism, in the inevitability of its destruction, 
in the obligation of the proletariat to assist in that destruction and to take power into its own 
hands. But stress has come to be laid primarily on those concepts which relate most
specifically to the Soviet regime itself: to its position as the sole truly Socialist regime in a 
dark and misguided world, and to the relationships of power within it. The first of these concepts 
is that of the innate antagonism between capitalism and Socialism. We have seen how deeply that 
concept has become imbedded in foundations of Soviet power. It has profound implications for 
Russiaa€™ s conduct as a member of international society. It means that there can
never  be on Moscowa€™ s side any sincere assumption of a community of aims between the Soviet 
Union and powers which are regarded as capitalist.

It must invariably be assumed in Moscow that the aims of the capitalist world are antagonistic to 
the Soviet regime, and therefore to the interests of the peoples it controls. If the Soviet 
Government occasionally sets its signature to documents which would indicate the contrary, this is 
to be regarded as a tactical manoeuvre permissible in dealing with the enemy (who is without honor) 
and should be taken in the spirit of caveat emptor. Basically, the antagonism
remains. It is postulated. And from it flow many of the phenomena which we find disturbing in the 
Kremlina€™ s conduct of foreign policy: the secretiveness, the lack of frankness, the duplicity, 
the wary suspiciousness, and the basic unfriendliness of purpose. These phenomena are there to 
stay, for the foreseeable future.

There can be variations of degree and of emphasis. When there is something the Russians want from 
us, one or the other of these features of their policy may be thrust temporarily into the 
background; and when that happens there will always be Americans who will leap forward with gleeful 
announcements thata€oe the Russians have changed,a€D and some who will even try to take credit for 
having brought about such a€oechanges.a€D But we should not be
misled by tactical manoeuvres. These characteristics of Soviet policy, like the postulate from 
which they flow, are basic to the internal nature of Soviet power, and will be with us, whether in 
the foreground or the background, until the internal nature of Soviet power is changed. This means 
that we are going to continue for a long time to find the Russians difficult to deal with. It does 
not mean that they should be considered as embarked upon a do-or-die program
to overthrow our society by a given date. The theory of the inevitability of the eventual fall of 
capitalism has the fortunate connotation that there is no hurry about it. The forces of progress 
can take their time in preparing the final coup de grace. Meanwhile, what is vital is that the 
a€oeSocialist fatherlanda€Da€”that oasis of power which has been already won for Socialism in the 
person of the Soviet Uniona€”should be cherished and defended by all good
Communists at home and abroad, its fortunes promoted, its enemies badgered and confounded.

The promotion of premature, a€ceadventuristica€D revolutionary projects abroad which might 
embarrass Soviet power in any way would be an inexcusable, even a counter-revolutionary act. The 
cause of Socialism is the support and promotion of Soviet power, as defined in Moscow. This brings 
us to the second of the concepts important to contemporary Soviet outlook. That is the 
infallibility of the Kremlin. The Soviet concept of power, which permits no focal
points of organization outside the Party itself, requires that the Party leadership remain in 
theory the sole repository of truth. For if truth were to be found elsewhere, there would be 
justification for its expression in organized activity. But it is precisely that which the Kremlin 
cannot and will not permit. The leadership of the Communist Party is therefore always right, and 
has been always right ever since in 1929 Stalin formalized his personal power by announcing
that decisions of the Politburo were being taken unanimously. On the principle of infallibility 
there rests the iron discipline of the Communist Party. In fact, the two concepts are mutually 
self-supporting. Perfect discipline requires recognition of infallibility. Infallibility requires 
the observance of discipline. And the two together go far to determine the behaviorism of the 
entire Soviet apparatus of power.

But their effect cannot be understood unless a third factor be taken into account: namely, the fact 
that the leadership is at liberty to put forward for tactical purposes any particular thesis which 
it finds useful to the cause at any particular moment and to require the faithful and un- 
questioning acceptance of that thesis by the members of the movement as a whole. This means that 
truth is not a constant but is actually created, for all intents and purposes, by the Soviet
leaders themselves. It may vary from week to week, from month to month. It is nothing absolute and 
immutable a€” nothing which flows from objective reality. It is only the most recent manifestation 
of the wisdom of those in whom the ultimate wisdom is supposed to reside, because they represent 
the logic of history.

The accumulative effect of these factors is to give to the whole subordinate apparatus of Soviet 
power an unshakeable stubbornness and steadfastness in its orientation. This orientation can be 
changed at will by the Kremlin but by no other power. Once a given party line has been laid down on 
a given issue of current policy, the whole Soviet governmental machine, including the mechanism of 
diplomacy, moves inexorably along the prescribed path, like a
persistent toy automobile wound up and headed in a given direction, stopping only when it meets 
with some unanswerable force. The individuals who are the components of this machine are unamenable 
to argument or reason which comes to them from outside sources. Their whole training has taught 
them to mistrust and discount the glib persuasiveness of the outside world. Like the white dog 
before the phonograph, they hear only the a€oemastera€™ s
voice.a€D And if they are to be called off from the purposes last dictated to them, it is the 
master who must call them off.

Thus the foreign representative cannot hope that his words will make any impression on them. The 
most that he can hope is that they will be transmitted to those at the top, who are capable of 
changing the party line. But even those are not likely to be swayed by any normal logic in the 
words of the bourgeois representative. Since there can be no appeal to common purposes, there can 
be no appeal to common mental approaches. For this reason, facts speak louder
than words to the ears of the Kremlin; and words carry the greatest weight when they have the ring 
of reflecting, or being backed up by, facts of unchallengeable validity. But we have seen that the 
Kremlin is under no ideological compulsion to accomplish its purposes in a hurry. Like the Church, 
It is dealing in ideological concepts which are of long-term validity, and it can afford to be 
patient. It has no right to risk the existing achievements of the revolution for
the sake of vain baubles of the future. The very teachings of Lenin himself require great caution 
and flexibility in the pursuit of Communist purposes.

Again, these precepts are fortified by the lessons of Russian history: of centuries of obscure 
battles between nomadic forces over the stretches of a vast unfortified plain. Here caution, 
circumspection, flexibility and deception are the valuable qualities; and their value finds natural 
appreciation in the Russian or the oriental mind. Thus the Kremlin has no compunction about 
retreating in the face of superior force. And being under the compulsion of no timetable, it
does not get panicky under the necessity for such retreat. Its political action is a fluid stream 
which moves constantly, wherever it is permitted to move, toward a given goal. Its main concern is 
to make sure that it has filled every nook and cranny available to it in the basin of world power. 
But if it finds unassailable barriers in its path, it accepts these philosophically and 
accommodates itself to them. The main thing is that there should always be pressure,
unceasing constant pressure, toward the desired goal. There is no trace of any feeling in Soviet 
psychology that that goal must be reached at any given time. These considerations make Soviet 
diplomacy at once easier and more difficult to deal with than the diplomacy of individual 
aggressive leaders like Napoleon and Hitler. On the one hand it is more sensitive to contrary 
force, more ready to yield on individual sectors of the diplomatic front when that force is
felt to be too strong, and thus more rational in the logic and rhetoric of power. On the other hand 
it cannot be easily defeated or discouraged by a single victory on the part of its opponents. And 
the patient persistence by which it is animated means that it can be effectively countered not by 
sporadic acts which represent the momentary whims of democratic opinion but only by intelligent 
long-range policies on the part of Russiaa€™ s adversariesa€”policies no
less steadv in their purpose, and no less variegated and resourceful in their application, than 
those of the Soviet Union itself.

less steady in their purpose, and no less variegated and resourceful in their application, than 
those of the Soviet Union itself.

In these circumstances it is clear that the main element of any United States policy toward the 
Soviet Union must be that of a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian 
expansive tendencies. It is important to note, however, that such a policy has nothing to do with 
outward histrionics: with threats or blustering or superfluous gestures of outward a€D toughness." 
While the Kremlin is basically flexible in its reaction to political realities, it is
by                                                                                                  
                                                                                                    
           no means unamenable to considerations of prestige. Like almost any other government, it 
can be placed by tactless and threatening gestures in a position where it cannot afford to yield 
even though this might be dictated by its sense of realism. The Russian leaders are keen judges of 
human psychology, and as such they are highly conscious that loss of temper and of self-control is 
never a source of strength in political affairs. They are quick to exploit such
evidences of weakness. For these reasons, it is a sine qua non of successful dealing with Russia 
that the foreign government in question should remain at all times cool and collected and that its 
demands on Russian policy should be put forward in such a manner as to leave the way open for a 
compliance not too detrimental to Russian prestige.

In the light of the above, it will be clearly seen that the Soviet pressure against the free 
institutions of the western world is something that can be contained by the adroit and vigilant 
application of counter-force at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points, 
corresponding to the shifts and manoeuvres of Soviet policy, but which cannot be charmed or talked 
out of existence. The Russians look forward to a duel of infinite duration, and they see
that already they have scored great successes. It must be borne in mind that there was a time when 
the Communist Party represented far more of a minority in the sphere of Russian national life than 
Soviet power today represents in the world community. But if ideology convinces the rulers of 
Russia that truth is on their side and that they can therefore afford to wait, those of us on whom 
that ideology has no claim are free to examine objectively the validity of
that premise. The Soviet thesis not only implies complete lack of control by the west over its own 
economic destiny, it likewise assumes Russian unity, discipline and patience over an infinite 
period.

Let us bring this apocalyptic vision down to earth, and suppose that the western world finds the 
strength and resourcefulness to contain Soviet power over a period of ten to fifteen years. What 
does that spell for Russia itself? The Soviet leaders, taking advantage of the contributions of 
modern technique to the arts of despotism, have solved the question of obedience within the 
confines of their power. Few challenge their authority; and even those who do are
unable to make that challenge valid as against the organs of suppression of the state. The Kremlin 
has also proved able to accomplish its purpose of building up in Russia, regardless of the 
interests of the inhabitants, an industrial foundation of heavy metallurgy, which is, to be sure, 
not yet complete but which is nevertheless continuing to grow and is approaching those of the other 
major industrial countries.

All of this, however, both the maintenance of internal political security and the building of heavy 
industry, has been carried out at a terrible cost in human life and in human hopes and energies. It 
has necessitated the use of forced labor on a scale unprecedented in modern times under conditions 
of peace. It has involved the neglect or abuse of other phases of Soviet economic life, 
particularly agriculture, consumersa€™ goods production, housing and
transportation. To all that, the war has added its tremendous toll of destruction, death and human 
exhaustion. In consequence of this, we have in Russia today a population which is physically and 
spiritually tired. The mass of the people are disillusioned, skeptical and no longer as accessible 
as they once were to the magical attraction which Soviet power still radiates to its followers 
abroad. The avidity with which people seized upon the slight respite accorded to
the  Church for tactical reasons during the war was eloquent testimony to the fact that their 
capacity for faith and devotion found little expression in the purposes of the regime. In these 
circumstances, there are limits to the physical and nervous strength of people themselves. These 
limits are absolute ones, and are binding even for the crudest dictatorship, because beyond them 
people cannot be driven.

The forced labor camps and the other agencies of constraint provide temporary means of compelling 
people to work longer hours than their own volition or mere economic pressure would dictate; but if 
people survive them at all they become old before their time and must be considered as human 
casualties to the demands of dictatorship. In either case their best powers are no longer available 
to society and can no longer be enlisted in the service of the state.
Here only the younger generation can help. The younger generation, despite all vicissitudes and 
sufferings, is numerous and vigorous; and the Russians are a talented people. But it still re-mains 
to be seen what will be the effects on mature performance of the abnormal emotional strains of 
childhood which Soviet dictatorship created and which were enormously increased by the war. Such 
things as normal security and placidity of home environment have
practically ceased to exist in the Soviet Union outside of the most remote farms and villages. And 
observers are not yet sure whether that is not going to leave its mark on the over-all capacity of 
the generation now coming into maturity.

In addition to this, we have the fact that Soviet economic development, while it can list certain 
formidable achievements, has been precariously spotty and uneven. Russian Communists who speak of 
the a€oeuneven development of capitalisma€D should blush at the contemplation of their own national 
economy. Here certain branches of economic life, such as the metallurgical and machine industries, 
have been pushed out of all proportion to other sectors of
economy. Here is a nation striving to become in a short period one of the great industrial nations 
of the world while it still has no highway network worthy of the name and only a relatively 
primitive network of railways. Much has been done to increase efficiency of labor and to teach 
primitive peasants something about the operation of machines. But maintenance is still a crying 
deficiency of all Soviet economy. Construction is hasty and poor in quality.

Depreciation must De enormous. And in vast sectors of economic life it has not yet been possible to 
instill into labor anything like that general culture of production and technical self-respect 
which characterizes the skilled worker of the west.

It is difficult to see how these deficiencies can be corrected at an early date by a tired and 
dispirited population working largely under the shadow of fear and compulsion. And as long as they 
are not overcome, Russia will remain economically a vulnerable, and in a certain sense an impotent, 
nation, capable of exporting its enthusiasms and of radiating the strange cnarm of its primitive 
political vitality but unable to back up those articles of ex-port by the real
evidences of material power and prosperity.

Meanwhile, a great uncertainty hangs over the political life of the Soviet Union. That is the 
uncertainty involved in the transfer of power from one individual or group of individuals to 
others. This is, of course, outstandingly the problem of the personal position of Stalin. We must 
remember that his succession to Lenina€™ s pinnacle of preeminence in the Communist movement was 
the only such transfer of individual authority which the Soviet Union has
experienced. That transfer took 12 years to consolidate. It cost the lives of millions of people 
and shook the state to its foundations. The attendant tremors were felt all through the 
international revolutionary movement, to the disadvantage of the Kremlin itself. It is always 
possible that another transfer of preeminent power may take place quietly and inconspicuously, with 
no repercussions anywhere. But again, it is possible that the questions in- involved may
unleash,  to use some of Lenina€™ s words, one of those a€oeincredibly swift transitionsa€D from 
a€oedelicate deceita€D to a€oewild violencea€D which characterize Russian history, and may shake 
Soviet power to its foundations. But this is not only a question of Stalin himself.

There has been, since 1938, a dangerous congealment of political life in the higher circles of 
Soviet power. The All-Union Congress of Soviets, in theory the supreme body of the Party, is 
supposed to meet not less often than once in three years. It will soon be eight full years since 
its last meeting. During this period membership in the Party has numerically doubled. Party 
mortality during the war was enormous; and today well over half of the Party members are
persons who have entered since the last Party congress was held. Meanwhile, the same small group of 
men has carried on at the top through an amazing series of national vicissitudes. Surely there is 
some reason why the experiences of the war brought basic political changes to every one of the 
great governments of the west. Surely the causes of that phenomenon are basic enough to be present 
somewhere in the obscurity of Soviet political life, as well. And yet
no recognition has been given to these causes in Russia. It must be surmised from this that even 
within so highly disciplined an organization as the Communist Party there must be a growing 
divergence in age, outlook and interest between the great mass of Party members, only so recently 
recruited into the movement, and the little self-perpetuating clique of men at the top, whom most 
of these Party members have never met, with whom they have never
conversed, and with whom they can have no political intimacy.

Who can say whether, in these circumstances, the eventual rejuvenation of the higher spheres of 
authority (which can only be a matter of time) can take place smoothly and peacefully, or whether 
rivals in the quest for higher power will not eventually reach down into these politically immature 
and inexperienced masses in order to find support for their respective claims? If this were ever to 
happen, strange consequences could flow for the Communist Party: for
the membership at large has been exercised only in the practices of iron discipline and obedience 
and not in the arts of compromise and accommodation. And if disunity were ever to seize and 
paralyze the Party, the chaos and weakness of Russian society would be revealed in forms beyond 
description. For we have seen that Soviet power is only a crust concealing an amorphous mass of 
human beings among whom no independent organizational structure is
tolerated.

In Russia there is not even such a thing as local government. The present generation of Russians 
have never known spontaneity of collective action. If, consequently, anything were ever to occur to 
disrupt the unity and efficacy of the Party as a political instrument, Soviet Russia might be 
changed overnight from one of the strongest to one of the weakest and most pitiable of national 
societies. Thus the future of Soviet power may not be by any means as secure as
Russian capacity for self-delusion would make it appear to the men in the Kremlin. That they can 
keep power themselves, they have demonstrated. That they can quietly and easily turn it over to 
others remains to be proved. Meanwhile, the hardships of their rule and the vicissitudes of 
international life have taken a heavy toll of the strength and hopes of the great people on whom 
their power rests.

It is curious to note that the ideological power of Soviet authority is strongest today in areas 
beyond the frontiers of Russia, beyond the reach of its police power. This phenomenon brings to 
mind a comparison used by Thomas Mann m his great novel a€oe Buddenbrooks.a€D Observing that human 
in- institutions often show the greatest outward brilliance at a moment when inner decay is in 
reality farthest advanced, he compared the Buddenbrook family, in the
days of its greatest glamour, to one of those stars whose light shines most brightly on this world 
when in reality it has long since ceased to exist. And who can say with assurance that the strong 
light still cast by the Kremlin on the dissatisfied peoples of the western world is not the 
powerful afterglow of a constellation which is in actuality on the wane? This cannot be proved. And 
it cannot be disproved. But the possibility remains (and in the opinion of this writer
it is a strong one) that Soviet power, like the capitalist world of its conception, bears within it 
the seeds of its own decay, and that the sprouting of these seeds is well advanced.

It is clear that the United States cannot expect in the foreseeable future to enjoy political 
intimacy with the Soviet regime. It must continue to regard the Soviet Union as a rival, not a 
partner, in the political arena. It must continue to expect that Soviet policies will reflect no 
abstract love of peace and stability, no real faith in the possibility of a permanent happy 
coexistence of the Socialist and capitalist worlds, but rather a cautious, persistent pressure 
toward the
disruption and weakening of all rival influence and rival power. Balanced against this are the 
facts that Russia, as opposed to the western world in general, is still by far the weaker party, 
that Soviet policy is highly flexible, and that Soviet society may well contain deficiencies which 
will eventually weaken its own total potential.

This would of itself warrant the United States entering with reasonable confidence upon a policy of 
firm containment, designed to confront the Russians with unalterable counter-force at every point 
where they show signs of encroaching upon the interests of a peaceful and stable world. But in 
actuality the possibilities for American policy are by no means limited to holding the line and 
hoping for the best. It is entirely possible for the United States to influence by
its actions the internal developments, both within Russia and throughout the international 
Communist movement, by which Russian policy is largely determined. This is not only a question of 
the modest measure of informational activity which this government can conduct in the Soviet Union 
and elsewhere, although that, too, is important. It is rather a question of the degree to which the 
United States can create among the peoples of the world generally the
impression of a country which knows what it wants, which is coping successfully with the problems 
of its internal life and with the responsibilities of a World Power, and which has a spiritual 
vitality capable of holding its own among the major ideological currents of the time. To the extent 
that such an impression can be created and maintained, the aims of Russian Communism must appear 
sterile and quixotic, the hopes and enthusiasm of Mos- cowa€™ s
supporters  must wane, and added strain must be imposed on the Kremlina€™ s foreign policies. For 
the palsied decrepitude of the capitalist world is the keystone of Communist philosophy. Even the 
failure of the United States to experience the early economic depression which the ravens of the 
Red Square have been predicting with such complacent confidence since hostilities ceased would have 
deep and important repercussions throughout the Communist
world.    By the same token, exhibitions of indecision, disunity and internal disintegration within 
this country have an exhilarating effect on the whole Communist movement. At each evidence of these 
tendencies, a thrill of hope and excitement goes through the Communist world; a new jauntiness can 
be noted in the Moscow tread; new groups of foreign supporters climb on to what they can only view 
as the bandwagon of international politics; and Russian
pressure increases all along the line in international affairs.

It would be an exaggeration to say that American behavior unassisted and alone could exercise a 
power of life and death over the Communist movement and bring about the early fall of Soviet power 
in Russia. But the United States has it in its power to increase enormously the strains under which 
Soviet policy must operate, to force upon the Kremlin a far greater degree of moderation and 
circumspection than it has had to observe in recent years, and in this way
to promote tendencies which must eventually find their outlet in either the break-up or the gradual 
mellowing of Soviet power. For no mystical. Messianic movementa€”and particularly not that of the 
Kremlina€”can face frustration indefinitely without eventually adjusting itself in one way or 
another to the logic of that state of affairs.

Thus the decision will really fall in large measure in this country itself. The issue of 
Soviet-American relations is in essence a test of the overall worth of the United States as a 
nation among nations. To avoid destruction the United States need only measure up to its own best 
traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation. Surely, there was never a 
fairer test of national quality than this. In the light of these circumstances, the thoughtful
observer of Russian-American relations will find no cause for complaint in the Kremlina€™ s 
challenge to American society. He will rather experience a certain gratitude to a Providence which, 
by providing the American people with this implacable challenge, has made their entire security as 
a nation dependent on their pulling themselves together and accepting the responsibilities of moral 
and political leadership that history plainly intended them to bear.

Communists at home and abroad, its fortunes promoted, its enemies badgered and confounded.

The promotion of premature, a€ceadventuristica€D revolutionary projects abroad which might 
embarrass Soviet power in any way would be an inexcusable, even a counter-revolutionary act. The 
cause of Socialism is the support and promotion of Soviet power, as defined in Moscow. This brings 
us to the second of the concepts important to contemporary Soviet outlook. That is the 
infallibility of the Kremlin. The Soviet concept of power, which permits no focal
points of organization outside the Party itself, requires that the Party leadership remain in 
theory the sole repository of truth. For if truth were to be found elsewhere, there would be 
justification for its expression in organized activity. But it is precisely that which the Kremlin 
cannot and will not permit. The leadership of the Communist Party is therefore always right, and 
has been always right ever since in 1929 Stalin formalized his personal power by announcing
that decisions of the Politburo were being taken unanimously. On the principle of infallibility 
there rests the iron discipline of the Communist Party. In fact, the two concepts are mutually 
self-supporting. Perfect discipline requires recognition of infallibility. Infallibility requires 
the observance of discipline. And the two together go far to determine the behaviorism of the 
entire Soviet apparatus of power.

But their effect cannot be understood unless a third factor be taken into account: namely, the fact 
that the leadership is at liberty to put forward for tactical purposes any particular thesis which 
it finds useful to the cause at any particular moment and to require the faithful and un- 
questioning acceptance of that thesis by the members of the movement as a whole. This means that 
truth is not a constant but is actually created, for all intents and purposes, by the Soviet
leaders themselves. It may vary from week to week, from month to month. It is nothing absolute and 
immutable a€” nothing which flows from objective reality. It is only the most recent manifestation 
of the wisdom of those in whom the ultimate wisdom is supposed to reside, because they represent 
the logic of history.

The accumulative effect of these factors is to give to the whole subordinate apparatus of Soviet 
power an unshakeable stubbornness and steadfastness in its orientation. This orientation can be 
changed at will by the Kremlin but by no other power. Once a given party line has been laid down on 
a given issue of current policy, the whole Soviet governmental machine, including the mechanism of 
diplomacy, moves inexorably along the prescribed path, like a
persistent toy automobile wound up and headed in a given direction, stopping only when it meets 
with some unanswerable force. The individuals who are the components of this machine are unamenable 
to argument or reason which comes to them from outside sources. Their whole training has taught 
them to mistrust and discount the glib persuasiveness of the outside world. Like the white dog 
before the phonograph, they hear only the a€oemastera€™ s
voice.a€D And if they are to be called off from the purposes last dictated to them, it is the 
master who must call them off.

Thus the foreign representative cannot hope that his words will make any impression on them. The 
most that he can hope is that they will be transmitted to those at the top, who are capable of 
changing the party line. But even those are not likely to be swayed by any normal logic in the 
words of the bourgeois representative. Since there can be no appeal to common purposes, there can 
be no appeal to common mental approaches. For this reason, facts speak louder
than words to the ears of the Kremlin; and words carry the greatest weight when they have the ring 
of reflecting, or being backed up by, facts of unchallengeable validity. But we have seen that the 
Kremlin is under no ideological compulsion to accomplish its purposes in a hurry. Like the Church, 
It is dealing in ideological concepts which are of long-term validity, and it can afford to be 
patient. It has no right to risk the existing achievements of the revolution for
the sake of vain baubles of the future. The very teachings of Lenin himself require great caution 
and flexibility in the pursuit of Communist purposes.

Again, these precepts are fortified by the lessons of Russian history: of centuries of obscure 
battles between nomadic forces over the stretches of a vast unfortified plain. Here caution, 
circumspection, flexibility and deception are the valuable qualities; and their value finds natural 
appreciation in the Russian or the oriental mind. Thus the Kremlin has no compunction about 
retreating in the face of superior force. And being under the compulsion of no timetable, it
does not get panicky under the necessity for such retreat. Its political action is a fluid stream 
which moves constantly, wherever it is permitted to move, toward a given goal. Its main concern is 
to make sure that it has filled every nook and cranny available to it in the basin of world power. 
But if it finds unassailable barriers in its path, it accepts these philosophically and 
accommodates itself to them. The main thing is that there should always be pressure,
unceasing constant pressure, toward the desired goal. There is no trace of any feeling in Soviet 
psychology that that goal must be reached at any given time. These considerations make Soviet 
diplomacy at once easier and more difficult to deal with than the diplomacy of individual 
aggressive leaders like Napoleon and Hitler. On the one hand it is more sensitive to contrary 
force, more ready to yield on individual sectors of the diplomatic front when that force is
felt to be too strong, and thus more rational in the logic and rhetoric of power. On the other hand 
it cannot be easily defeated or discouraged by a single victory on the part of its opponents. And 
the patient persistence by which it is animated means that it can be effectively countered not by 
sporadic acts which represent the momentary whims of democratic opinion but only by intelligent 
long-range policies on the part of Russiaa€™ s adversariesa€’’policies no
less steady in their purpose, and no less variegated and resourceful in their application, than 
those of the Soviet Union itself.

In these circumstances it is clear that the main element of any United States policy toward the 
Soviet Union must be that of a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian 
expansive tendencies. It is important to note, however, that such a policy has nothing to do with 
outward histrionics: with threats or blustering or superfluous gestures of outward a€D toughness." 
While the Kremlin is basically flexible in its reaction to political realities, it is
by                                                                                                  
                                                                                                    
           no means unamenable to considerations of prestige. Like almost any other government, it 
can be placed by tactless and threatening gestures in a position where it cannot afford to yield 
even though this might be dictated by its sense of realism. The Russian leaders are keen judges of 
human psychology, and as such they are highly conscious that loss of temper and of self-control is 
never a source of strength in political affairs. They are quick to exploit such
evidences of weakness. For these reasons, it is a sine qua non of successful dealing with Russia 
that the foreign government in question should remain at all times cool and collected and that its 
demands on Russian policy should be put forward in such a manner as to leave the way open for a 
compliance not too detrimental to Russian prestige.

In the light of the above, it will be clearly seen that the Soviet pressure against the free 
institutions of the western world is something that can be contained by the adroit and vigilant 
application of counter-force at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points, 
corresponding to the shifts and manoeuvres of Soviet policy, but which cannot be charmed or talked 
out of existence. The Russians look forward to a duel of infinite duration, and they see
that already they have scored great successes. It must be borne in mind that there was a time when 
the Communist Party represented far more of a minority in the sphere of Russian national life than 
Soviet power today represents in the world community. But if ideology convinces the rulers of 
Russia that truth is on their side and that they can therefore afford to wait, those of us on whom 
that ideology has no claim are free to examine objectively the validity of
that premise. The Soviet thesis not only implies complete lack of control by the west over its own 
economic destiny, it likewise assumes Russian unity, discipline and patience over an infinite 
period.

Let us bring this apocalyptic vision down to earth, and suppose that the western world finds the 
strength and resourcefulness to contain Soviet power over a period of ten to fifteen years. What 
does that spell for Russia itself? The Soviet leaders, taking advantage of the contributions of 
modern technique to the arts of despotism, have solved the question of obedience within the 
confines of their power. Few challenge their authority; and even those who do are
unable to make that challenge valid as against the organs of suppression of the state. The Kremlin 
has also proved able to accomplish its purpose of building up in Russia, regardless of the 
interests of the inhabitants, an industrial foundation of heavy metallurgy, which is, to be sure, 
not yet complete but which is nevertheless continuing to grow and is approaching those of the other 
major industrial countries.

All of this, however, both the maintenance of internal political security and the building of heavy 
industry, has been carried out at a terrible cost in human life and in human hopes and energies. It 
has necessitated the use of forced labor on a scale unprecedented in modern times under conditions 
of peace. It has involved the neglect or abuse of other phases of Soviet economic life, 
particularly agriculture, consumersa€™ goods production, housing and
transportation. To all that, the war has added its tremendous toll of destruction, death and human 
exhaustion. In consequence of this, we have in Russia today a population which is physically and 
spiritually tired. The mass of the people are disillusioned, skeptical and no longer as accessible 
as they once were to the magical attraction which Soviet power still radiates to its followers 
abroad. The avidity with which people seized upon the slight respite accorded to
the  Church for tactical reasons during the war was eloquent testimony to the fact that their 
capacity for faith and devotion found little expression in the purposes of the regime. In these 
circumstances, there are limits to the physical and nervous strength of people themselves. These 
limits are absolute ones, and are binding even for the crudest dictatorship, because beyond them 
people cannot be driven.

The forced labor camps and the other agencies of constraint provide temporary means of compelling 
people to work longer hours than their own volition or mere economic pressure would dictate; but if 
people survive them at all they become old before their time and must be considered as human 
casualties to the demands of dictatorship. In either case their best powers are no longer available 
to society and can no longer be enlisted in the service of the state.
Here only the younger generation can help. The younger generation, despite all vicissitudes and 
sufferings, is numerous and vigorous; and the Russians are a talented people. But it still re-mains 
to be seen what will be the effects on mature performance of the abnormal emotional strains of 
childhood which Soviet dictatorship created and which were enormously increased by the war. Such 
things as normal security and placidity of home environment have
practically ceased to exist in the Soviet Union outside of the most remote farms and villages. And 
observers are not yet sure whether that is not going to leave its mark on the over-all capacity of 
the generation now coming into maturity.

formidable achievements, has been precariously spotty and uneven. Russian Communists who speak of

pressure increases all along the line in international affairs.

It would be an exaggeration to say that American behavior unassisted and alone could exercise a 
power of life and death over the Communist movement and bring about the early fall of Soviet power 
in Russia. But the United States has it in its power to increase enormously the strains under which 
Soviet policy must operate, to force upon the Kremlin a far greater degree of moderation and 
circumspection than it has had to observe in recent years, and in this way
to promote tendencies which must eventually find their outlet in either the break-up or the gradual 
mellowing of Soviet power. For no mystical. Messianic movementa€”and particularly not that of the 
Kremlina€”can face frustration indefinitely without eventually adjusting itself in one way or 
another to the logic of that state of affairs.

Thus the decision will really fall in large measure in this country itself. The issue of 
Soviet-American relations is in essence a test of the overall worth of the United States as a 
nation among nations. To avoid destruction the United States need only measure up to its own best 
traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation. Surely, there was never a 
fairer test of national quality than this. In the light of these circumstances, the thoughtful
observer of Russian-American relations will find no cause for complaint in the Kremlina€™ s 
challenge to American society. He will rather experience a certain gratitude to a Providence which, 
by providing the American people with this implacable challenge, has made their entire security as 
a nation dependent on their pulling themselves together and accepting the responsibilities of moral 
and political leadership that history plainly intended them to bear.

In Russia there is not even such a thing as local government. The present generation of Russians 
have never known spontaneity of collective action. If, consequently, anything were ever to occur to 
disrupt the unity and efficacy of the Party as a political instrument, Soviet Russia might be 
changed overnight from one of the strongest to one of the weakest and most pitiable of national 
societies. Thus the future of Soviet power may not be by any means as secure as

Russian capacity for self-delusion would make it appear to the men in the Kremlin. That they can 
keep power themselves, they have demonstrated. That they can quietly and easily turn it over to 
others remains to be proved. Meanwhile, the hardships of their rule and the vicissitudes of 
international life have taken a heavy toll of the strength and hopes of the great people on whom 
their power rests.

It is curious to note that the ideological power of Soviet authority is strongest today in areas 
beyond the frontiers of Russia, beyond the reach of its police power. This phenomenon brings to 
mind a comparison used by Thomas Mann m his great novel a€oe Buddenbrooks.a€D Observing that human 
in- institutions often show the greatest outward brilliance at a moment when inner decay is in 
reality farthest advanced, he compared the Buddenbrook family, in the
days of its greatest glamour, to one of those stars whose light shines most brightly on this world 
when in reality it has long since ceased to exist. And who can say with assurance that the strong 
light still cast by the Kremlin on the dissatisfied peoples of the western world is not the 
powerful afterglow of a constellation which is in actuality on the wane? This cannot be proved. And 
it cannot be disproved. But the possibility remains (and in the opinion of this writer
it is a strong one) that Soviet power, like the capitalist world of its conception, bears within it 
the seeds of its own decay, and that the sprouting of these seeds is well advanced.

It is clear that the United States cannot expect in the foreseeable future to enjoy political 
intimacy with the Soviet regime. It must continue to regard the Soviet Union as a rival, not a 
partner, in the political arena. It must continue to expect that Soviet policies will reflect no 
abstract love of peace and stability, no real faith in the possibility of a permanent happy 
coexistence of the Socialist and capitalist worlds, but rather a cautious, persistent pressure 
toward the
disruption and weakening of all rival influence and rival power. Balanced against this are the 
facts that Russia, as opposed to the western world in general, is still by far the weaker party, 
that Soviet policy is highly flexible, and that Soviet society may well contain deficiencies which 
will eventually weaken its own total potential.

This would of itself warrant the United States entering with reasonable confidence upon a policy of 
firm containment, designed to confront the Russians with unalterable counter-force at every point 
where they show signs of encroaching upon the interests of a peaceful and stable world. But in 
actuality the possibilities for American policy are by no means limited to holding the line and 
hoping for the best. It is entirely possible for the United States to influence by
its actions the internal developments, both within Russia and throughout the international 
Communist movement, by which Russian policy is largely determined. This is not only a question of 
the modest measure of informational activity which this government can conduct in the Soviet Union 
and elsewhere, although that, too, is important. It is rather a question of the degree to which the 
United States can create among the peoples of the world generally the
impression of a country which knows what it wants, which is coping successfully with the problems 
of its internal life and with the responsibilities of a World Power, and which has a spiritual 
vitality capable of holding its own among the major ideological currents of the time. To the extent 
that such an impression can be created and maintained, the aims of Russian Communism must appear 
sterile and quixotic, the hopes and enthusiasm of Mos- cowa€™ s
supporters  must wane, and added strain must be imposed on the Kremlina€™ s foreign policies. For 
the palsied decrepitude of the capitalist world is the keystone of Communist philosophy. Even the 
failure of the United States to experience the early economic depression which the ravens of the 
Red Square have been predicting with such complacent confidence since hostilities ceased would have 
deep and important repercussions throughout the Communist
world.    By the same token, exhibitions of indecision, disunity and internal disintegration within 
this country have an exhilarating effect on the whole Communist movement. At each evidence of these 
tendencies, a thrill of hope and excitement goes through the Communist world; a new jauntiness can 
be noted in the Moscow tread; new groups of foreign supporters climb on to what they can only view 
as the bandwagon of international politics; and Russian
pressure increases all along the line in international affairs.

It would be an exaggeration to say that American behavior unassisted and alone could exercise a 
power of life and death over the Communist movement and bring about the early fall of Soviet power 
in Russia. But the United States has it in its power to increase enormously the strains under which 
Soviet policy must operate, to force upon the Kremlin a far greater degree of moderation and 
circumspection than it has had to observe in recent years, and in this way
to promote tendencies which must eventually find their outlet in either the break-up or the gradual 
mellowing of Soviet power. For no mystical. Messianic movementa€”and particularly not that of the 
Kremlina€”can face frustration indefinitely without eventually adjusting itself in one way or 
another to the logic of that state of affairs.

Soviet-American relations is in essence a test of the overall worth of the United States as a 
nation among nations. To avoid destruction the United States need only measure up to its own best 
traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation. Surely, there was never a 
fairer test of national quality than this. In the light of these circumstances, the thoughtful
observer of Russian-American relations will find no cause for complaint in the Kremlina€™ s 
challenge to American society. He will rather experience a certain gratitude to a Providence which,
