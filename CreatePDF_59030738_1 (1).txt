Paragraphs

Left-neoliberalism said that if the economy is properly managed in a Keynesian, Pigovian, and 
Beveridgean modea€”with full employment and stable prices on the one hand, externalities 
compensated for on the second, and wealth distributed not too inequitably so that everyone has some 
and some social powera€”then it was absolutely hunky-dory if the only rights that mattered were 
property rights. Right-neoliberalism said that of course the only rights
that did and should matter were property rights, and the point was to concentrate them in the hands 
of the right people. And the reaction against this two-headed doctrine? We should not be surprised 
that the reaction, and thus the attack against the liberal order that neoliberalism had hollowed 
out, came from the neo-fascist ethno-nationalist right, rather than from the pseudo-socialist left:

Tom Clark: How the Rich Ate Us: a€~The Rise and Fall of the Neoliberal Order: America and the World 
n the Free Market Era by Gary Gerstle; Liberalism and its Discontents by Francis Fukuyamaa€!. P&O 
Ferriesa€! confessed to having breached the obligations of redundancy law, but pleaded that this 
was in the service of an overriding dutya€”to the bottom linea€!. American liberalsa€! in aa€! 
reflective mooda€! are
interrogating the nature of the age wea€™ ve been living througha€!. Francis Fukuyamaa€! the 
wonderfully crisp Liberalism and its Discontents^} the illiberal backlash as provoked by extreme 
offshoots of liberalism, one of them being neoliberalism, which has produced a€oegrotesque 
inequalitiesa€D by hardening the traditional liberal presumption of free exchange to the point 
where a€oethe doctrine becomes, so to speak,
doctrinaire.a€Da€! Gary Gerstlea€! knows what a political order involves: a web of rules, 
institutions, presumptions and people that can survive a change of governmental. What eventually 
crashed the neoliberal order, as Gerstle sees it, was not any progressive challenge, buta€! Donald 
Trump, who rode into Washington on a tide of rants about immigration and global tradea€!. Only with 
a a€oeproperty firsta€D rather than a
a€cefreedom firsta€D reading of neoliberalism can we understand how Mises could hail 1920s fascism 
as a a€cemakeshifta€D salvation for civilisation against the left, and grasp why the ageing Hayek 
would defend the 1970s coup against an elected socialist government in Chile, which brought 
Pinocheta€™ s murderous regime to power. Yes, ideas had an important role in the neoliberal story. 
But ultimately it has been an
instrumental onea€!

Why a€oewe said we would do something stupid, and now that it is clear that it is really stupid we 
really must keep our word and do ita€D gains you the kind of credibility you want to have has 
always been very hard for me to understand:

Paul Krugman: How Low Must Inflation Go?: a€~It looka€! well above 2 percent inflation, which the 
Fed and other central banks have traditionally seen as their target. And the Fed is set to continue 
tightening until that target is hit. So why is 2 percent the target?a€! During Ronald Reagana€™ s 
second term, Americaa€™ s underlying inflation rate was roughly what it is now. Yet policymakers 
were strutting around boasting
about their victory over inflation, and the public didna€™t see inflation as a major concerna€!. If 
we are about to have a recessiona€! it wona€™t be because hard economic considerations require that 
we squeeze inflation all the way back down to 2 percent. What wea€™re seeing instead is monetary 
policy driven by softer, vaguer concerns about credibility. We live in peculiar timesa€!

This I really do not get.

There are only about 500 people in all of Greater Philadelphia who regularly make $5,000,000 or 
more in a year (i.e., who do not occasionally reach that level in a good year). One of the most 
very eminent of Swarthmore professors mighta€”mig^/a€”be able to exact as much social and cultural 
deference as one of those 500, in some circles. But the associate director of an urban non-profit 
making 1/100 as much? Now there is the constant, for the past
2500 years, cry of the old vs. the young: a€oel do not know what Rome is coming to. These days a 
pretty-boy costs more than a sword, and ajar of imported fermented fish sauce more than a farm! O 
temporal O moreslaBO What does Timothy Burke think that this a€oesocial and cultural defere nee a€D 
might possibly be? And how is it exercised and made visible? The $5 million-a-year guys are fine 
with the world, unless they have gotten themselves
trapped in the Fox News grift.

In what alternate universe is the usually very smart Timothy Burke living? (Yes, I know: it is the 
Swarthmore campus.):

Timothy Burke: Academia: Disentanglement: a€~There is an attainment of cultural status that is 
a€oeclass-likea€na€! conferred in part by elite selective higher education. The graduate of an 
elite selective college or university who is making $45,000 as the associate director of an urban 
non-profit may be granted a kind of cultural and social deference that is not shown to the graduate 
of a regional public who owns a car
dealership that makes him $5 million a yeara€!. Ita€! structures a whole range of status markers, 
forms of address, and especially access to the a€oeattention economya€D or to mass media. What 
Adler-Bell and others call a€cewokenessa€D is just a small subset of this kind of sorting. The halo 
effect is both a product of the social networks of these graduates and virtually anything they 
saya€!
