If you want to know why we economists respect them so much and are cheering their Nobel Prizes so loudly, follow the link: <strong>Joshua Angrist, Ryan Avent, David Card, &amp; Rachana Shanbhogue </strong>: <em>A Real-World Revolution in Economics</em>: ‘THIS YEAR’s Nobel prize celebrates the “credibility revolution” that has transformed economics since the 1990s. Today most notable new work is not theoretical but based on analysis of real-world data.... How their work has brought economics closer to real life…&lt;<a href="https://www.economist.com/nobelpod2021?utmcampaign=editorial-social&amp;utmmedium=social-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter">https://www.economist.com/nobelpod2021?utmcampaign=editorial-social&amp;utmmedium=social-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p>This is, I think, the best single thing to read about the Card, Angrist, Imbens Economics Nobel Prize: <strong>Noah Smith</strong>: <em>The Econ Nobel We Were All Waiting for</em>: ‘To predict who will win the Econ Nobel... list the most influential people  in the field who haven’t won it yet.... Assume... micro theorists won’t win... two years in a row.... The ones whose influence is the oldest are the most likely to win.... For years, this method led lots of people—including me—to predict a Nobel for David Card. His 1994 paper with Alan Krueger on the minimum wage was a thunderbolt.... Since then, Card has been at the forefront of empirical labor.... Angrist and Imbens’ impact... though also high... came later.... I wouldn’t have been surprised had they won the prize in later years. But Card was clearly overdue. Perhaps the reason it took this long was that Card’s conclusions in his famous minimum wage paper were so hard for many in the field to swallow.… At the time, Card and Krueger’s finding seemed revolutionary and heretical. In fact, other researchers had probably been finding the same thing, but were afraid to publish their results, simply because of their terror of offending the orthodoxy... </p></li></ul><div
