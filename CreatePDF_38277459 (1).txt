Zach Carter, who was supposed to be our guest this week, has a cold. So we have a grab-bag:

Subject: Blighter Video thread
Keywords: Hexapodia as the key insight
Distribution: Threat of the Blight
Approved:    yes

Date: 8.68 days since Fall of Relay

Key Insights:

• Red states will see a lot of COVID-hurt this summer fall and winter fora€! reasons we still find

• NIMBYism has not killed California growth because monkey-smarts are becoming, relatively, less

•  The right response to those who advocate cutting off UI now is Ezra Kleina€™ s: a€oeMy God! Let

•  Google can be a useful search engine, if only for your own backlist, if you can remember eight 
unusual words you used to write down your thoughts the last time you thought seriously about 
somethinga€!

•  There are too many parallels between Wilhelmine Germany back before World War I and China today 
for us to sleep easy; the best we can hope is that Marx was right when he said that, when history 
repeats, the first time it is tragedy, the second time farcea€!

• Hexapodia!
