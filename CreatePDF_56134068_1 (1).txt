FIRST: History: Goda€™s Eye, Worma€™s Eye, & Intermediate Levels:

Very nicely put by the extremely insightful Dominic Lieven:

Dominic Lieven: The End of Tsarist Russia: The March to World War I & Revolution'. a€~One way to 
impose some ordera€! isa€! levels of analysisa€!.

The Goda€™ s-eye viewa€! one finds only long-term, structural factorsa€! globalization and 
geopolitics, the European balance of power, and the dominant ideologies and valuesa€!.

But it bears remembering that in 1914 war occurred after a diplomatic crisis lasting less than two 
weeks. If the archduke Franz Ferdinand had not been assassinated in June 1914, it is unlikely that 
Europe would have gone to war that year. A war postponed might have been a war avoided. 
Alternatively, a war fought two years later over a different issue mighta€! have ended in German 
victory, thereby radically changing the path of
subsequent European and Russian historya€!.

Although the worm dominates my story most completely as regards July 1914, the crisis that took 
Europe to war cannot be studied on its own. It was the lasta€”and in many ways the producta€”of a 
series of crises and developments that stretched back to 1905 and require the worma€™ s careful 
attention. Between the eye of God and the eye of the worm, there are intermediate levelsa€!. They 
connect the structural factors visible in the
stratosphere and the worms who made the decisions that ended in catastrophe. Obvious 
intermediate-level elements are the systems of governmental the institutionsa€!. How did decision 
makers understand the meanings of power and the nature of international relations?a€! How did they 
envisage a future European war? These questions underpin mucha€! but lurk too far removed from the 
day-to-daya€! for the worma€!. At the
intermediate level, one needs to carefully probe terms such as a€oegreat powera€D and a€oebalance 
of powera€Da€l. Above all, two elements dominated Russian foreign policy before 1914: The first was 
commitment to something called a balance of power. The second was a conception of Russian identity 
and of the Russian peoplea€™ s place in Europe and in history. The poor worm cannot hope to delve 
into such matters as he
pursues his narrativea€!

At the worma€™ s-eye level, history is one damn thing happening after another, and possible 
history's branch and branch and branch, with large and substantial difference between the 
possibilities: a€oea war postponed might have been a war avoided. Alternatively, a war fought two 
years later over a different issue mighta€l have ended in German victorya€la€D

At the Goda€™ s-eye level, history gathers possibilities back into a bundle of likelihood. 
Something like a major industrial war of national military and economic mobilization among the 
great powers in a context of defensive trench-warfare tactical superiority was very likely to 
happen in Europe sometime after 1900, and it was likely to massively destabilize all ancien 
rA©gimes, and to substantially destabilize all others.
And at the intermediate level, there are transmission belts: how the structures influence the 
conceptual universes within which the deciders make their decisions, and then how those decisions 
carry and miscarry as they run up against technological-material-social realities.


This worm-intermediate-God framework overlaps with causally a€cethina€D and a€cethicka€D history in 
ways I do not fully and properuy understand.

The development of Covid vaccines in 2020 is one of the most startling accomplishments in human 
history a€” in the same league as the moon landing or the Manhattan Project. In record time, 
scientists, corporations, and governments responded to the threat of a pandemic in real time by 
developing vaccines before the pandemic was even halfway through. Wide da€!

Everything is rainbows and unicorns while the aggregators are building the market. But then the 
aggregator is a two-sided monopolist, able to squeeze both creators and the audience.
Figure the Emir of classical Samarkand, But without the clan-network attachments to the caravaning 
merchants traveling the Silk Road that kept him from squeezing as hard as he could.

Ben Thompson (2015): Aggregation Theory. a€~The best way to make outsize profits in any of these 
markets is to either gain a horizontal monopoly in one of the three parts or to integrate two of 
the parts such that you have a competitive advantage in delivering a vertical solution. In the 
pre-Internet era the latter depended on controlling distribution^!. The fundamental disruption of 
the Internet has been to turn this dynamic on its
heada€!. The most important factor determining success is the user experience: the best 
distributors/aggregators/market-makers win by providing the best experience, which earns them the 
most consumers/users, which attracts the most suppliers, which enhances the user experience in a 
virtuous cyclea€!. I suspect that nearly every industry will belatedly discover it has a critical 
function that can be digitized and commodified,
precipitating this shift. The profound changes caused by the Internet are only just beginning; 
aggregation theory is the meansa€!

Thirteen live births for Faustina Minora. She died at 45. Only 37% of children survived their 
father:

Technology Trends: Marcus Aurelius: a€~Marriage and Children: Aurelius married his first cousin 
Faustina the Younger in 145. During their 30-year marriage Faustina bore 13 children. Only one son 
and four daughters outlived their father: (1) Annia Aurelia Galeria Faustina (147a€“after 165). (2) 
Gemellus Lucillae (died around 150), twin brother of Lucilla. (3) Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla 
(148/50a€“182), twin sister of Gemellus,

One of the most remarkable things about the 20th century is our extraordinary success in spreading 
life expectancy-increasing public-health and biomedical technology around the globe relative to our 
substantial failure in spreading the technologies of high economic productivity:

Leandro Prados de la Escosura 23: Health, Income, & the Preston Curve: a€~Life expectancy and per 
capita income growth behaved differently in terms of trends and distribution over the period. The 
relationship was particularly weak during the period 1914 to 1950. Separately, medical improvements 
and the diffusion of medical knowledge have been crucial drivers of life expectancy improvements 
across the worlda€!

Noah Smith: The Biden Administration Has Dropped the Ball on Vaccine Development: a€~I was totally 
surprised at how amazingly successful Operation Warp Speed wasa€!. Given the Trump administration^™ 
s incompetence with respect to restoring U.S. manufacturing, and its general attitude of 
belligerence and empty self-aggrandizement, I expected OWS to be a boondoggle. Never have I been 
happier to be proven wronga€!.
Given the supply chain failuresa€! I expected similar holdups in mRNA vaccine productiona€!. Third, 
given the extreme dysfunction of the CDCa€! I expected the FDA to hold up release of even a fully 
safe and effective vaccine for far longer than it dida€!. But it has been over a year since that 
triumph, and in that time, the Biden administration has curiously dropped the ball on vaccine

I being very quiet may help you avoid making some enemies, but it definitely keeps you from making 
any friends:

John Scalzi: An author is telling other authors not to take political positions because our job is 
to entertain, not alienate a€oehalf our readers.a€Ua€! Basically: Nah. Dona€™t shut up, if you 
would prefer to speak. Also, as a human here on Earth in 2022, youa€™re in a bunch of a€celanesa€D 
including a€oea political stakeholder who has opinions on events that affect their life.a€D You may 
decide that a€celanea€D is the important
one right nowa€!. Living a life of never publicly expressing an opinion so as to never lose a sale 
seems enervating and futile to mea€!. Have you noticed that bestselling authors on social media 
tend to be a politically mouthy bunch? Ita€™ s almost as if their having a loud public political 
opinion did not impede their book sales! Curious, that!a€! You could lose readers by expressing 
opinions. You can also gain thema€!. You dona€™t
have to express political or other opinions out loud if thata€™ s not how you roll. Be who you are. 
But that is how you roll, dona€™ t limit yourself because of worries about sales. I suspect you 
will also find being your authentic self is important in the long runa€!. You dona€™ t need to be 
silent against your will, just for the sake of a salea€!

Ah. a€oeUniversal historya€D. a€oeWhat happens when a historian or writer tries to describe the 
history of the world, whether limited to a particular time period or theme or encompassing 
literally everything that has happened to humanity in historical time?a€D The historian must decide 
on and then center an overly simplistic grand narrative. Thus the question becomes: what extent 
must that Grand Narrative then become the historiana€™ s master, and to
what extent can it be made to act as merely a helpful servant?:
