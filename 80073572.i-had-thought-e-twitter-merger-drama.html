They are also concerned by his plans to buy Twitter with a group of foreign investors.</p><p>The discussions are still at an early stage, the people familiar said on condition of anonymity. Officials in the US government and intelligence community are weighing what tools, if any, are available that would allow the federal government to review Musk's ventures.</p><p>One possibility is through the law governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review Musk's deals and operations for national security risks, they said…</p></blockquote><p>First of all: Musk is paying out of his and his investors’ own pocket for a great deal of Ukraine’s battlefield communications. To call someone doing that “increasingly Russia-friendly” is Orwellian to an overwhelming degree. </p><p>Elon also wants peace—as do all non-psychopaths. Elon also does not see a path to peace this or next year that includes a retreat of Muscovite forces to the juridical boundary between Ukraine and Russia—as do nearly everyone not off in some fantasyland. Elon also says what he thinks, immediately, unfiltered, and often what he thinks is based on unreliable information—which has good sides and bad sides (I would not invest in one of his ventures), but it is not a crime, and not cause for a government to attempt to disrupt the operations of his business via transparent and false pretexts. </p><p>Elon is not a threat to the national security of the United States. </p><p>And while you might say that CFIUS has jurisdiction over whether foreigners can have an ownership interest in Starlink, which might someday be seen as a strategic asset, I know of no colorable theory for CFIUS having any jurisdiction whatsoever over the ownership of Twitter.</p><p>Second: “Biden administration officials’“. Not “senior Biden administration officials”. And “people familiar with the matter”. Not “senior officials familiar…” or even “officials familiar…” Do these weasel words have meaning?</p><p>My view is that you have nothing if you cannot say “<em><strong>administration sources</strong></em> report that <em><strong>senior administration officials</strong></em> are <em><strong>advocating</strong></em>”. Those who are not administration sources may well not know what is going on. Mere administration officials—who are not senior do not shape policy. And even senior administration officials do all kinds of scenario planning and discuss all kinds of things: no policy is possible without an advocate.</p><p>And yet the Twitter stock price… reacted, and reacted substantially, and has since stayed down. While before it had been on track to smoothly converge to $54.20 a share come Friday and the closing of the Musk acquisition, it no longer is:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6c02de8-73c5-40fc-944d-c50f8afe53f1_1358x782.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6c02de8-73c5-40fc-944d-c50f8afe53f1_1358x782.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6c02de8-73c5-40fc-944d-c50f8afe53f1_1358x782.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6c02de8-73c5-40fc-944d-c50f8afe53f1_1358x782.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6c02de8-73c5-40fc-944d-c50f8afe53f1_1358x782.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d6c02de8-73c5-40fc-944d-c50f8afe53f1_1358x782.png" width="1358" height="782" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d6c02de8-73c5-40fc-944d-c50f8afe53f1_1358x782.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:782,&quot;width&quot;:1358,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:135409,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6c02de8-73c5-40fc-944d-c50f8afe53f1_1358x782.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6c02de8-73c5-40fc-944d-c50f8afe53f1_1358x782.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6c02de8-73c5-40fc-944d-c50f8afe53f1_1358x782.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6c02de8-73c5-40fc-944d-c50f8afe53f1_1358x782.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>$4.30 a share on the table: profit if the merger goes through as scheduled, and no big long-term loss in the very small probability event that it does not.
