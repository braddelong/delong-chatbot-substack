In the first mode there is chronic over supply of labor at the prevailing wage. In the second mode the labor market is in balance, and in order for employment as a whole to rise firms need to offer higher real wages. In the third mode the labor market is at full employment and even increasing wages will not increase employment in the economy as a whole. The labor market has been in the first mood for so long the employers regard to the second as grossly irrational, and talk about "labor shortage" whenever we get into it. But mode two is not “labor shortage”. Mode three is when you can talk about "labor shortage":</p><blockquote><p><strong>Anne Laurie</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Fruits of Their Labor: The Secret Is Leaking Out</em>: ‘The Wall Street Journal is shocked, shocked—companies that pay competitive wages draw the best, loyalest hires!

Exports to retaliating countries fell by as much as 33%…. As Irwin (1998: 337) points out, there were three possible responses to Smoot-Hawley. The first was not to respond at all, but in the context of the Great Depression that might have involved raising tariffs for purely domestic political reasons. The second was to take Smoot-Hawley as a signal that international cooperation had broken down, and erect tariffs as a result. And the third was to take “direct retaliatory measures against the United States”. Only the last of these possibilities constituted retaliation per se…. At the time, however, there was little doubt in policymakers’ minds that Smoot-Hawley had provoked widespread retaliation…. We provide the first systematic quantitative estimates of the impact of retaliation against Smoot-Hawley…. Having high frequency data allows us to exploit the differential timing of retaliatory measures when estimating the impact of retaliationt… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://voxeu.org/article/ghost-smoot-hawley-tells-why-america-isn-t-too-big-avoid-retaliation">https://voxeu.org/article/ghost-smoot-hawley-tells-why-america-isn-t-too-big-avoid-retaliation</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>I do not know if this is right, but it is certainly interesting. Mitch McConnell enforced party unity on Republican senators starting at the beginning of 2009. Perhaps the moderates among them have finally recognized that it has led them to a very bad place indeed:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Cheryl Rofer</strong>:&nbsp;<em>President Biden Restores Strategy To Politics</em>: ‘President Joe Biden was a senator for 36 years. He has seen horse-trading. He has seen comity with segregationists. He has seen deadlock and filibusters. He has seen bipartisanship. He has seen Newt Gingrich’s power grab. He has seen Mitch McConnell’s obstructionism. He knows how the Senate and the House work… quiet talks and promises, agreement and respect. Some of these things may even be feigned. But feigning respect, for example, is itself a way of showing respect…. The old ways decayed… under Gingrich’s and his successors’ scorched-earth politics. Reporters who grew up since Gingrich do not recognize that other tactics exist. They do not recognize that relationships are built and doubts sowed behind the scenes. They are accustomed to tantrums and sudden shows of power. They do not have the tools to describe the wide array of tactics Biden brings with him…. I think we are beginning to see results of Biden’s tactics. It’s early, but there is a premium on being the first to point things out. Thirty-five House Republicans voted to form a commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the Capitol…. A math-minded person could chart it! 1 yes (Romney in Impeachment #1; next time ten House members+7 Senators; now 35 House members.&nbsp;Paul Ryan, former Republican Speaker of the House, is holding a fundraiser for Adam Kinzinger, one of the 35. That is how to move the Senate too. A few at a time. As one senator moves (Mitt Romney), it becomes easier for others…. Biden is redefining bipartisanship to mean the will of the people…. It’s early, and we are seeing small indicators. Things can still go bad…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.balloon-juice.com/2021/05/21/president-biden-restores-strategy-to-politics/">https://www.balloon-juice.com/2021/05/21/president-biden-restores-strategy-to-politics/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Does Schumer mean it when he says “failure is not an option”? Do Manchin and Sinema agree? Certainly they are willing to pretend that they believe that failure is not an option while Schumer negotiates. But will they need to make the jump in the end, and if they need to, will they?</p><blockquote><p><strong>John Stoehr</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Nearly Everyone Missed Chuck Schumer Implying This Week that the Filibuster’s Death Is Coming</em>: ‘Something triggered the prevailing discourse…. Perhaps it was the GOP doing the most unbecoming thing of all in Washington: sticking with the loser. Whatever the reason, this week’s punditry seems to finally recognize the nightmare for what it is…. There are many examples of the conventional wisdom in Washington getting triggered now for some reason instead of, I dunno, after an attempted coup d’etat. All of them, however, focus on the United States Senate, especially Joe Manchin…. Even as I was writing the piece, something was happening to give us even more hope…. Nearly everyone missed it…. Schumer said what he’s been saying for months, which is the filibuster is not going to get in the way of democracy, because democracy is too important. Here’s the quote…. “These kinds of things just are abhorrent to our democracy and we must change them, and we will… failure is not an option and everything will be on the table…” When not if. The question, therefore, is timing. And timing is going to be determined primarily by how the Republicans are willing to behave…. Are the Republicans going to act less fascist than they have been since January 6? If the answer is yes, then the Democrats are in a pickle. They won’t feel the pressure necessary for enacting sweeping democracy reforms. If the answer is no, then… they are going to need the conventional wisdom in Washington to be on their side, which is to say, conventional wisdom saying that it’s OK to act nakedly partisan. I think this past week saw the beginning of that process…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://stoehr.substack.com/p/nearly-everyone-missed-chuck-schumer">https://stoehr.substack.com/p/nearly-everyone-missed-chuck-schumer</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Hunkering down like cowards in your trenches, whimpering and crying, and hoping Trump dies soon is neither a dignified nor a smart strategy.
