<p></p><p>James Madison was not enthusiastic about a <em>democracy:</em></p><blockquote><p>A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority... communication and concert result from the form of government itself... nothing... check[s] the... sacrifice [of] the weaker party or an obnoxious individual... democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention... incompatible with personal security or the rights of property... as short in their lives as... volent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians... have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would... be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions…</p></blockquote><p>James Madison was enthusiastic about a <em>republic.</em> </p><p>The people who counted were to choose a small, select group of representatives who had their values and well-being at heart—but not their passions or their interests. The representatives would then govern subject the procedural checks-and-balances that produced the complex 18th-century orrery that is still the government of the United States. And, remember, a state could restrict the franchise as much as it wished—as long as it preserved “a republican form of government.”</p><p>James Madison's suspicions were widely shared. In Britain on the eve of World War I less than half of adult males could vote. In Germany the legislature in dominant state of Prussia gave a third of votes to those who held the top third of the national wealth. And the United States of America did not attain universal suffrage until—well, until the late 1960s, after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. And even then, Republican political operative William Rehnquist’s “ballot security” efforts in Arizona were valued enough by Republican Richard Nixon to name him an assistant attorney general, and his services as assistant attorney general were valued enough for Richard Nixon to appoint him to the Supreme Court. And his services as justice were valued enough by Ronald Reagan to appoint him Chief Justice. </p><p>One person-one vote had not by 1914 (and has not today) become an uncontested value.</p><p>Nevertheless, the principle of universal suffrage as the touchstone of political legitimacy did make deliberate but massive strides forward in the years up to World War I. But political democracy with an ever-increasing one man-one vote electorate was advancing not because it had many enthusiastic supporters but rather because it was the best, or perhaps the least-bad, of politically-attainable options.</p><p>The socialist fringe and near-fringe on the left wanted more than one person-one vote. They sought the abolition of private property and the rational distribution of the social division of labor… well, by it was not clear what. But that position was rejected by the bulk of political society. However, it was only a fringe that held that that the government should have a totalizing role—that all questions should be settled and all social life organized by a government in which one counted for one. Thus full leveling and full “socialism”—whatever that might turn out to mean—were simply not on the agenda. </p><p>The right held the view that existing inequalities of wealth, influence, and political were just and holy. There were, however, divisions on the right. Some held that inequalities driven by inherited unequal ownership of land and inherited marks of status were holy and just: they tended to view inequalities emerging from the creative destruction and accumulation of the market with, at best, suspicion. </p><p>Others, however, viewed those same inherited and status inequalities with suspicion: the inequalities that were just, this other fraction tended to argue, were social-darwinist inequalities of wealth that showed that some had demonstrated greater fitness in an economic struggle for advantage if not survival. Only a part of the right held that that the government should play no role in limiting or curbing inequalities that arose out of inheritance and the market, but should step back. Within the right, some were eager for the government to break up inherited wealth. Within the right, others were eager for the government to curb entrepreneurial wealth.</p><p>Thus it became accepted by the middle of the political spectrum that economic society would be primarily a market economy in which wealth was unequally distributed due to effort, skill, luck and choosing the right parents and in which wealth counted. But it also became accepted that wealth should not count for everything.</p><p>Thus the political principle that caused the least offense to the greatest number was that political society would be a realm in which each (male) individual’s preferences counted equally in choosing the government, and that the government would then curb and control the economy in order to limit the influence of those whom Republican President Theodore Roosevelt called the “malefactors of great wealth”—without limiting the property of or unduly raising the taxes on those who regarded themselves as hard-working ordinary people..</p><p>Thus over time the range of those who could vote, and the importance of the decisions controlled by those whom the electorate voted for, crept forward. </p><p>France was in one respect the leader. It first saw universal male suffrage in 1792—although effective suffrage of any kind was gone by the coronation of Napoleon in 1804, and did not return, save for a brief interval 1848-1851, until 1871. France was in other respects a great laggard: female suffrage did not arrive in France until the expulsion of the Vichy Nazi collaborationist regime in 1944. The first European land to offer universal suffrage was Finland in 1906, when it was the Grand Duchy of Finland in a personal union with Russia, with the Czar of Russia as its Grand Duke.</p><p>New Zealand has a somewhat better claim to be the leader in one person-one vote. Universal suffrage came to New Zealand in 1893. But even though women could vote you could not vote for women until they were granted eligibility to serve in New Zealand’s parliament in 1919. And, beforehand, all Maori males over 21 could vote in New Zealand from 1867—but only European-descended males who had property could vote until 1879.</p><p>In Great Britain universal manhood suffrage came in 1918, when the suffrage was extended to all men and to women over 30. Adult women under 30 had to wait until 1928. 1928 thus saw the culmination of the long process that started in 1832 with the passage of the first Reform Act.</p><p>That Great Reform Act nearly doubled the electorate from one in ten to one in five adult males, and eliminated such interesting electoral districts as Old Sarum. Old Sarum had no permanent-resident voters—the local landlord, the Earl of Caledon, chose the&nbsp; renters of the five houses whose tenants had the right to vote. He had paid £60,000 pounds for this “rotten borough” in 1802 when he bought it from the Pitt family. </p><p>The 1867 Reform Act doubled the number of voters yet again; 1872 saw the secret ballot; 1883 imposed campaign spending limits; 1884 expanded the electorate to 3/5 of adult males; 1885 shifted parliamentary district boundaries in the direction of one man-one vote; and the Parliament Act of 1911 removed the power of the British House of Lords to do more than delay legislation—all before the Fourth Reform Act of 1918 which enfranchised all men over 21 and all women over 30 who owned or were married to men who owned property.</p><p>These expansions of the franchise mattered a lot. The 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws which put high tariffs on food imports is impossible to envision without Britain’s First Reform Act. In 1870 it was regarded as a bold leap when Britain established free universal public schools for children under ten. The rationale was that of Robert Lowe, First Viscount Sherbrooke and a member of Lord Palmerston’s cabinet. The effect of the Reform Act of 1867 had been, he said, to make the richer segment of the working class the masters of the government, and “we must educate our masters”—not that he liked the Reform Bill especially:</p><blockquote><p>This principle of [political and electoral] equality which you have taken to worship is a very jealous power; she cannot be worshipped by halves, and like the Turk in this respect she brooks no rival near the throne. When you get a democratic basis for your institutions, you must remember that you cannot look at that alone but you must look at it in reference to all your other institutions. When you have once taught the people to entertain the notion of the individual rights of every citizen to share in the Government, and the doctrine of popular supremacy, you impose on yourselves the task of re-modelling the whole of your institutions in reference to the principles that you have set up…. You must take education up the very first question, and you must press it on without delay for the peace of the country…</p></blockquote><p>Once the people—the adult, male, white people that is—had the vote, what were they going to do with it?</p><p>The coming of (male) democracy in the North Atlantic was all mixed up with the coming of modern industry—the move out of agriculture and into industrial and service occupations—the coming of the modern city (the move from the farm to someplace more densely populated), and the coming of heightened within-nation income inequality.</p><p>America in 1776 was, if you were a native-born adult white male, a remarkably egalitarian country. The richest one percent of households owned perhaps ﬁfteen percent of the total wealth in the economy—including the “human wealth” of their slaves in their share of property, but not in the aggregate wealth total. (After all, a slave is valuable property to the slaveowner—but equally or rather more so unproperty, antiproperty, negative property to the slave: a slave society can easily have a minority owning more than 100% of the national wealth once this is taken into account.) A top one percent owning only some fifteen percent of wealth is a very low value for such a statistic: the United States today is somewhere north of 40% of wealth owned by the richest one percent of households.</p><p>Inequality among white males at least did not grow that much as America’s north began to industrialize in the years up through the Civil War—and the Emancipation Proclamation and the thirteenth amendment gave a substantial equalizing push to the economy. In the aftermath of the Civil War the top one percent of households appear to have held perhaps a quarter of the wealth of the country. By 1900, however, the United States was as unequal an economy in relative terms as—well, as it is today. The United States had become the Gilded Age country of industrial princes and immigrants living in tenements of our political memory. </p><p>On the one hand, Andrew Carnegie built the largest mansion in Newport, Rhode Island with gold water faucets. On the other hand, 146 largely-immigrant workers died in the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory ﬁre in Manhattan because the exits had been locked to keep workers from taking fabric out of the building in order to make their own clothes. Surveys and guesses suggest that in the first decade of the twentieth century the richest one percent of U.S. households held something like half percent of national wealth. Attempts to count the wealth of the merchant princes themselves reinforce the suspicion that the pre-World War I U.S. was more unequal than at any time before or since. John D. Rockefeller was some four times richer relative to the wages of the average American of his day than Elon Musk claims to be today. And Rockefeller’s enterprise paid dividends out of operating earnings. (Do not forget: Rockefeller was some ten times richer relative to the total size of the U.S. economy.)</p><p>This country of immigrants and plutocrats was very different from a country of yeoman farmers (among, once again, native-born adult white guys: all the stuff about Americans pulling together to raise each others’ barns and respect each others’ claims ignore the fact that the first rule of property law was that no claim by a Mexican or an Amerindian need be respected—if they were, then the heir of Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo would be in the same position in California today that His Grace Gerald Grosvener, 6th Duke of Westminster is in Britain today.) For at its beginning the United States had been a land of yeoman farmers in its Founding Fathers’ imaginations, and in large part in reality.</p><p>How would things change when the society ceased to be one with a prosperous working and a broad middle class, and an elite made up of hard-working lawyers and merchants on the one hand and a few plutocratic slaveholders on the other? How would things work when the inheritors of land or resources or capital lorded it over everybody else—and bought politicians for small change? Alexis de Tocqueville, a keen-eyed commentator on American society in the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century and author of <em>Democracy in America</em>, had feared the growth of such a class of plutocrats, such an “aristocracy of manufacturers”:</p><blockquote><p>The territorial aristocracy of past ages was obliged by law, or thought itself obliged by custom, to come to the help of its servants and relieve their distress. But the industrial aristocracy of our day, when it has impoverished and brutalized the men it uses, abandons them in time of crisis to public charity to feed them.... Between workman and master there are frequent relations but no true association. I think that, generally speaking, the manufacturing aristocracy which we see rising before our eyes is one of the hardest that have appeared on the earth...</p></blockquote><p>In the United States the rising concentration of wealth during the pre-World War I era provoked a widespread feeling that something, somewhere had gone wrong with the country's development. Abraham Lincoln had thought he lived, and for the most part had lived, in an America in which:</p><blockquote><p>the prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him…</p></blockquote><p>Since the outcome in Lincoln’s day was a largely middle-class society, Lincoln and his era:</p><blockquote><p>[took] it that it is best for all to leave each man free to acquire property as fast as he can. Some will get wealthy. I don’t believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm than good. So while we do not propose any war on capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else…</p></blockquote><p>As historian Ray Ginger writes:</p><blockquote><p>Lincoln… stood for an open society in which all men would have an equal chance…. “I am a living witness,” he told a regiment of soldiers, “that any one of your children may look to come here as my father’s child has.”… From the Civil War to 1900, Abraham Lincoln dominated the visions of the good society which were being projected to exonerate the successful and to inspire the young…. But during those very decades… the social realities that had shaped the Lincoln ideal were being chipped away…</p></blockquote><p>And he quotes a Chicago laborer:</p><blockquote><p>“Land of opportunity,” you say. You know well my children will be where I am—that is, if I can keep them out of the gutter…</p></blockquote><p>Many of the prosperous (and many of the native-born not-so-prosperous) blamed foreigners for what was going wrong with America in the late nineteenth century: aliens born in China, Japan, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Russia who were incapable of speaking English, or understanding American values, or contributing to American society. And were probably genetically feeble-minded too, with children incapable of ever becoming smart and well-educated enough to be full partners in American civilization—especially the Chinese and the Jews. Don’t laugh—that’s what they argued, and that was one reason that if you were French or British you had an easy time fleeing Europe for America in the late 1930s on the eve of World War II, but the gates were in all likelihood shut against you if you were Russo- or Polish- or even German-Jewish.</p><p>Many of the middle class, especially the farmers, blamed the rich, the easterners, and the bankers for what was going wrong with late nineteenth-century America. The Populists of the 1890s blamed the eastern bankers and the gold standard. The Progressives sought reforms to try to diminish the power of what they saw as a wealthy-would be aristocracy: the “malefactors of great wealth” in Theodore Roosevelt’s words. But the Populists and the Progressives remained minority political currents in America until the coming of the Great Depression.&nbsp; In the meantime, the voters continued to narrowly elect Republican presidents—or that triangulating bastard Grover Cleveland—who were more-or-less satisfied with American economic and social developments, and who believed that “the business of America is business.”</p><p>The Democrats who sought a more equal distribution of income and more action by the government to put its thumb on the scales of the market in the interest of greater equality failed to wield political power even though they had a solid lock on the votes of the south after the disenfranchisement of the 1870s and a pretty solid lock on the votes of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. The populist and progressive eras failed to make much of an impact on American policy before World War I—but the availability of the Populist and Progressive agendas made the shift in American politics in response to the Great Depression a generation later rapid and substantial. Every left-of-center initiative that had been proposed between 1885 and 1914 was dusted off and given a try in Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal.</p>
