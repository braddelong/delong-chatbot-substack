As you say, on the eve of WW Angell argued that war was stupid and that everyone would lose. He sensed a big war in the air and was writing to try to stop it. I think, though, that he had a pretty good sense of what he was up against. He quotes one warmonger after another, many in positions of great power, and tries to expose the weaknesses in their arguments. He does such a great job of this, at least for a modern reader, that I almost quite on his book recently because it seemed like he belaboured his argument to the point of tedium: Conquest is counterproductive. Economic progress is available through peaceful cooperation. He makes the argument standing on one leg, standing on his head, hanging from a tree branch, etc.</p><p>But why the overkill?</p><p>I think the answer lies in the fact that he saw scores of influential people all around him still in thrall to the Great Illusion. That is, he was fighting a desperate uphill battle. Itâ€™s true that at times he does seem succumb to an optimistic view that people will finally get it. I think that this is the origin of the stain permanently affixed to Angellâ€™s reputation claiming that he predicted the impossibility of future war right before WWI broke out. You donâ€™t quite say this but I think that your interpretation tends in this direction.</p><p>Itâ€™s also true that for people trained in a rational choice tradition, as we certainly were in economics, itâ€™s a small step to say that people will avoid doing something that will harm them. In this vein, hereâ€™s a prediction that Putin wonâ€™t invade Ukraine because doing so would be a boneheaded move:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Barbara F Walter</strong>: "When I game out Putinâ€™s strategy on Ukraine it always ends with continued brinksmanship, no war. He gets to feed nationalism at home and use the threat of war to bargain abroad. Invasion and a costly occupation leaves him much worse off and Putin knows thisâ€¦</p></blockquote><p>And it was a boneheaded move - that part was right. But, sadly, he did it anyway.</p><p>My point is simply that we should distinguish between:</p><ol><li><p>an argument that starting a war would be stupid, and</p></li><li><p>an argument that war is impossible.</p></li></ol><p>Angell occasionally slipped from 1 to 2 but, broadly, I think that he saw the danger of a big war and made a cogent case to prevent it, albeit to no avail (so, yes, itâ€™s the saddest book on your shelf).</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/Michael_Spagat/status/1571849331367460871&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;1.
