Yet at the same time Frank was writing, Isaiah Berlin was undertaking one of his expeditions into the intellectual milieu of Saint Petersburg in the 1800s, and finding there what we now recognize as what we now see revived as Trumpism:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Isaiah Berlin</strong> (1990): <em>Joseph de Maistre &amp; the Origins of Fascism</em>: ‘This is… a genuine conviction… that men can only be saved by being hemmed in by the terror of authority…. Their appointed masters must do the duty laid upon them by their maker (who has made nature a hierarchical order) by the ruthless imposition of the rules—not sparing themselves—and equally ruthless extermination of the enemy. And who is the enemy? All those who throw dust in the eyes of the people or seek to subvert the appointed order. Maistre calls them “<em>la secte</em>.” They are the disturbers and subverters. To the Protestants and Jansenists he now adds deists and atheists, Freemasons and scientists, democrats, Jacobins, liberals, utilitarians, anticlericals, egalitarians, perfectibilians, materialists, idealists, lawyers, journalists, secular reformers, and intellectuals of every breed; all those who appeal to abstract principles, who put faith in individual reason or the individual conscience; believers in individual liberty or the rational organization of society, reformers and revolutionaries…. This is a catalog of which we have since heard a good deal. It assembles for the first time, and with precision, the list of the enemies of the great counterrevolutionary movement that culminated in fascism…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1990/09/27/joseph-de-maistre-and-the-origins-of-fascism/">https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1990/09/27/joseph-de-maistre-and-the-origins-of-fascism/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>The lesson that personal authority is necessary—that, as Karl Polanyi wrote at the end of The Great Transformation—fascists believe that individual freedom must be surrendered to obedience to the will of the leader if humans are to live successfully in society—is, indeed, the basic fascist lesson. People must, in Polanyi’s words, “resign [themselves] to relinquishing freedom and glorif[y the] power which is the reality of society”, just as a single stick that claims to be free is soon broken, while if it loses its freedom in a stick-bundle tied with leather thongs it becomes a mighty force in the hand of its wielder. Mussolini took this to be the lesson from the power he saw in ethno-nationalism during World War I.</p><p>But there are other liberal and anti-liberal currents.</p><p>Lenin suffered from the infantile mental disorder.of believing that upon the removal of the market the oppressive state would also wither away, and all would be very simple and easy, for "accounting and control necessary... have been simplified by capitalists to the utmost and reduced to the extraordinarily simple operations—which any literate person can perform—of supervising and recording, knowledge of the four rules of arithmetic, and issuing appropriate receipts." </p><p>What a maroon!!</p><p>Keynes thought the problem could be finessed with an extremely light-handed amount of central planning: full-employment policy, and the euthanization of the rentier class by the low-interest rates need to implement full-employment policy, would do enough of the job to make the economic problem cease being a bigger deal than the problem of the continued survival of Disco.</p><p>Polanyi himself called for a kind of “socialism”. But what kind? He wrote: “acceptance of the reality of society gives man indomitable courage and strength....

Glenn Hubbard: <em>The Wall and the Bridge</em></h2><p>The real sea-change came in 1870, with the coming of what Simon Kusnetz &lt;<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1971/kuznets/lecture/">https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1971/kuznets/lecture/</a>&gt; labeled: Modern Economic Growth. Since then, humanity’s global deployed-and-diffused technological capabilities have roughly doubled every 35 years or so, revolutionizing the economy each and every generation, and then re-revolutionizing it again in the next generation. Technological progress, the market economy, and modern capitalism brought extraordinarily efficient new ways of making old and new things. But if your life was centered around making old things in the old way? Well, it was for good reason that Joseph Schumpeter called modern capitalism “the perennial gale of creative destruction” &lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.262276">https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.262276</a>&gt;. And the technological forces driving the “destruction“ part were amplified because in a market society the only rights that it recognizes are property rights, and only some property rights turn out to be valuable. People believe they ought to have many more and very different rights than those conferred by ownership of valuable property. People are not happy to be told that they should say: “the market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the market.”</p><p>Now comes highly intelligent and thoughtful ex-right neoliberal economist <strong>Glenn Hubbard</strong> and his book <em>The Wall &amp; the Bridge</em> &lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wall-Bridge-Fear-Opportunity-Disruptions/dp/0300259085/">https://www.amazon.com/Wall-Bridge-Fear-Opportunity-Disruptions/dp/0300259085/</a>&gt;, to reflect on what has happened to the American economy over his career, since he started studying economics back in 1977. He closes with a vision of a very important and much better road not taken:</p><blockquote><p>Since September 1977… technological change and globalization have magnified the market value of my skills and… [other] professionals. Meanwhile, the closure of Youngstown’s integrated steel mills did not lead to moon-shot efforts toward the preparation and reconnection of many workers and communities…. Imagine if bold support for community colleges and training would match the preparation and reconnection of the G.I. Bill as America was encouraging global integration… bridge ideas…  economic participation…. that generates an ever-increasing wealth of the nation. </p><p>Imagine mass flourishing.</p></blockquote><p>I read this closing. I flash back not to 1977, but to 16 years later, 1993. I am in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. the voice I hear is not Glenn Hubbards but instead the voice of Bob Reich &lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Reich">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Reich</a>&gt;, Bill Clinton’s then-Labor Secretary. Benefits of technology and globalization, the risks to those who might be left behind, the urgency of action to build not walls, to protect industries and occupations that the creative destruction of modern capitalism is rendering unproductive, but instead bridges, to true human flourishing in the 21st century—all that was in there. Plus there was a Vice President, Al Gore, keenly interested in taking the initiative to spend federal money to create the backbone of what became the Internet of the 1990s &lt;<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/25986/history-us-al-gore-really-did-take-initiative-creating-internet">https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/25986/history-us-al-gore-really-did-take-initiative-creating-internet</a>&gt;, the ultimate bridge to mass flourishing in the 21st century.</p><p>Bob Reich was then, in a sense, the leader of the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party. In those days I, working at the Treasury, was in the Bob Rubin wing—the left-neoliberal wing—of the Democratic Party. “Yes”, we said to Bob. “You are right. But not now. American voters are angry. We need to curb the deficit, raise taxes on the rich, put the budget deficit on a glide-path toward zero, and generate a high-investment high-productivity growth recovery. So this year Reconciliation. Next year NAFTA. These left-neoliberal priorities must be our immediate priorities. Then we can turn to bridge building,  and to social democracy.</p><p>It might be that if you could look Bob Reich’s bare back you might you might  scars from the treads of our vehicles as we rolled over him in the Clinton administration policy debates. The Clinton administration turn to social democracy, bridge building, and mass human flourishing never happened. We could have taken that road. But Newt Gingrich led Republicans to legislative victories, and blocked it. Gingrich then embarked on the journey that now has him auditioning for the role of the Pierre Laval of American politics. Gingrich was bad news then. And he is bad news now</p><p>We would very much have liked to have had Glenn Hubbard on our side in the political economy debates of the 1990s.</p><p>Thus when Glenn Hubbard writes “we economists have let the public debate drift to the opposite extremes of building walls and a laissez-faire optimism about change and markets making everything OK”, my immediate reaction is that of Tonto to the Lone Ranger in the old joke: “what is this ‘we’, kemosabe?'“ When he talks about how “T[rade ]A[djustment A[ssistance] came up as a policy topic only when new trade expansions were sought—it received little sustained attention or interest in its augmentation [otherwise]”, he is talking about the Republican Party debate he participated in, rather than the one I have participated in.</p><p>But “Glenn, you are late to the party!” is not a review but rather a self-indulgent whine. The big question is: What refreshments does he bring? The answer is that he brings a lot, and that they are tasty indeed.</p><p>I really wish that I had had this book in my hands six months ago, before my forthcoming <em>Slouching Towards Utopia: The Economic History of the Long 20th Century, 1870-2010</em> &lt;<a href="https://t.co/bRKJD7ruJy">https://bit.ly/3pP3Krk</a>&gt; was set in type. I can count at least five pages that I would have been able to completely rewrite for the better had I had Glenn’s book at my fingertips as I undertook final revisions. Indeed, the intellectual landmarks he principally references are the same as mine: Polanyi, von Hayek, Keynes. </p><p>I think Glenn has it right. Populists build walls. But what we need are bridges:</p><blockquote><p>The antidote or counterargument to a wall is a bridge. Bridges prepare individuals for, and reconnect them to, participation in a dynamic economy. In an economic sense, they are required for mass flourishing. Politically and socially, we need bridges in order to regain public support for the economic system…. Economics offers the blueprints for bridges to prepare individuals for the market system, reconnect them to it, and build support for it. </p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
