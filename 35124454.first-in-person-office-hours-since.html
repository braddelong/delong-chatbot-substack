Republican tax cuts are usually concentrated on high-income individuals, and are justified with the claim that cutting marginal tax rates will lead to an explosion in individual effort, entrepreneurship, and so on…. There have been many debunkings…. The rationale for the corporate tax cut was, however, quite different. It wasn’t about individual work effort; instead, it was about incentives to invest in the United States as opposed to other nations. That’s clearly a real issue in a world of mobile capital…. I accepted this logic, at least as a qualitative matter. I still thought the tax cut was a bad idea, but that was because I believed that the inflow of capital would be smaller and take much longer than the plan’s advocates claimed, and as a result wouldn’t be enough to compensate for the loss of revenue. But I was, it turned out, being too generous. As a 2019 analysis by the International Monetary Fund found, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ended up having no visible effect at all on business investment…. How can we understand this abject failure? I see three reasons, one of which I missed completely back in 2017, two of which I knew about but didn’t give sufficient weight…. The corporate profits tax isn’t a tax on capital, it’s a tax on a particular aspect of corporate financial structure. Analyses—mine included!—that treat it simply as raising the cost of capital are being far too generous to tax cutters. Business investment isn’t that sensitive to the cost of capital, anyway…. Most business assets are fairly short-lived…. And demand for short-lived assets isn’t very sensitive to the cost of capital. [It’s] the demand for houses [that] depends hugely on the interest rate borrowers have to pay…. Monopoly: Financial industry types often talk about the FAANGs: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google — tech companies that loom large in the stock market. These companies look very different from past market leaders like General Motors in its heyday; it’s much harder to link their value to the tangible assets they own…. The profit tax is at this point largely a tax on monopoly or quasi-monopoly profits…. Naïve calculations of the effect of tax cuts on business investment have to be “geared down”…. But why did anyone ever believe that corporate tax cuts would do great things for the economy? The big argument for cutting corporate taxes has long been that if we don’t, corporations will move capital and jobs to lower-tax nations…. What we’ve learned over the past 7 or 8 years, however, is that we’re mainly looking at accounting tricks rather than real capital flight…. The Trump tax cut is that it didn’t reverse capital flight because the capital flight never happened in the first place…. The U.S. government gave up hundreds of billions of dollars to fix a nonexistent problem. Now the Biden administration wants to go after the real problem, which was always tax avoidance, not loss of jobs to foreigners. Will they manage to pass the necessary legislation? We’ll just have to wait and see.&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/opinion/trump-corporate-tax-reform.html?referringSource=articleShare">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/opinion/trump-corporate-tax-reform.html?referringSource=articleShare</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Adam Engst</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Stanford Research Explains &amp; Helps Prevent Zoom Fatigue</em>: ‘Jeremy Bailenson of the Stanford Virtual Human Interaction Lab…. 1. Close-up eye contact is intense…. 2. Looking at yourself is stressful…. 3. Sitting still is hard…. 4. Video chats have a high cognitive load. Videoconferencing encourages all sorts of odd behaviors that require some level of active thought… keeping yourself framed… using a thumbs-up to indicate silent approval… trying to interpret everyone else’s reactions….

He did a bit more of the latter later, but… 4) A lesson from the last guy is just flood the zone with an infinite amount of stuff. Stick 50 good things in the bill and they’ll only have time to get mad about 2 of them.
