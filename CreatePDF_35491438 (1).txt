FIRST:

It is elementary geopolitics that if you think you are a rising power, you soft-pedal it. You take 
every opportunity to defuse conflict and to diminish potential flashpoints. Time is,
after all on your side. The most that you do is point out the incompetence and failures of the 
declining powers, and suggest that those are very likely to continue. Thus you do not
have to risk conflict in order to increase your influence. Influence flows to you from others who 
take note of the rising sun and adapt to it. But China seems to be behaving
differentlya€”as though assertions of national strength and power are essential moves in some 
domestic-policy stabilization task?

Bill Bishop: Xia€™ s New World Order for the New Era: a€~That increasingly seems to be Xi 
Jinpinga€™ s goal, couched amidst calls to a€oeto
safeguard the UN-centered international system, preserve the international order underpinned by 
international lawa€D. Xia€™ s speecha€! at the Boao
Forum  for Asia Annual Conference 202la€!. Xi and his CCP clearly see massive opportunities from 
the carnage of the pandemic and the multiple strategic
disasters of US domestic and foreign policy to change fundamentally the substance of the world 
order while keeping the edifice in place. And their odds of
succeeding look higher than the foreign policy elite in America and its allies would like to admit. 
Is there a a€oeMinsky Momenta€D concept for
geopolitics?    It is starting to look like Xi and his team think there is, or are at least willing 
to gamble on onea€!

Love Liman: Hedge Funda€™ s Collapse in Sweden Puts Spotlight Back on Quants: a€~IPM shuts its 
doors after losing $4 billion in the pandemic. More hedge funds closed than
opened in last six yearsa€!. Lars Ericsson, the chairman of soon-to-be defunct Informed Portfolio 
Management, says ita€™ s clear now that the quantitative strategies his fund used
failed to cope with the market moves brought on by the pandemic. But he rejects the idea that 
quants have had their day. a€oeThere is definitely a future for quantitative hedge
funds,a€D he said on Thursday. IPM, a systematic macro fund based in Stockholm, started bleeding 
client money more than a year ago, with about $4 billion in assets under
management flowing out since late 2019. Ericsson says the funda€™ s medium-term models failed to 
cope with the shock that hit markets in early 2020a€!. IPMa€! managed to
come    back from the brink, but bad trades that predated the pandemic came back to haunt the fund. 
Its relative equity models had been weighing on performance for years, partly due
to  a strategy relying on value stocksa€!. Ericsson says he still thinks everything would have 
worked out had IPM had a little longera€!. More hedge funds have closed than started
in the last six years, with 770 of them shuttering in 2020, according to data compiled by Hedge 
Fund Research Inca€!

Ezra Klein & Tressie Mcmillan Cottom: The Conversation Has Never Been Wider: a€~EZRA KLEIN: Well, 
Ia€™ m always asking for us to bring back blogginga€!. TRESSIE
MCMILLAN COTTOM: Hmm. OK. So I now work with a lot of internet people. Ia€™ m in an information 
school at a university. And so a lot of my very good friends are those
people, so I want to tiptoe carefully. I do think that there was a clubbiness and a camaraderie, 
even among people who politically disagreed. There was a class of thinkers, a class of
writers who came up in that web 2.0 that does feel like, yeah, we lost something there. There was a 
humanity there for good or for bada€!. Therea€™ s a reason they had chosen to
be in that space before it all became about chasing an audience in a platform and turning that into 
influencer and translating that intoa€!. And thata€™ s what I think wea€™re
missing when we become nostalgic for that web 2.0.1 think ita€™ s the people in the machine. Having 
said that, I am very resistant to nostalgia as a thing because usually what we
are nostalgic for is a time that just was not that great for a lot of peoplea€!. EZRA KLEIN: But I 
think youa€™ re right about that criticism of it, too. Something that, for all that I
can tip into nostalgia, something that I think is often missed in todaya€™ s conversation is the 
conversation has never been wider. TRESSIE MCMILLAN COTTOM: Yes. EZRA
KLEIN: People talk all about things they cana€™ t say, but it has never been wider. TRESSIE 
MCMILLAN COTTOM: Yup. EZRA KLEIN: Therea€™ s never been a larger
allowable space of things you could say. TRESSIE MCMILLAN COTTOM: Thata€™ s right. EZRA KLEIN: And 
people have also never been more pissed about how it feels to
participate in it. I dona€™ t want to say never, but broadly, there is an intensity to that 
conversation that is distinct, and I dona€™ t think those things are unrelated, right? I think it
is the wideness of the conversation and the fact that there are so many people you might hear from 
that make you feel cautious and insecure and unsafe, and the good of it is the bad
of ita€! LINK: <https://kottke.org/21 /04/the-conversation-has-never-been-widei>

Adam Posen: Americaa€™s Self-Defeating Economic Retreat: a€~Populist anger is the result not of 
economic anxiety but of perceived declines in relative status. The U.S.
government has not been pursuing openness and integration over the last two decades. To the 
contrary, it has increasingly insulated the economy from foreign competition, while the
rest                                                                                   of the world 
has continued to open up and integrate. Protecting manufacturing jobs benefits only a small 
percentage of the workforce, while imposing substantial costs on the
rest. Nor will there be any political payoff from trying to do so: after all, even as the United 
States has stepped back from global commerce, anger and extremism have mounted.a€!

Anders A...slund: Russiaa€™s Bear Economy. a€~Russiaa€! ha[s]a€! registered no real growth since 
2014a€!. Though Russia had a higher per capita GDP (in terms of
purchasing power parity) than Croatia, Poland, Romania, and Turkey as recently as 2009, all of 
these countries have since overtaken it. Russians today are shocked to learn that they
are  worse off than Romanians and Turks. Among EU member states, only Bulgaria is still poorer than 
Russia. With its close proximity to the EU single market, Russia could have
had higher growth if it had pursued sound economic policies. Instead, Putin has utterly squandered 
the countrya€™ s abundant human capital through corrupt cronyism and
systematic deinstitutionalization. His politicization of the courts and law enforcement has 
eliminated any pretext of rule of lawa€”a prerequisite for private investment and business
development. Apparently, Putin believes the economy is less important than the ability to kill 
opponents like Boris Nemtsov and Alexei Navalny (who was recently transferred from
prison   to a hospital, reportedly near death)a€!
