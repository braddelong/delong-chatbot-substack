In all but rare and exceptional times, the only return return debt purchasers and holders have demanded from the U.S. government is that it maintain the real value of the wealth they have entrusted to it. The U.S. government should invest this wealth wisely and prudently, yes, in the highest societal-value projects, yes. But the main consideration and the bottom line is that—except in the 1870s and 1880s, and in the 1980s—the U.S. government has never faced a debt-financing constraint as long as long as its investments yield any possible positive return in the form of additional taxes collected downstream at all. Worried that this may change in the future if interest rates rise sharply? Then issue inflation-adjusted consols, and lock in real debt payments permanently:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Barry Eichengreen</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Coming Public Debt Scare Should Not Spook U.S. Policymakers from Investing in Physical &amp; Social Infrastructure</em>: ‘[In our]&nbsp;<em>In Defense of Public Debt</em>, my co-authors and I show how governments, through the ages, have resorted to issuing public debt to meet emergencies and address pressing social needs…. My co-authors and I argue [that] expenditure restraints that limit the U.S. economy’s capacity to grow would be counterproductive from even the narrow standpoint of debt sustainability…. Do our nation’s infrastructure problems rise to the level of a national emergency? Some answer yes, on the grounds that our physical infrastructure is old, dangerously vulnerable to climate change, and inadequately green and digital. A significant minority in the U.S. Senate insists otherwise…. One way of adjudicating the dispute is to ask whether additional infrastructure investments will pay for themselves…. We really should be comparing apples with apples—real returns with real returns. Currently… any investment that yields a positive real return is effectively self-financing…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/the-coming-public-debt-scare-should-not-spook-u-s-policymakers-from-investing-in-physical-and-social-infrastructure/">https://equitablegrowth.org/the-coming-public-debt-scare-should-not-spook-u-s-policymakers-from-investing-in-physical-and-social-infrastructure/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p></p><h3>Plus:</h3><p>Endorse:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Paul Campos</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Sociopathic Style in American Politics</em>: ‘This is quite literally their position. People should be free to acquire and transmit to others a deadly and extremely communicable virus… even though this catastrophe could be avoided completely if people chose to take a free and safe vaccine. Furthermore, it’s morally wrong for the government to engage in even the mildest coercion to nudge people toward getting vaccinated, because such coercion interferes with individual liberty…. The sacral status of Individual Liberty requires allowing countless individual choices to wreck the ecosphere via what economists refer to primly as the failure to take into account unpriced externalities, while elementary schools are shot up by semi-automatic weapons, and millions of Americans have no income other than food stamps, even as multi-billionaires rig the tax code ever-more in the favor, because that what Freedom means, according to the Constitution or the Bible or possibly both…. You’re Not the Boss of Me is not a sustainable basis for even the most tenuous society…. The apparent contradiction between the sociopathic style and the authoritarian personality is resolved easily enough when we remember that, to those who long to make America great again, freedom means freedom for me and not for you…. Sincere engagement with the nation’s right wing in general and the Republican party in particular is about as advisable as going on a blind date with Ted Bundy. And the otherwise inexplicably bizarre reaction of these people to even the mildest vaccine mandates makes perfect sense when we remember who we are actually dealing with…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2021/09/the-sociopathic-style-in-american-politics">https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2021/09/the-sociopathic-style-in-american-politics</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-09-10-fr?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-09-10-fr?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>ONE VIDEO:</h2><p><strong>BBC Click</strong>: <em>Inside The Worlds Largest Semiconductor Factory</em>  &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb1WDxSoSec">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb1WDxSoSec</a>&gt;:</p><div id="youtube2-Hb1WDxSoSec" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Hb1WDxSoSec&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hb1WDxSoSec?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay;

Then we shall see whether California’s long experiment with postmodern deracination and anti-masculinity can stand up to Texas’s more robust embrace of the old virtues. I’m not a betting man, but were that conflict to erupt, my money would be on Texas.”… In Texas, Joe Biden got 46 per cent of the vote as against 52 per cent for Trump. That’s hardly a state in a position to unify and attack California.&nbsp; The civil strife America has to worry about is persistent terrorism from so-called “lone wolves” radicalized by the extremist ideology that the Antons of the world promote. The return of conflicts modeled on the massed armies of the 19th century is virtually impossible…. The term “deracination” should set off alarm bells…. In…&nbsp;<em>The Battle Cry of Freedom</em>&nbsp;(1988)… James McPherson delineated this thinking…. “Southerners invented a genealogy that portrayed Yankees as descendants of the medieval Anglo-Saxons and southerners as descendants of their Norman conquerors….

In a decade or so China will, if the Communist Party has its way, become a techno-utopia with Chinese characteristics, replete with “deep tech” such as cloud-computing, artificial intelligence (ai), self-driving cars and home-made cutting-edge chips. Incumbent technology giants such as Alibaba in e-commerce or Tencent in payments and entertainment will be around but less overweening—and less lucrative. Policies to curb their market power will redistribute some of their profits to smaller merchants and app developers, and to their workers. Second-tier cities will boast their own tech industries with localised services, competing with the less-mighty titans. Data will pulse through the system, available to firms of all sizes, under the watchful eye of the government in Beijing. China’s internet will strengthen its authoritarian design. Clearer, too, is the way in which President Xi Jinping wants to make this vision a reality. Besides talking up deep tech, this involves taking the shallower sort down a peg…. Many politicians in America and Europe would love to fashion their tech industry into something like Mr Xi’s vision: less social media and other “spiritual opium”, as Chinese state news outlets recently dubbed video-gaming; more strategic development of the techno-infrastructure of the 21st century. This includes computer chips, clean energy and much besides…. The policies behind the techlash are born of sweeping goals for society from the highest reaches of central government, an echelon of engineers and economists who lack expertise in most of the sectors being targeted…. Apparently without irony, Chinese media have likened the government’s push to spur domestic chipmaking to the Great Leap Forward…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.economist.com/business/what-tech-does-china-want/21803410?itm_source=parsely-api">https://www.economist.com/business/what-tech-does-china-want/21803410?itm_source=parsely-api</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Douglas London</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Afghanistan Not An Intelligence Failure—Something Much Worse</em>: ‘In grading their own homework, the U.S. defense establishment only exacerbated the problem.
