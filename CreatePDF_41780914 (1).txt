Hannah Martin. Photography by Alanna Hale: Tour an Arts and Crafts Home in Berkeley Where 
Sustainability Reigns Supreme’. a€~Urban planner Vishaan Chakrabartia€! unveiled a proposal in The 
New York Times: Banish most privately-owned cars from Manhattan. Interestingly, that same month, he 
and his family were moving to what most people would consider a car place: Berkeley, California. 
There, Chakrabarti would serve as the new
dean of U.C. Berkeleya€™ s College of Environmental Design. a€oeWe didna€™ t want to suddenly have 
a car,a€D Chakrabarti says. He and his wife Maria Alataris, also an architect and founder of maa 
designs, have lived in Manhattan for 30 years and now have two teenage kids. a€oeWea€™re not used 
to driving to get a quart of milk, or to drop a kid off at school. Ita€™ s just not the way we 
live.aCD So they landed in Elmwood, an old
residential neighborhood just a twenty minute walk from the Deana€™ s Office at Berkeley, pretty 
close to their daughtersaC™ school, and near a local BART station for easy access to San 
FranciscoaCI

Sam Abbott: The Child Care Economy. a€~How investments in early care and education can fuel U.S. 
economic growth immediately and over the long term. Fast facts: Insufficient child care options can 
prevent parents who wish to work from doing so, with mothers often bearing the brunt of this 
challenged!. High-quality early care and education provides critical socialization and learning 
opportunities when the brain is developing rapidlya€!. Adequate funding is
necessary for human capital developmenta€!. Supporting child care workers is crucial for promoting 
quality care and human capital developmenta€!. Investing in the nationa€™ s children is one of the 
safest bets policymakers can make. Research on early care and education programs finds that $1 in 
spending generates $8.60 in economic activitya€!

Benjamin Welton: 10 Little-Known Facts From The Crimean Slave Trade'. a€~One of the longest, yet

Khanate, a Muslim state that was a vassal of the Ottoman Turks. Existing from 1449 until 1783, the 
Crimean Khanate was both a giant repository for slaves (most of whom were Slavic Christians) and 
one of Europea€™ s largest slave markets.The Crimean Tatars and the Turkic
Nogai people were responsible for one of the largest slave trades in history. Yet almost nobody 
outside of Ukraine and Russia has heard of thema€!

Zach Carter: Why Are Moderates Trying to Blow Up Bidena€™ s Centrist Economic Plan?'. a€~John 
Kenneth Galbraith, the great liberal economist, once referred to his hero Keynes as an avatar of 
a€oeenlightened conservatism.a€D In Galbraitha€™ s telling, Keynes so revered the institutions 
around hima€”the British Empire, the Bank of England, the operaa€”that he was willing to break with 
economic orthodoxy to defend them. Mr. Bidena€™ s agenda does represent
a break with the policy agenda of the past 30 years, just as Keynesa€™ s and Roosevelta€™ s did 
nearly 90 years ago. But it ultimately demands very little from those in power. They need only act 
according to their own best interests, supporting a program that already conforms to their 
ideological predilections. Trimming Mr. Bidena€™ s agenda for the sake of trimming it is neither 
enlightened nor conservative; ita€™ s just a waste of time and democracya€!

Julia Carrie Wong @juliacarriew

Ita€™ s true that if you mischaracterize what Franzen said by ignoring half of his stated reason 
(the context of the BLM uprisings), you can twist it into a point thata€™ s easier to attack, but 
since we can all read what he actually said, the only person who looks bad here is you.

Recently he’s passed on opportunities to express
his views about free speech and social media.

When writer George Packer, a friend, emailed him

last summer to ask whether he might like to sign an
open letter published in Harper’s that called for
“the free exchange of information and ideas,”
which it claimed “is daily becoming more
constricted” by “calls for swift and severe
retribution in response to perceived

transgressions of speech and thought,” he

declined. “I felt it could be construed as somehow
an attack on Black Lives Matter at a moment when


that was just not the thing to do,” Franzen says.
“There’s a chilling of nuanced discourse...but I also
think, until people start being sent off to Lubyanka
for having said the wrong thing to the wrong
person, the risk is probably overblown.’Tnstead,
he’s  been spending his time writing the second

part of his planned trilogy, A Key to All

Jonathan Franzen's reason for not signing the harper's Letter is one of the most insane things I've

In 1920, Ernest Frederick McIntyre Bicke, a popular student at the University of Wisconsin, changed 
his name. He had just taken up professional acting, with early career appearances as as an extra. 
He adopted the stage name Fredric March, under which he became a distinguished stage a€!
