FOCUS: DRAFT: DeLong: SSHA Session: Introduction:

Thank you very much. One of the great things about having finally managed to get this book out into 
the world is to discover how many friends I have, the book has, and economic history hasa€”how many 
people are interested in thinking and thinking hard
about what we know about the long run shape of human economic history.

What are the stories we should tell ourselves about the very long run? What do we know about the 
very long-run shape of human economic history?

1. We think that people became markedly less fit after the coming of agriculture.

2. We think pre-industrial rates of population growth were absurdly, ridiculously low given human 
fertility, the patriarchal imperative to have surviving sons, and the fact that approximately a 
third of humans wound up without such.

3. (1) and (2) together give us a picture of a humanity after the coming of agriculture and before 
the coming of modern economic growth that was desperately, horribly poor.

4. And we can discern no visible trend in material standards of living for typical humans until 
relatively late in the early modern age.

5. Humans are productive. Ideas are productive, capital is productive, and resources are scarce.

6. We have our guesses as to human populations and standards of living, for what they are worth. 
Parenthetically, let me draw your attention to what I think are the two greatest uncertainties in 
these guesses.

7. The first is the population of humanity around the year a€“1000. Is it the approximately fifty 
million that McEvedy and Jones assigned to it long ago, and that most other people since have 
followed them in adopting, or is it the hundred million
or so that the HYDE people have settled on? This makes a substantial difference with respect to how 
one views the Iron Age vis-A -vis the preceding Bronze Age.

8. The second is that our guesses of material living standards are more-or less-at factor cost, 
when what we really wish for is estimates of user benefit. The ratio of user surplus to factor cost 
is highly unlikely to be constanta€’’especially when we
compare constant returns to scale rival commodities with those produced with strongly increasing 
returns.

9. Putting these two issues to the side, our guesses are what they are:

Let me claim, further, that, at world scale, fluctuations in the human economya€™ s 
capital-intensity are relatively unimportant, so that the predominant factors affecting human 
productivity and standards of living are (a) successfully deployed-and-diffused
ideas (about manipulating nature and cooperatively organizing humans) on the one hand and (b) 
resources per worker on the other. I guess that a measure of the value of the deployed-and 
diffused-human ideas stock H = yYsP: average real income per capita
times the square root of population.

Why the square root?

Well to take the value of human ideas H to be average real income times population raised to the 
zeroeth power would be to say that resource scarcity is not a thing. That is false. To take average 
real income times population raised to the first power would be
to say that humans are not productive. That is also false. The square-roota€’’raised to 1/2 
powera€”is in between.

If anyone has a better idea, I would happily adopt it.

So then what do our guesses about average real income and population give us in terms of guesses of 
the value of the human ideas stock H? This:

What story does this table tell?
It tells a story of:

•  humanity, ensorcelled by the Devil of Malthus, trapped in dire poverty, with technology growth 
exceedingly small by our standards until at least 1770, on a world scale at least.

•  humanity desperately poor, spending hours a day thinking about how hungry you are poor, watching 
half your babies die, before 1870.

•  after 1870 wealth and productivity explode; indeed, people looking back a generation or two 
later talk about 1870 as the beginning of a€oeEconomic El Doradoa€D.

• after 1870 the demographic transition spreading from being a Franco-Belgian peculiarity to 
eventually cover the entire world.

• after 1870 it becomes becomes clear within a generation or two that humanity, is for the first 
time in history, possessed of the prospect that it will relatively soon have the productive mojo to 
bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everybody to
have enough.

Thus before 1870 the road is closed, and after 1870 the road to utopia opens, or ought to have 
opened after 1870. With the problem of baking a sufficiently large economic pie being solved, what 
remains are what our predecessors would have seen as the
second-order problems of slicing and tasting the piea€”of equitably distributing it, and of 
utilizing our fabulous wealth to live a€oewisely and wella€D. With baking solved, the problem of 
attaining utopia were then, in the eyes of previous generationsa€™
thinkers like Francis Bacon, simply second-order problems.

Most of what made human humanity poor, and human life nasty, brutish, and short, back before 1870 
was our inability to bake a sufficiently large economic pie for everyone to potentially have 
enough.

But in addition, piling Pelion upon Ossa and making life nastier, britisher, and even shorter, were 
the consequences of that poverty. The only way to get enough for yourself and your family back then 
was for you to constitute yourself as part of an A©lite and
successfully run a domination-and-exploitation game on the rest of humanity. Thus governance and 
politics were primarily dissipative, destructive of much of the wealth that was created. For rulers 
and A©lites, those in charge and their bully-boy thugs-with-
spears (and later thugs-with-gunpowder weapons), assisted by their tame accountants, bureaucrats, 
and propagandists, reaped where they did not sow and gathered where they did not scatter, and 
consumed much more of societya€™ s potential energy in their
force-and-fraud machines than they were ultimately able to consume.

That was much of what was wrong with human society back before 1870.

It would not, back then, have seemed unreasonable to expect that those force-and-fraud 
exploitation-and-domination machines would go away once an economy pie large enough for everyone to 
potentially have enough was bakeable.

We are well on the way to baking the sufficiently large economic pie. Here we are. It is 15 degrees 
Fahrenheit outside. We are not huddled under every blanket we can pile together, but are, if 
anything, slightly too warm here inside, because thehotelis
overheated while I at least am in clothes that were made for Scotland in 1651, back when the 
closest equivalent to a source of gortex you have is a sheep.

Yet, in spite of our wealth fabulous in historical perspective, what were supposed to be 
second-order problemsa€”the problems of slicing and tasting the economic pie, of equitably 
distributing and properly utilizing it so that people feelsafe and secure and
are healthy and happy a€’’continue to pretty much flummox us.

In large part, they flummox us because technological progress is so fast, very single generation we 
have Schumpeterian creative destruction revolutionizing economy and society. Every generation it 
gives us a brand-new set of forces-of-production hardware.
We then have to frantically write new socio-econo-political-cultural relations-of-production, 
-communication, -organization, -and-so-on software to run on top of it so the whole thing doesna€™ 
t crash. We try to figure out how to get the proper benefits of
decentralization and incentivization on the one hand, while on the other hand not reducing society 
to a state where the only rights that are recognized are property rights and thus the only people 
who have any social power are those who have been lucky or
who    chose the right parents.

Those were the conclusions I arrived at after making up this table, and then staring at it for a 
good long while.

Now we could look backward from 1870: asking the question of how we got to the point of explosion. 
We could look forward from 1870: asking about the working-out of the logic of unprecedented, 
revolutionary, economic growth generation after
generation, and that growtha€™ s political-economy consequences.

I wound up writing a book looking forward from 1870 at the political-economy consequences.

I still regret not also managing to write the Landes-Schumpeter, book about the working out of the 
process of economic growth after 1870.

And I mourn my inability to write a comprehensive book looking backward from 1870 about how we got 
to the point of explosion. But I am cheered by noting that, this year alone, each in their own way, 
Oded Galor and also Mark Koyama and Jared Rubin
have published very good works of synthesis on these questions.

But there is another question, about the extent to which we should take 1870 to be in some sense 
the hinge of history.

Matthew Yglesias informs me that Robert Nozick, when he died, was trying to develop a philosophy of 
counterfactuals: to distinguish sharply between a€oecausally thina€D and a€oecausally thicka€D 
processes.
Mostly, Matt thinks, this was because it amused Nozick to troll other members of the Harvard 
faculty with respect to the trajectory of Marxian Socialisma€’’Nozick maintained that:

1. A Russian revolution was causally-thick, in that there is no reasonable counterfactual in which 
Russia does not have a revolution after 1900;

counterfactuals: to distinguish sharply between a€oecausally thina€D and a€oecausally thicka€D 
processes.
Mostly, Matt thinks, this was because it amused Nozick to troll other members of the Harvard 
faculty with respect to the trajectory of Marxian Socialisma€’’Nozick maintained that:

1. A Russian revolution was causally-thick, in that there is no reasonable counterfactual in which 
Russia does not have a revolution after 1900;

2. A Leninist Russian revolution, was causally-thin, in that it is easy to think of counterfactuals 
in which the Bolsheviks are forgotten well before 1930, and quite difficult to see the 
stabilization of the really-existing socialist Leninist Bolshevik
regime as anything but the most freakish and unlikely mischance;

3. However, conditional on Leninism, the emergence of something like Stalinism is another 
causally-thick process, for there no reasonable counterfactual in which Lenina€™ s regime is not 
followed by a larger disaster.

Indeed, Max Weber predicted this in 1918. When Joseph Schumpeter said that the Leninist Russia 
would be an a€oeinteresting laboratorya€D for experiments in economics, Weber is said to have 
roared back: "a laboratory littered with human corpses!a€D
and then stormed out of Viennaa€™ s CafA© Central, or so the story goes.

Suppose we apply this Nozickian framework to human economic history. Two natural questions are:

•  Was the explosion of wealth and productivity of 1870, the Second industrial Revolution, the one 
big wave of Robert Gordon, causally-thin, in the sense that institutions had to evolve then in a 
way that was unlikely to get the explosion?

• Was the actual causally-thin nexus, instead, or nexuses earlier?

Could we very easily have avoided the last few institutions need to support the Second Industrial 
Revolution and Modern Economic Growth falling into place in 1870? Simon Kuznets was very firm that 
Modern Economic Growth was a different animal than
what was going on during the British Industrial Revolution. In the British Industrial Revolution 
era of 1770a€“1870 world technological progress was perhaps a hair less than 0.5% per year. With 
the processes then ongoing prea€“1870, it seems more likely
than not that posta€“1870 technological progress would have been slower than that. A lot of global 
growth in deployed-and-diffused technology over 1770a€“1870 comes from the globalization-driven 
concentration of manufacturing worldwide into the
districts in which manufacturing was most productive, largely the British Midlands. You can only do 
that once. A lot of global growth in the power of deployed-and-diffused technology over 1770a€“1870 
came from its complementarity with stored sunlight
in  the form of coal and from the fact that the last round of glaciers had been bulldozers that 
scraped off post-carboniferous rock and gave us really cheap coal at sea level where it could be 
floated anywhere for pence. As of 1870 that coal was running out;
William Stanley Jevons made his first splash in economics by pointing that out.

If Jack Goldstone were here, he would probably make his argument that the British Industrial 
Revolution is perhaps viewed as the last a€oeefflorescencea€U. Had posta€“1870 technological growth 
fallen back from its 1770a€“1870 pace, we might now be
sitting here with the technologies of 1903 trying to support our same world population of 8 
billion. We would then be much, much, poorer. We would be sending people by the tens of thousand to 
islands in the South Pacific with pickaxes to mine guano.

Was the Second Industrial Revolution an eye-of-the-needle event?

Earlier this fall at Berkeley the extremely learned Robert Brenner said a€oenoa€D. He lectured me 
for 45 minutes about how the true causally-thin nexus came much earlier: the emergence, in the two 
centuries after the Black Death, in the 300 mile-radius
circle around Dover, of market-bourgeois class relations, and thus the transformation of (a) a 
society of peasants, knights, lords, and the occasional merchant into (b) a society of laborers, 
craftsman, merchants, farmers, landlords, mercenaries, and plutocrat­
politicians. After that it was baked in the cake. And it is entirely right and just that Robert do 
this. He has, after all, been writing this since I was 15. Indeed, I remember, back when I was 20, 
David Landes telling me: you need to pay a great deal of attention
to Robert Brenner.

Some here say that the causally-thin counterfactual nexus word was the founding of the Royal 
Society and nullius in verba, a€oenothing by worda€D. This shift from (a) ideas spreading primarily 
because they are useful to an upper class A©lite running a
force-and-fraud domination-and-exploitation scheme on the rest of society, to (b) ideas spreading 
because they are true of empirical reality.

Others would talk about how the true truly unusual Nexus is the development of an extraordinary 
level of social trust.

Others might go back to the Emperor Heinrich IV Salier, reportedly standing in the snow outside of 
the castle at Canossa in 1077, and the establishment of the principle that the law is not just a 
tool for but binds even the most powerful.

Or you might even go back to the emergence of a strict monotheisma€”a God focused not on this world 
but on heaven and hella€”in which case in this world one should praise the Lord, yes, but what is 
important here and now is to pass the ammunition.
What is the best narrative, the best grand narrative, for human economic history? Or what is the 
best grand narrative for us? Or are we better off without grand narratives at all? Might this whole 
project simply have been ill-advised?
