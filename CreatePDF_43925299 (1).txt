Chris Best & Hamish McKenzie: The Internet Needs Better Rules, Not Stricter Referees: a€~People are 
taking the wrong lessons from the Facebook Papersa€!. The key to a healthier platform is to flip 
the power dynamic: give the people themselves the power to choose what they pay attention to. Let 
the will of the people control their feeds, not the other way around. Instead of
removing peoplea€™ s agency by manipulating their attention in favor of the most profitable and 
provocative content, let them seek out what they really value. Other than in extreme cases 
involving violence or illicit activity, people should be allowed to decide for themselves whoa€™ s 
worth listening to, whata€™ s trustworthy, and which direction is punching a€cedown.a€D
Beyond being undesirable, relying only on top-down moderation is ineffective: tech companies 
didna€™t invent teen insecurity or tribal resentments, and they wona€™t fix those problems through 
censorship whack-a-mole. There is no world in which all vexing views can be banished. And if there 
were, none of us should want to live in it. There will be no perfect internet, but there
can  be a better one. A healthier internet requires overhauling incentives by putting people back 
in chargea€!

Paragraphs:

Timothy B. Lee: The 2000s Housing Bubble Was Greatly Exaggerated: a€~Housing prices are now above 
the supposedly unsustainable levels of 2006. And thata€™ s after adjusting for inflation. And yet 
not very many people think wea€™re in the middle of a second housing bubble. Rather, most experts 
believe that todaya€™ s housing prices reflect a€ce fundamental a€D factors.
Interest rates are at all-time lows, giving homebuyers more spending power. And regulatory 
restrictions have created housing shortages in many metropolitan areas. But that leads to a 
question that at first glance might seem crazy: what if those same explanations largely explain the 
housing boom that peaked in 2006? What if the big problem in the early 2000s wasna€™ t an excess of
houses but a shortage of them?a€! Thata€™ s the thesis of Shut Out, a 2019 book by Kevin 
Erdmanna€!. Erdmann argues that policymakers misdiagnosed the causes of the housing boom, and that 
led to catastrophic policy errors. In particular, because the Federal Reserve thought housing was 
overvalued in 2007, it didna€™ t cut rates fast enough in response to the housing crasha€!.
If Erdmann and Schubert are right, wea€™re still living with the consequences of misdiagnosing the 
housing boom as a speculative bubblea€!

Timothy Burke: Viewpoint Diversity (Not Again! Edition): a€™Doesna€™t matter how many times you 
think youa€™ ve beaten the Terminator, it always comes back to life. Doesna€™t matter how many 
times folks try, wearily, to challenge a very particular subset of self-validating public 
intellectuals with prestigious academic positions and secure access to major publications
who continuously howl to the moon about how illiberal and narrow-minded academia or public culture 
has become, how silenced they have been. Theya€™ 11 be back at it tomorrow with the same complaint, 
unaffected by any objections, challenges or conversations, announcing just how sagely heterodox 
they are. For folks in that little segment of the world, when you point out the
actually narrow range of viewpoints they collectively hold to, theya€™ 11 typically respond that 
youa€™ re wrong: some of them are Democrats and some of them are Republicans, as if thata€™ s what 
a€oeviewpoint diversitya€D means. Ia€™ m all for what I might mean by that phrase were I able to 
use it with any seriousness, given its capacious misuse by others. I once tried to
put  this as thinking of ideas, theories, methods, or frameworks within the academy in terms of 
a€oepositive libertiesa€D, e.g., that rather than saying a€oewe should have free speecha€D as a 
negative liberty a€’’that we do not suppress what a person already in the community might wish to 
saya€”we should say, a€oewea€™re trying to encourage the widest range of thinking and
curiosity within the academy, we want to produce more variety and stimulate more idiosyncrasy, even 
just as conjectures, thought-experiments, explorations in curiosity .a€D That would be a good 
thing. Thata€™ s what a€ceheterodoxya€D could really meana€!. If youa€™re really about heterodoxy, 
youa€™re about curiosity, about disagreeing with yourself, about uncertainty,
about being provisional. Youa€™re about seeking the best objections to your strongest argumentsa€!. 
People who know ita€™ s hard sometimes at least have the humility to not constantly beat their 
chests celebrating their own openness of mind and commitment to heterodoxy.

Samuel Pepys: a€™I home, and there to talk, with great pleasure all the evening, with my wife, who 
tells me that Deb. has been abroad today, and is come home and says she has got a place to go to, 
so as she will be gone tomorrow morning." This troubled me, and the truth is, I have a good mind to 
have the maidenhead of this girl, which I should not doubt to havea€!. But she will
be gone and I not know whither. Before we went to bed my wife told me she would not have me to see 
Deb. or give her her wages, and so I did give my wife 101. for her year and half a quartera€™ s 
wages, which she went into her chamber and paid her. And so to bed, and there, blessed be God! we 
did sleep well and with peace, which I had not done in now almost twenty nights
together. Up, and had a mighty mind to have seen or given Deb. a little money, to which purpose I 
wrapt up 40s. in paper, thinking to have given her a little money, but my wife rose presently, and 
would not let me be out of her sight. My wife went down before me into the kitchen, and come up and 
told me that Deb. was in the kitchen, and therefore would have me go round the other
way. Which she repeating and I vexed at it, answered her a little angrily, upon which she instantly 
flew out into a rage, calling me dog and rogue, and that I had a rotten heart; all which, knowing 
that I deserved it, I bore with. Word being brought presently up that Deb. was gone away by coach 
with her things, my wife was friends, and so all quiet, and I to the Office, with my heart
sad, and find that I cannot forget the girl, and vexed I know not where to look for her. And more 
troubled to see how my wife is by this means likely for ever to have her hand over me, that I shall 
for ever be a slave to her. That is to say only in matters of pleasure, but in other things she 
will make her business to please me and to keep me right to her, which I will labour to be, for she
deserves it of me, though it will be I fear a little time before I shall be able to wear Deb out of 
my mind. At the Office all the morning, and merry at noon, at dinner; and after dinner to the 
Office, where all the afternoon, doing much business, late. My mind being free of all troubles, I 
thank God, but only for my thoughts of this girl, which hang after hera€!
