They were the (then distant, and now thankfully still distant) possibilities of: (1) Weimar Russia (ex-superpower that thought it had been snookered by the west at the end of a struggle), (2) National Hinduist India (casting Muslims in the historical role traditionally reserved for the Jews), and (3) Wilhelmine China‚Äìa rising economic superpower, ruled by a class that had lost its social role, and that contemplated busying giddy minds with foreign quarrels as a way to distract popular attention from internal problems and debates. </p><p>Let me highlight this. Why? Because Martin Wolf has also been worrying about Wilhelmine China. The problem is that a social class that has lost its role‚Äìwhether it is the Prussian aristocracy before 1914 or the cadres of the CCP today‚Äìknows that it has lost its role, and fears what the future brings. The task of United States (and Japanese, and Korean) foreign policy has to be to persuade the cadres of the CCP that they have much more to gain from an Eastern Pacific that lives up to its name rather than from a new cold war in Asia‚Äìor a hot one:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Martin Wolf</strong>: <em>China Must Not Copy the Kaiser‚Äôs Errors</em>: ‚ÄôWill we sustain an open global economy while also managing tensions between a rising autocracy and democracies in relative economic decline? That was the question posed by the arrival of imperial Germany as Europe‚Äôs leading economic and military power in the late 19th century. It is the question posed today by the rise of communist China‚Ä¶. We know how this story ended in 1914. How will the new one end, a century later? China‚Äôs decision to create an ‚ÄúEast China Sea air defence identification zone‚Äù that covers uninhabited islands currently under the control of Japan (called Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China) is evidently provocative: the two countries‚Äô air defence zones now overlap. Neither Japan nor South Korea recognises the new zone, which China seems prepared to defend. The US does not recognise the zone either, and is bound by treaty to support Japan‚Ä¶. The risk of a ruinous conflict again exists‚Ä¶. Why would the Chinese president take such a provocative action?‚Ä¶ This was just the question raised by Norman Angell, the English liberal, in his 1909 book The Great Illusion. Angell did not argue, as some allege, that war among the European great powers was inconceivable‚Ä¶. He argued instead that a war would be fruitless, even for the victors‚Ä¶. Mr Xi should think again‚Äîand halt‚Ä¶ </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/12/wilhelmine-china-and-the-ecsadiz.html">https://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/12/wilhelmine-china-and-the-ecsadiz.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p>For thirty years I have wanted a computer that was a tablet when I needed it to be, and that I could plug in a keyboard when I wanted one.

So we have Manchin leaning into patriotism while all but four Republicans are leaning away from patriotism, filibustering the legislation, probably today. At the same time, Manchin said, ‚ÄúThere is no excuse for any Republican to vote against this commission.‚Äù Hell, he‚Äôs got on his side the mom of a dead Capitol cop, who said: ‚ÄúI suggest that all congressmen and senators who are against this bill visit my son‚Äôs grave‚Äù (my italics).
