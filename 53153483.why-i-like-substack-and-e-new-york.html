What if Vladimir Putin used Substack as his main platform for denying the atrocities that his armies are committing in Ukraine? At some point, nearly every platform’s administrators are going to encounter some moral red line…. If I were running Substack, I would probably be more restrictive about anti-vaccine content, given the fact that the vaccines’ safety and efficacy is so proven and that so many people have died from refusing to get vaccinated….</p></li><li><p>“Substack, unlike many platforms, is not a public square. Platforms like Twitter are public squares, because they have strong network effects…. The fact that there can be only one Twitter gives the platform a degree of social responsibility that it would not otherwise have…. Substack isn’t like that….</p></li><li><p>“Most of the people reading this post are folks who love to have world events filtered through the analytical lens of Noah Smith (and I am grateful!). But if a reader is looking for smaller samples of 50 different voices, they’ll probably want to subscribe to a newspaper instead of 4 Substacks. And if you think you’re the kind of writer who appeals more to that kind of reader, then don’t quit your day job…. The more distinctive your voice and your perspective is, the more you should take a look at Substack….</p></li><li><p>“Writing for a living is not a good career—if you want a good salary, follow the cliché and learn to code. Or go work for private equity…”</p></li></ul><p>What do I think about this?</p><p>First, I think Noah is wrong at at least one point: SubStack is a (potentially) important part of our Public Sphere(s). It is (potentially) important because it is (possibly) less afflicted by the dopamine-loop and clickbait biases that afflict short-form and audiovisual and especially advertising-supported media. As such, it is very much worth supporting and betting on—unless you can see a more favorable wager to place in our collective task of trying to keep our collective decision-making processes from becoming even worse than they are.</p><p>Will substack avoid the market-economy money-making corporate pressures that, given human psychology and given that SubStack is a corporation aimed at some horizon at making money, dissolve reason into madness? Probably not. Google serves as a cautionary tale. Those of us who want a better Public Sphere need to always be prepared to migrate to the next green pasture win this piece of the digital commons becomes a poisonous wasteland.</p><p>But if we can get influencers following links from Twitter to SubStack and then actually reading arguments, we will have a much better system. So I would urge everyone who wants to make a positive contribution to write things on SubStack, and then drop a link on Twitter—along with other links on Twitter to other people’s things on SubStack that you see as useful and informative. You won’t get rich, but you will be contributing more than if you simply retweet your doomscrolling.</p><p>I think I am going to be on SubStack for a while. The first reason is that I do not see a better bet to place a with respect to our collective task of improving our Public Sphere. The second is that my weblog has long served as my external brain back, and has served me very well. As a age, the desirability of my having a very good external brain pack becomes greater. And I do not see a better workflow for creating one than the path currently offered by SubStack.</p><div><hr></div><p>Also see:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tomas Pueyo</strong>: <em>The Future of Substack</em>: ‘The Substack mobile app…. Search and discover new authors…. Recommendations, “a new way for writers on Substack to recommend each other and discover more great work”…. Authors have a lot of power: they can disintermediate Medium because readers care who their favorite authors are, and are willing to follow them…. Substack created a SaaS tool for long-form articles giving all the power to the authors…. Substack needs some network effects to keep authors tied to the platform, even if they can leave at any moment. The best way to achieve that is through cross-promotion tools that allow authors to constantly gain new readers that they wouldn’t gain otherwise…. So Substack will keep building tools to cross-promote readers from one author to another…. The best way to optimize so many authors and readers?

Miami declares ‘heat season’ as temperatures rise…. India this year experienced its hottest March in 12 decades of records, and one of its driest. Next came the third-hottest April, after 2010 and 2016. Then it got even hotter. New Delhi saw an average maximum April temperature of 40.2° Celsius (104.4° Fahrenheit), according to the Times of India. The heat is jeopardizing the country’s wheat supply, just as Russia’s war in Ukraine disrupted trade from Eastern Europe. Temperatures in neighboring Pakistan’s Jacobabad rose to 47°C (116.6°F)…. Global temperatures have climbed 1.2° Celsius since the mid–19th century.

Yes, cities will increasingly grow because they are nice places to live rather than productive places to work. But a great many of those who vote, of the current residents, will define "nice place to be” as "place that does not change". It is true that NIMBYist policies are, right now, additionally incentivized by the fact that "place that does not change" also makes homeowners fabulously rich—if they are willing to move out—in productive-work cities. That will melt away, and diminish NIMBYist energy. But a lot will remain:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Connor O’Brien</strong>: <em>Finding Opportunity in Urban Flight</em>: ‘People migrate to cities for… reasons… [that] boil down to two buckets… “amenities”… [and] the strength and depth of labor markets. People move to cities to work, but not necessarily for a particular job…. At its best, this labor market agglomeration looks something like AnnaLee Saxenian’s fascinating 1996 portrayal of Silicon Valley’s business environment, <em>Regional Advantage</em>. Workers are constantly bouncing between employers, starting their own highly specialized firms, and interacting with university and industry researchers on the cutting edge at industry forums, more structured R&amp;D environments, or local bars. This force is why “superstar” firms have tended to concentrate in superstar cities, where they become more productive despite higher labor and real estate costs…. In a world of widespread remote work, cities are forced to lure people, not firms. Livability and affordability will matter more…. The competition between cities will increasingly take place on turf friendly to urbanists and YIMBYs. Cities will have an incentive to align themselves with pro-growth advocates for permitting more market-rate affordable housing so that workers aren’t forking over 30 or 40 percent of their income each month in rent. If cities want to attract a new class of remote workers, they’ll also need to provide larger living spaces…. While remote work is on one level a tool that enables people to leave pricey cities for lower-cost places, it may also force cities to finally confront long-simmering quality of life problems…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:52502153,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://regions.substack.com/p/finding-opportunity-in-urban-flight&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:684069,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Regions&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Finding opportunity in urban flight &quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;This is perhaps the most interesting moment in decades to be studying or otherwise thinking about the future of American cities.

Any further questions?:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Joseph Politano</strong>: <em>America’s Homebuilding Boom (That Isn’t)</em>: ‘America is Building More Than it has in a Decade. It’s Nowhere Near Enough…. Today, new housing starts are higher than at any point since early 2006—but it’s nowhere near enough to keep up with population growth, let alone make up for the decade of lost construction. The pandemic has driven increased demand for housing as living patterns shift and incomes improve, but construction is falling behind. Supply chain issues are increasing building costs, keeping housing completions low, and preventing many projects from even breaking ground. Underconstruction has pushed vacancy rates to the lowest levels in nearly 40 years, indicating just how severe the housing shortage has gotten. There may be a construction boom, but it’s a false boom—one dwarfed by the size of the demand it is trying to satiate. Across America (but especially in major cities), it still remains incredibly difficult or outright illegal to build new housing of any type. More and more Americans are moving into lower-cost cities in the South and Southeast, but even these places are failing to keep up. The US will still need millions more homes before demand is even close to satiated—and today’s construction boom needs to be placed in the proper context of an acute housing shortage…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://apricitas.substack.com/p/americas-homebuilding-boom-that-isnt">https://apricitas.substack.com/p/americas-homebuilding-boom-that-isnt</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>One further sign that Jack Dorsey was a really bad CEO COHEN he created what appears to have been a very bad Board of Directors for Twitter:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Matt Levine</strong>: <em>Twitter’s Board Gave Up</em>: ‘Ten years ago if you had said that the job of a board of directors was to maximize the stock price, a lot of people would say “well sure yes of course,” but now we have stakeholder capitalism…. The Business Roundtable CEOs want to weigh the interests of all stakeholders and sometimes prefer other stakeholders over shareholders; at least some ESG investors are surely willing to sacrifice financial performance for environmental performance. And then Twitter’s CEO shrugs and says, in effect, “meh look this deal might be bad for our users and employees and product and mission, but we can’t think about that; the price is right and my only duty is to shareholders.” It’s strange! One thing to say about this story is that, as a description of the board’s legal duties, it is debatable.[2] The foundational Delaware hostile-takeover cases from the 1980s explicitly say that a board can consider “the impact on ‘constituencies’ other than shareholders…. What is strange here is that the richest person on earth came in out of the blue with a not-particularly-preemptive offer to buy a service that he is obsessed with and that seems crucial to his success. Hearing that, you might think things like “huh this product must be pretty valuable.” You might sit down and try to think of ways to extract value from it, other than selling it to Musk at the first price he proposed. Twitter’s board had no ideas…. I want to be clear here that I am not saying that it was a bad decision, for Twitter’s product or users, to sell to Elon Musk. I have no idea…. The basic problem with Twitter’s management and board of directors seems to be that they do not care about Twitter, as a company or as a product, so they are left to care about shareholders.

I find that as I age I have less tolerance for economic theory moored only to (a) introspection about human psychology and (b) von Hayekian ideas about the functioning and power of market economies and their “equilibrium” points. (Yes, I know von Hayek did not like static equilibrium, but he would have been more tolerant of dynamic equilibrium concepts.)

Yes, there are people among us—the Solows, Krugmans, Dixits, and so forth—who can use economic theories as very powerful intuition pumps. But they are both geniuses and trained professionals.
