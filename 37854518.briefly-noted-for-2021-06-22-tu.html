The bill is intended to foster the reinvigoration of the manufacturing side of the U.S. technology sector…. The Senate version faces criticism regarding the lack of significant oversight of the technology companies that will benefit from the bill. However, the extent of bipartisan support in the Senate suggests a big enough coalition to survive negotiations between the House and Senate versions…. Both Republican and Democrats displayed an allergy to industrial policy after the 1970s; that both now seem interested in government intervention is a huge change from the long-standing consensus…. Whether this amounts to a new “Cold War Consensus” is altogether uncertain, but the fact that concern over China can bridge one of the most poisonous political divides in U.S. history should probably cause some concern in Beijing…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://thediplomat.com/2021/06/with-focus-on-china-us-senate-passes-major-industrial-policy-bill/">https://thediplomat.com/2021/06/with-focus-on-china-us-senate-passes-major-industrial-policy-bill/</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Shac Ron</strong>:&nbsp;<em>’Arm64 didn’t appear out of nowhere.</em>&nbsp;Apple contracted ARM to design a new ISA for its purposes. When Apple began selling iPhones containing arm64 chips, ARM hadn’t even finished their own core design to license to others. Arm64 is the Apple ISA, it was designed to enable Apple’s microarchitecture plans. There’s a reason Apple’s first 64 bit core (Cyclone) was years ahead of everyone else, and it isn’t just caches. ARM designed a standard that serves its clients and gets feedback from them on ISA evolution. In 2010 few cared about a 64-bit ARM core. Samsung &amp; Qualcomm, the biggest mobile vendors, were certainly caught unaware by it when Apple shipped in 2013. Apple planned to go super-wide with low clocks, highly OoO, highly speculative. They needed an ISA to enable that, which ARM provided. M1 performance is not so because of the ARM ISA, the ARM ISA is so because of Apple core performance plans a decade ago…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://twitter.com/stuntpants/status/1346473074544181249">https://twitter.com/stuntpants/status/1346473074544181249</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>David Glasner</strong>:&nbsp;<em>What’s so Great about Supply-Demand Analysis?</em>: ‘This analysis is the bread and butter of economics…. There is much to be said for the analysis…. But it’s also important to understand its limitations, and, especially, the implicit assumptions… It focuses attention on the idea of an equilibrium price at which all buyers can buy as much as they would like, and all sellers can sell as much as they would like…. That equilibrium price, aside from enabling the mutual compatibility of buyers’ and sellers’ plans to buy or to sell, has optimal properties…. The chief problem with supply-demand analysis is that it requires a strict ceteris-paribus assumption…. But another implicit assumption underlies supply-demand analysis: that the economic system starts from a state of general equilibrium…. Finally, and perhaps most problematic, comparative statics is merely a comparison of two alternative equilibria, neither of which can be regarded as the outcome of a theoretically explicable, much less practical, process leading from initial conditions to the notional equilibrium state…. It’s important to understand [that]… the relationship between the formalism and the real world is tenuous…&nbsp;</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://uneasymoney.com/2021/06/16/whats-so-great-about-supply-demand-analysis/">https://uneasymoney.com/2021/06/16/whats-so-great-about-supply-demand-analysis/</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Ezra Klein&nbsp;</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Interviews Betsey Stevenson</em>: ’"We got three months left of these extra $300 payments.

I think they’re thinking, my job is miserable and I’m going to take this nice time for a break. And I’m going to look right now while I can for something better. And I guarantee you that we could get rid of all of unemployment insurance tomorrow, and we wouldn’t put 7.5 million people back to work overnight…. It might even be OK… appreciate the fact that people have had a really hard year. People who have white collar jobs with good incomes feel like they’ve had a hard year…. Well, if you’re barely putting food on the table, your job became enormously more miserable, and then you turn on the news and you see people yelling at you because you’re not getting back to work fast enough. That’s just a lack of appreciation of the humanity of lower wage workers… If UI is having an effect, it’s small….
