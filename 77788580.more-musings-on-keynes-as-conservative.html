He sees two major flaws in how the system works:</p><ul><li><p>“its failure to provide for full employment…”</p></li><li><p>“its arbitrary and inequitable distribution of wealth and incomes…”</p></li></ul><p>Both can be cured if the government will stabilize aggregate demand at the appropriate relative level by:</p><blockquote><p>exercis[ing] a guiding influence on the propensity to consume partly through its scheme of taxation, partly by fixing the rate of interest, and partly, perhaps, in other ways…. It seems unlikely that the influence of banking policy on the rate of interest will be sufficient by itself…. I conceive, therefore, that a somewhat comprehensive socialisation of investment will prove the only means of securing an approximation to full employment; though this need not exclude all manner of compromises and of devices by which public authority will co-operate with private initiative…</p></blockquote><p>Given this, there is then:</p><blockquote><p>no obvious case… for… State Socialism…. Determin[ing] the aggregate amount of resources devoted to augmenting the instruments and the basic rate of reward to those who own them… accomplishe[s] all that is necessary…</p></blockquote><p>Moreover, solving the problem of full employment also solves the problem of income distribution. Full-employment demand-management policy will be a low interest-rate policy, hence it achieves:</p><blockquote><p>the euthanasia of the rentier… of the cumulative oppressive power of the capitalist to exploit the scarcity-value of capital [to earn] interest… [which] rewards no genuine sacrifice…</p></blockquote><p>And as Keynes sums up:</p><blockquote><p>If our central controls succeed in establishing an aggregate volume of output corresponding to full employment as nearly as is practicable, the classical theory comes into its own…. The result… is not to dispose of the ‘Manchester System’, but to indicate… [what] environment… the free play of economic forces requires…. Then the traditional advantages of individualism will still hold good. Let us stop for a moment to remind ourselves what these advantages are. They are partly advantages of efficiency—the advantages of decentralisation and of the play of self-interest.… Above all, individualism, if it can be purged of its defects and its abuses, is the best safeguard of personal liberty in the sense that, compared with any other system, it greatly widens the field for the exercise of personal choice. It is also the best safeguard of the variety of life, which emerges precisely from this extended field of personal choice, and the loss of which is the greatest of all the losses of the homogeneous or totalitarian state. For this variety preserves the traditions which embody the most secure and successful choices of former generations; it colours the present with the diversification of its fancy; and, being the handmaid of experiment as well as of tradition and of fancy, it is the most powerful instrument to better the future…</p></blockquote><p>Even moderately insightful conservatives recognized that there was a good chance that Keynes was right. Milton Friedman, for example, it was really a Keynesian wolf in classical-libertarian sheep's clothing. He defined a "neutral" monetary policy to be "whatever monetary policy produced an interest rate path consistent with stable, full employment". He hoped that a stable nominal, monetary growth rate for some proper monetary aggregate would do this. But for Friedman, the way you knew that monetary policy had been too tight or too loose. Did not depend on whether some quantitative monetary aggregate under shot or overshot the constant growth path. It, rather, depending on whether there was depression or inflation.</p><p>Milton Friedman's monetary framework consisted therefore of a portfolio of two highly leveraged dynamic bets: (1) that he could sell light-handed Keynesian-type central planning to his ideological allies by pretending that it was actually a “neutral” <em>laissez-faire</em> monetary policy, something like the courts rather than an “interference” with the market; and (2) that contary to Keynes’s guess, “the influence of banking policy on the rate of interest will be sufficient by itself” so “no somewhat comprehensive socialisation of investment” would be required. In the long-run, both of those dynamic bets went spectaculary bankrupt. Hence, while in the long-run Keynes and his ideas are not intellectually dead, Milton Friedman and his ideas are.</p><p>There was one perhaps-insightful conservative critique of Keynesian ideas. It was Jacob Viner’s: that there was no possibility of stabilizing aggregate demand at a full-employment, non-inflationary level for long—that “Keynesianism” could work only as long as in the “constant race between the printing press and the business agents of the trade unions… the printing press could maintain a constant lead…” Businesses, Viner thought, needed either to be flooded with cash or to expect wages to be curbed if they were to invest; the first was inflation, the second required the threat of periodic mass unemployment, and so Keynes’s system could not be stable and successful.</p><p>The jury is, I think, still out on Viner.</p><p>Other than Friedman and his colleagues—who knew very well what they were doing in dressing their Keynesian wolfish selves in libertarian sheep’s clothing—and Viner, however, the reaction of conservatives to Keynes was never one of debate, acceptance, and approval for his offering them a potential way forward. It was, rather, unhinged rage.</p><p>Why was that?</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/more-musings-on-keynes-as-conservative?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/more-musings-on-keynes-as-conservative?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7f94d6-0f5e-4c9b-a4b8-b27068eacae3_2432x2016.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7f94d6-0f5e-4c9b-a4b8-b27068eacae3_2432x2016.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7f94d6-0f5e-4c9b-a4b8-b27068eacae3_2432x2016.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7f94d6-0f5e-4c9b-a4b8-b27068eacae3_2432x2016.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7f94d6-0f5e-4c9b-a4b8-b27068eacae3_2432x2016.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd7f94d6-0f5e-4c9b-a4b8-b27068eacae3_2432x2016.png" width="1456" height="1207" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd7f94d6-0f5e-4c9b-a4b8-b27068eacae3_2432x2016.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1207,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1693222,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7f94d6-0f5e-4c9b-a4b8-b27068eacae3_2432x2016.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7f94d6-0f5e-4c9b-a4b8-b27068eacae3_2432x2016.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7f94d6-0f5e-4c9b-a4b8-b27068eacae3_2432x2016.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd7f94d6-0f5e-4c9b-a4b8-b27068eacae3_2432x2016.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>Must-Reads: <strong>Reviews and Such of </strong><em><strong>Slouching</strong></em><strong>:</strong></h2><p>The past 24-hours’ worth of reactions to my <em>Slouching Towards Utopia</em> &lt;<a href="http://bit.ly/3pP3Krk">bit.ly/3pP3Krk</a>&gt;. Three different very good and very thoughtful and very critical reviews:</p><p><strong>Scott Sumner</strong>: <a href="https://www.econlib.org/brad-delongs-20th-century/">Brad DeLong's 20th century</a>: ‘I am a slow reader and I was dead tired on the final leg of the trip. Yet I somehow managed to finish the entire 540-page book just as I landed in Orange County, which wouldn’t have been possible if DeLong hadn’t written an unusually absorbing account of this period. Everyone else seemed to be watching inflight movies…. DeLong’s real interest is in the way that ideology helped to shape the events of the past 150 years. I’ll focus on areas where I disagree with DeLong, but I agree with most of his analysis.&nbsp; Don’t let my quibbles dissuade you from reading this engrossing narrative…</p><p><strong>Dietz Vollrath</strong>: <a href="https://growthecon.com/feed/2022/10/11/DeLong-Review.html">Review of DeLong's "Slouching Towards Utopia</a>”: ‘It is a necessary book to read if you are at all interested in the subject of economic growth. It is informative and thought-provoking. If you are one of those 50% who have not read it, go do so now…. I’m… interested in is that very relevant and ultimately very <em>necessary</em> change in how population growth responded to living standards that occurred around the same time. What happened around 1870 was not just that productivity growth was able to outpace population growth, but that population growth started to <em>fall</em> in response to increase in productivity. This was a fundamental flip in the typical Malthusian relationship…</p><p><strong>Patrick Luciani: </strong><a href="https://thehub.ca/2022-10-14/patrick-luciani-is-the-age-of-prosperity-over/">Is the age of prosperity over?</a>: ‘Professor DeLong is a polymath who knows much about economics, history, and philosophy, and here his talents are on full display. But talent often comes with a healthy ego…. It’s a fantastic read, if not a bit weird in places with an unapologetic leftist bias. (No surprise here, given that DeLong was inspired by socialist historian Eric Hobsbawm’s classic book on the twentieth century entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Age-Extremes-History-World-1914-1991/dp/0679730052">The Age of Extremes</a><em>,</em> which goes from 1914 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.) In no other book on economic history would you find the poetry of Rudyard Kipling or the colourful career of Herbert Hoover, a description of the neurosis of Nikola Tesla or witty allusions to Greek mythology.
