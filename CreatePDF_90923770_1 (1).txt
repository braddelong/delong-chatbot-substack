The New Inflation Picture

J. BRADFORD DELONG

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the bond market's 5-10 year projection of annual 
chain-weighted personal-consumption-expenditures inflation reached 2.27%, raising concerns that 
another big shock could de-anchor inflation expectations. But since that didn't happen, the Federal 
Reserve now should reconsider its position.

BERKELEY a€“ At the start of February 2022, the five-year, five-year-forward consumer-price-index 
(CPI) inflation break-even rate in the US bond market was hovering at around 2% per year a€“ a 
figure that corresponds to a chain-weighted personal-consumption-expenditures (PCE) inflation 
forecast of 1.6% per year 5-10 years from now. Since 1.6% inflation is materially below the US 
Federal Reservea€™ s 2%
target, I entered that month feeling quite good about being on a€oeTeam Transitorya€D a€“ or at 
least on a€oeTeam The Fed Has Got Thisa€D or a€oeTeam Inflation Expectations Remain Solidly 
Anchored.a€D

But then, at the end of that month, Russian President Vladimir Putin a€“ the wannabe Grand Prince 
of Muscovy a€“ ordered a blitzkrieg invasion of Ukraine. Things did not go as he had planned. The 
Ukrainians fended off the initial onslaught, and both sides settled in for a longer war of 
attrition. Energy, grain, and fertilizer prices skyrocketed. The world began to worry that, come 
winter, Europe would freeze and many
other countries a€“ from Egypt to Nigeria a€“ would starve.

Owing to these fears, the five-year, five-year-forward CPI inflation rate shot up from 2% per year 
to its peak of 2.67% on April 21,2022, while expectations of annual PCE inflation 5-10 years hence 
reached 2.27%. That PCE projection suggested that bond traders had not lost confidence in the 
Feda€™ s commitment to its inflation target.

But if one supposes that the width of the Feda€™ s target zone is 0.6 percentage points a€“ meaning 
the bond market expects the central bank to remain on target if five-year, five-year-forward CPI 
inflation remains between 2% and 2.6% a€“ that April 2022 peak raised concerns. For those whose 
hair was already on fire, there was every reason to fear that we were just one more big supply 
shock away from losing the
inflation-expectations anchor that has kept prices relatively stable for decades.

Perhaps we were. But since we did not get that additional large adverse supply shock, it hardly 
matters now. The PCE-chain inflation rate for November was just 0.16%, which is less than 2% per 
year when multiplied by 12. To be sure, one swallow does not make a summer, and one data point does 
not make a trend. Even the decline from 0.62% in June (7% per year) is not necessarily bankable. 
After all, we also saw some
declines between December 2021 and April 2022, and between August 2021 and December 2021.

As I have said before, this pandemic business cycle has been one of those rare periods when I have 
not envied the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). What they do over the next six 
months will not really affect the real economy of demand, employment, and production until one year 
from now, and it will not meaningfully affect the inflation news until a year and a half from now. 
There will be many
new developments over the next 18 months a€“ some of them good, and some of them bad.

Regardless of what the Fed decides to do, it is almost certain to have some regrets afterwards. 
Will it continue to overdo interest-rate hikes? If so, the economy, two years from now, will be 
mired once again in secular stagnation a€“ with interest rates at their zero lower bound, and no 
visible path for a rapid return to full employment. Will the economy achieve a a€oesoft landinga€D 
through immaculate disinflation, or will
additional supply shocks and political pressures throw us into stagflation and a painful and 
prolonged recession?

Nobody knows. But if I was on the FOMC right now, I would keep two considerations in mind. First, 
the Fed does not have to move slowly. The past six months have shown that there are very few 
downsides to rapid monetary-policy changes. Until this month, the Fed was raising interest rates by 
a massive 75 basis points at a time, and even that rate is not a speed limit. The FOMC should take 
advantage of this apparent
optionality. When the situation is unclear, it can pause, confident in the knowledge that it can 
then move very fast when the situation becomes clear.

Second, in retrospect, former Fed Chair Alan GreenspanaC™ s 1996 decision to set the inflation 
target at 2% per year was very ill advised. Yes, there may be substantial benefits from maintaining 
and strengthening the Feda€™ s credibility by getting the economy back to the 2% annual target, 
even if that target will be raised in the medium term. But is that really the kind of credibility 
the Fed wants to have? Is it good for
markets to think that you will persist with policies that no longer fit new circumstances, just 
because you said you would?

Once again, I do not envy the members of the FOMC this winter.
