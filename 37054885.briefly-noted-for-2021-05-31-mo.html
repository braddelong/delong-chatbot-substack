But ultimately free-market Keynesian, even disguised with a monetarist mask, wasn’t sustainable…&lt;<a href="https://t.co/MCuyiMwXCg">https://t.co/MCuyiMwXCg</a>&gt;: </p><p><strong>Jim Beller</strong>: Having his disciples throwing people out of airplanes was a bad look.</p><p><strong>Brad DeLong</strong>: But, as you note, Bernanke in 2002 and Mankiw in 2006 still saw Friedman as “the economist of the century” &lt;<a href="https://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/milton-friedman.html">https://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/milton-friedman.html</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="https://federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/">https://federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/</a>&gt;. They were fine with the “government should not interfere with the economy” and “whatever is the monetary policy that happens to stabilize aggregate demand is the true non-interfering ‘neutral’ monetary policy”. It was a con, yes, but it was a successful con. And it is not clear that it was wrong as a practical policy position…. </p><p>After all, are JM Keynes (macro)-Henry Simons (antitrust)-AC Pigou (externalities) that far from what you or I believe, or what Milton Friedman believed—or, at least, would graciously concede in his old age in outdoor lunch in North Beach if I could get him off of his hobbyhorses of ‘k% rule’ &amp; ‘government failure is almost always certain to be worse than market failure’?</p><p>The way you put it in your 2013 piece is like this: “If markets can go so wrong that they cause Great Depressions, how can you be a free-market true believer on everything except macro? And as American conservatism moved ever further right, it had no room for any kind of interventionism, not even the sterilized, clean-room interventionism of Friedman’s monetarism”.&nbsp;</p><p>I think that is (a) right, (b) much too compressed, but (c) ignores the problem of “where do you stop?” Having the government establish &amp; maintain a property-rights order &amp; enforce contracts is, after all, a form of “interference” to the anarcho-capitalists. So why is police &amp; courts acceptable, while police &amp; courts &amp; demand management is not?</p><p>I think it has something to do with Schumpeter, von Hayek, and von Mises and the context of early–20th center Vienna, with the idea that humans are individuals for whom private property and one-shot exchange are “natural” (as opposed to creatures that establish and cement societal bonds via ongoing reciprocal gift-exchange relationships), with the philosophical position that all is for the best in this the best of all possible worlds, and the resulting theological belief that “the market giveth; the market taketh away; blessed be the name of the market”. In short, I think you are right, but I do not understand why you are right. And here I know I am out of my depth, and I want to call for people like Emma Rothschild and Glory Liu who are trained professionals to help here, for they she might be able to teacheth me the lesson…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-05-31-mo?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-05-31-mo?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p>What Youtube was made for:</p><blockquote><p>Tico &amp; the Man: Psycho-Killer &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mQYn5txqc0&amp;list=UUGFbXza-uSFzUjXlQbCerFg&amp;index=19">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mQYn5txqc0&amp;list=UUGFbXza-uSFzUjXlQbCerFg&amp;index=19</a>&gt;</p><div id="youtube2-4mQYn5txqc0" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;4mQYn5txqc0&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4mQYn5txqc0?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Craig Freedman</strong>:&nbsp;<em>George Stigler’s Rhetoric: Dreams of Martin Luther</em>: &lt;<a href="https://research-management.mq.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/17438115/mq-9168-Author+final+version.pdf">https://research-management.mq.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/17438115/mq-9168-Author+final+version.pdf</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>George J.

It makes predictions—that the competitive market place will provide "to many" varieties, the firms have power to choose at what price they will sell, and that the market as a whole will be in efficient with each variety produced at too small a scale in order to generate quasi-rents but with all the quasi-rents dissipated as a result of entry. Those predictions seem to be, well, true. And Stigler's "demolition" seems to have consisted of saying sometimes saying that monopolistic competition should be rejected on methodological-pragmatic grounds because it did not make predictions significantly different from the competitive model (which was false), and sometimes saying that the model failed internal tests of logical consistency (which all models must: they are maps, not territories, and have seams where the different pieces of the map adjoin):</p><blockquote><p><strong>Thomas Sowell</strong>:&nbsp;<em>A Student’s Eye View of George Stigler</em>: ‘In the winter quarter, I enrolled for my first course under Stigler. It was “industrial organization”…. Few, if any, areas of economics have as much confusion, circular reasoning, definitional traps, and fervent nonsense as industrial organization. It was the perfect place for Stigler to conduct a Demolition Derby. Nor was he hesitant about the task. Theories like “monopolistic competition” and “countervailing power,” which were treated reverently at Harvard (where they originated), were eviscerated by Stigler…. When shattering theories with gusto, Stigler seemed utterly uninhibited by the question, “But what would you put in its place?” Nor should he have been. When the emperor has no clothes, you don’t wait until you can design a whole wardrobe before saying so. In academia, saying that the emperor has no clothes can be a full-time occupation. The regularity with which high-sounding nonsense erupts among intellectuals is like that of Old Faithful, with perhaps not as long an interval in between intellectual geysers.… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/pdf/2138594.pdf">https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/pdf/2138594.pdf</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Ah.

That is the kind that reduces worker well-being:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Noah Smith</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Why Do People Hate Inflation?</em>: ‘I don’t think we should be panicking about inflation yet. But… why do we even care… in the first place?… Inflation really made people very very upset from maybe around 1974 to around 1983. That roughly coincides with when inflation was actually high in America…. When you look at a graph of nominal wages, it sure looks like inflation doesn’t affect it very much…. Now look at a graph of real wages! It’s all over the place!… It sure looks like nominal wages are sticky, meaning that inflation—if it happens for the wrong reasons—can reduce workers’ wages and real purchasing power….. Why is it so hard for workers to negotiate cost-of-living raises? Why was this so hard even in the late 60s and 70s, when unions were much stronger than they are today? What is broken in our wage-setting process? If we can answer that question, we might have a chance of fixing it… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-do-people-hate-inflation">https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-do-people-hate-inflation</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Only if you make people think that liberals are the enemy can you engage your base’s passions while getting them to ignore their interests, and so make them feel pleased that you are picking their pockets:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Alan Wolfe</strong>&nbsp;(2004):&nbsp;<em>A Fascist Philosopher Helps Us Understand Contemporary Politics</em>: ‘Liberals think of politics as a means; conservatives as an end.

Liberals think of conservatives as potential future allies; conservatives treat liberals as unworthy of recognition. Liberals believe policies ought to be judged against an independent ideal such as human welfare or the greatest good for the greatest number; conservatives evaluate policies by whether they advance their conservative causes. Liberals instinctively want to dampen passions; conservatives are bent on inflaming them. Liberals think there is a third way between liberalism and conservatism; conservatives believe that anyone who is not a conservative is a liberal.

[But] a bubble term needs to be added… Japanese experience provides a nice case study…. Countries can have a primary deficit all the time… if the interest rate on the government bond is smaller than the growth rate of the economy…. Interest is low if the government debt is a safe asset, i.e. it allows precautionary self-insurance via retrading and gains in value in times of recessions…. The risk-free rate for a log-utility setting is the sum of the time preference rate (valuing future utility), the expected growth of consumption (higher rates for future wealth), and negative precautionary savings components consisting of the variance of aggregate and idiosyncratic consumption growth risk.
