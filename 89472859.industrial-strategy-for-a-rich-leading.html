Global Warming”, by Stable Diffusion via NightCafe.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The smart Yakov Feigin points out that almost none of the literature on successful industrial policy applies to an economic-leader country. It is all, since the days of Alexander Hamilton, about how to be at best a fast second. The problems of pushing forward the technological frontier and then applying it are much more difficult.</p><p>Moreover, the experience of Japan suggests that institutions and practices that are very good at generating fast-followership and catch-up flop on their face when even a highly competent and technocratic government attempts to direct the process of innovation and frontier development.</p><p>Can we do more than simply throw huge bushels of money in the general direction of as many kinds of institutions as we can think of that might have purchase on the problem? That would be a depressing conclusion. That may be what we should do—we are, after all, massively certain that we are underinvesting in R&amp;D and then downstream in technology deployment:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Yakov Feigin: </strong><a href="https://building-a-ruin.ghost.io/problems-of-an-american-industrial-policy-i/?ref=building-a-ruin-newsletter">Problems of an American Industrial Strategy I: Kindleberger's Dilemma and the Development State</a>: ‘Gerschenkron's most famous idea is that states that are “backward”… have an advantage in achieving rapid growth.… You have a large population that is effectively under-employed in a low-productivity sector…. If the technology is already known… there are <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp1371.pdf">problems</a> that they will hit along the way and a challenging political economy, but let's leave it at that. There is no equivalent theory for an advanced, developed country like the United States. Moreover, no theory can account for the unique features of the American economy vis-a-vis the rest of the world. Many of us who advocate for industrial policy see it as a way to quickly upgrade our capital stock to the challenge of climate change and geopolitical threats. As of yet, we have had no theory about how to do this in a country where you already have the world's largest economy. At most, what we have is a theory of innovation….</p><p>The East Asian developmental model… land reform first… entering world markets… giv[ing] your firms more experience and, most importantly, the feedback of a market where they are not as protected…. Successful developmental states use market prices generated by consumer demand for feedback. <a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/reviews/trade-wars/">Michael Pettis</a> describes this as exporting their forced savings and importing foreign demand!…</p></blockquote><p>And Yakov has another very interesting thing to say:</p><blockquote><p>Kindleberger[’s] system of hegemonic stability requires that the country at the top of the hierarchy accept… free ridership…. It can spend as much as it wants and tell bond vigilantes to shove it where the sun doesn't shine…. Yet… you need to open your capital and current accounts… lose the ability to have substantial control over the real economy and its growth…. I call the Kindleberger dilemma the tradeoff between monetary and real-side sovereignty…. If you try to make the US a trade superpower, you will have to decrease American consumption and export the surplus. This breaks the bank, and the world descends into depression and instability…</p></blockquote><p>Which is primary? Maintaining a global trade-and-development system aimed at helping the world gallop toward peace-and-prosperity? Or grabbing the lion’s share of the gains from new technologies for one’s own people? Over the long 20th century, so much of the second was happening anyway in the United States, because of the existing pattern of industrial and technological development, that the United States could, for much of the era, focus on the first. But I see no reason to think that that is true any more.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>MUST-READ: <strong>Þe Balance of Risks Is Þt þe Fed Has Now Overdone It:</strong></h2><p>It is, IMHO, touch-and-go with respect to whether we will be able to avoid another round of secular stagnation with interest rates at their zero lower bound:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Colby Smith &amp; Caitlin Gilbert: </strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c2d4d4b5-cbc8-4b5c-9ea3-44e9742d5b3a">US unemployment rate set to surpass 5.5%, economists predict</a>: <em>FT/IGM poll suggests waning optimism the Fed can tame inflation without causing material job losses Of the 45 economists surveyed, 85% project that the National Bureau of Economic Research — the arbiter of when recessions begin and end — will declare one by next year</em>: ‘Despite Fed chair Jay Powell’s and other top officials’ insistence that a “soft or softish landing” is possible given the historically tight labour market, the bulk of the economists polled see a period of pain on the horizon…. “A soft landing is extremely difficult and it almost never happens in history,” said Giorgio Primiceri… An overwhelming majority see the central bank wrapping up its rate rises in or before the second quarter of next year and for the bulk of the economic effects to be felt in the latter half of 2023 or early 2024…. Brad DeLong, a survey participant at the University of California, Berkeley, said he is far more confident today that price pressures are not becoming entrenched in the economy, not least because expectations of future inflation still remain under control. The bigger concern, he said, is the Fed overreacting at this stage and causing unnecessary&nbsp;economic damage. “The major risk is on the downside — that the Federal Reserve overdoes it and we wind up back in secular stagnation with interest rates back at zero and no one able to get the economy moving again”…</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/industrial-strategy-for-a-rich-leading/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/industrial-strategy-for-a-rich-leading/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>ONE VIDEO: <strong>Immersed!:</strong></h2><p>I’m starting to really want my Apple AR headset:</p><div id="youtube2-LRKPH-N-ca8" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;LRKPH-N-ca8&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LRKPH-N-ca8?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>ONE IMAGE: <strong>I Appreciate Ian Morris’s Trying to Do Þis, But…: </strong></h2><p>Isn’t “energy capture” after the year -2000 largely wheat vs. rice?
