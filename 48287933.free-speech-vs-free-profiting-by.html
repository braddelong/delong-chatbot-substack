It, rightly, is a very powerful value only to those who glee in hacking for profit the brains of their users to their detriment.</p><p>Spotify having Joe Rogan in its podcast directory is free speech. Apple having Joe Rogan in its podcast directory is free speech. Overcast having Joe Rogan in its podcast directory is free speech. If Apple were to delete Joe Rogan from its podcast directory, if Overcast were to delete Joe Rogan from its podcast directory, I would be upset.</p><p>What’s that? You say you Joe Rogan has been deleted from the Apple Podcasts directory? You say Joe Rogan has been deleted from the Overcast podcast directory? </p><p>What dastardly creature has committed such a violation of free-speech norms? </p><p>What’s that? You say <em>Spotify</em> has deprived Joe Rogan of his ability to reach those who want to hear him who use Apple Podcasts or Overcast, or another non-Spotify mode of access? <em>Spotify</em> has cancelled him from the Apple and Overcast directories? </p><p>You say <em>Spotify </em>has paid Joe Rogan in the nine figures, has blocked his podcasts from Apple and Overcast and other non-Spotify listeners, and made his podcasts Spotify exclusives? You say that Spotify then wants to spend money like water, saying: YOU MUST LISTEN ON SPOTIFY! ONLY ON SPOTIFY CAN YOU GET JOE ROGAN!! AND YOU REALLY WANT TO LISTEN TO JOE ROGAN BECAUSE HE TELLS YOU SO MANY LIES ABOUT COVID!!!! PLUS ADDED BONUS RACISM!!!!! </p><p>Spending dollars by the tens of millions to attract viewers to people who will lie to them so that you can profit massively—and not because you think they have a message that needs to be heard—is not the first, an exercise of free speech, but rather the  second. It is a grift. It is a con. It is hacking the brains of your listeners to their detriment. Daniel Ek at Spotify knows damned well that grabbing an exclusive on Joe Rogan and then trying as hard as they can to boost the number of people he misinforms and whose brains they hack is not “free speech”. But he knows also that he may be able to ride this one out if he can throw enough chaff in the air and get enough useful idiots to say that Spotify is defending free speech by trying to maximally monetize Joe Rogan’s podcast exclusive. And Ben Thompson has fallen for it:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ben Thompson</strong>: <em>Spotify and Joe Rogan, Culture and Principles, Music Versus Podcasts &amp; the Long Run</em>: ‘Ek is right—the slope is slippery—and the fact of the matter is that we are, at least in terms of the elite culture dominated by U.S. media, at the bottom of the hill. Yes, the First Amendment still exists as a law, but it is hard to argue free expression still exists as a value. In other words, while it used to be the case that simply declaring that you were in favor of free speech was enough to tamp down most controversies, particularly in terms of comedians or edgy personalities, today one is quickly mired in the exact sort of muck I noted above, trying to defend broad principles while distancing oneself from specific examples. It’s an impossible dance, and—not to defend any specific instances of speech (here I dance)—I’m not sure we have yet fully internalized the long-term costs of no longer accepting free speech as a blanket principle citable by everyone from cranks to CEOs. One implication of this observation is that Ek perhaps wishes he had realized it in 2020, before Spotify brought Rogan on board; the podcasts where Rogan used a slur were already part of his catalog, and while Spotify may have thought that podcasts that had existed for years without controversy were covered under the sort of “We support free speech” defense that used to be commonplace, the company might have acted differently had it realized that that defense is, in many quarters, no longer valid…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/spotify-and-joe-rogan-culture-and-principles-music-versus-podcasts-and-the-long-run/">https://stratechery.com/2022/spotify-and-joe-rogan-culture-and-principles-music-versus-podcasts-and-the-long-run/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video</h2><p><strong>Aaron Rupar</strong>: <em>Marco Rubio’s Incredible Cowardice, in One Video Clip</em>: ‘Trump’s one-time critic now won’t even admit it was wrong for the former president to try to overturn his election loss:</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:48322516,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://aaronrupar.substack.com/p/marco-rubio-trump-pence-overturning-elections&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:501423,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Public Notice&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cb5157cc-b073-4ed0-882b-3cd094772cad_1280x1280.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Marco Rubio's incredible cowardice, in one video clip&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;In the span of six years, Sen.

They include the young and the less educated, as well as those who work in lower-wage industries and perform blue-collar tasks. Many are based in the South. Wealthier, older, college-educated professionals in other parts of the country are also making gains. Wages are rising, and just about anyone who wants a job can get one in certain industries.

The U.S. economy created 467,000 jobs in January, more than triple the 125,000 that economists had anticipated. According to the most recent data, the economy created 700,000 more jobs at the end of last year than previously believed…. Compared with the federal government’s response to the 2008 financial crisis, the recovery from the COVID–19 crash has been an extraordinary success…. It remains difficult to find intellectuals or policy makers eager to take credit for these triumphs. This silence is especially noticeable on the left, which can reasonably claim much of the change in approach as its own…. Most of the conversation about the economy today is not about manufacturing jobs, strike activity, or quit rates. It’s about inflation…. Highlighting the strength of the job market may or may not be a winning message for politicians, but it’s essential for understanding both the calamity we avoided and how to respond…. The Great Recession was a generational cataclysm for the American middle class. The COVID–19 recession has not been, because policy makers have prioritized the benefits of a high-demand economy over the risk of moderately rising prices.

Writing in the American Conservative this week, Matthew Schmitz invokes Sam Francis as a guide to the contemporary American Right…. He proposes that a new crop radical right intellectuals has a genuine and organic constituency in the historic core of the conservative movement: It has a deep and abiding base of popular support in what Sam Francis called the “post-bourgeois proletariat,” people who live in, but are not fully part of, our managerial regime…. Francis described the beliefs of the post-bourgeois proletariat…. They show “little attraction to bourgeois conservatism and its emphasis on laissez-faire economics, the rights of property, [and] the minimal state.” These ideas supported and were supported by a bourgeois order that the rise of large organizations—the so-called managerial revolution—has displaced…. Sam Francis is really the clearest and most-honest guide to the present disposition of the Right…. Francis understood this “dispossessed people” in racial terms, and became increasingly explicit about it…. Francis here was borrowing from Georges Sorel, a name whom readers of Unpopular Front will recognize. Sorel believed that political movements required animating myths, which were not rational programs or explicitly articulated ideologies, but expressions of the group’s inner convictions…. I’d argue that the Right already has just such a myth in the stolen election conspiracy theory. It is not subject to refutation with facts and it is primarily the story of dispossession of “the true nation” at the hands of an alien Other…</p><p>LINK: </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:48298599,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://johnganz.substack.com/p/looking-for-an-american-myth&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:112019,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Unpopular Front&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e2ad597-1a1e-4c5b-be30-d37b49502770_1224x1224.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Looking for an American Myth&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;One reflection of the political and social crisis in the country is the on-going battle of over myths of national origin and purpose.
