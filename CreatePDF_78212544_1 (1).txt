Zach Carter: Review of Slouching for Dissent: a€~Slouching Towards Utopia<U\\.,ly/3pP3Krk> is a 
rise-and-fall epica€”but it is better at depicting the rise than explaining the fall. There is a 
masterpiece in J.
Bradford DeLonga€™ s Slouching Towards Utopia, and a very interesting muddlea€!. In the a€oelong 
twentieth centurya€Da€’’the period between 1870 and 2010a€”an almost miraculous transformation took
placea€!. Humans did not find utopia, DeLong argues, but we stumbled in its general directiona€!. 
His narrative is fundamentally hopeful: people can accomplish amazing things on a colossal scale. 
Not that long ago,
we  did so all the time. This perspective is refreshing precisely because everyone, DeLong 
included, knows that something has gone terribly wronga€!
