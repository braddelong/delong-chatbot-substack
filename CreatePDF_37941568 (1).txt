In a month and a half, in the 50% vaccinated UK, the delta variant went from 100 to 6000 cases a 
daya€”a growth rate of 10% per day with substantial social distancing still in effect and with a 
half-vaccinated country. This thing is likely to rip through the less-vaccinated parts of the 
United States without the strong social-distancing measures that Red States were never able or 
willing to implement in the first place:

Paragraphs:

Zachary Carter: The Second Death of Milton Friedman'. a€~the secret to Friedmana€™ s success in the 
world of ideas was his ability to influence American liberalsa€! Rank-and-file conservative voters 
simply didna€™t buy what Friedman was sellinga€!. Friedman argued that a free market economy 
liberated from every possible stricture of government oversight would serve as an effective way to 
root out racism from
American societya€! [as] racist policies would put the companies that practiced them at a 
competitive disadvantage^!. Not many conservatives believed it back in the 1960s, either. Goldwater 
supporters didna€™ t back him because they expected him to wage a more rigorous crusade for racial 
justice than President Lyndon B. Johnsona€”they pulled the lever for Goldwater because they thought 
he would uphold the Jim
Crow social ordera€!. [But] by persuading a good chunk of his political opponents that he shared 
their values and social goals, Friedman built support for a policy program that ultimately 
undermined those very liberal objectives. Democratsa€! did adopt much of his economic worldview, 
believing it could be adapted to the partya€™ s broader social agenda. The ring of power did not 
have to be destroyed, but could be
harnessed for progressive purposesa€!

Ezra Klein: Maybe Joe Manchin Knows Exactly What Hea€™ s Doing'. a€~Manchina€! is circulating a 
compromise voting rights memo that he believes could serve as the basis for a bipartisan bill. 
Ita€! bans partisan gerrymandering, restores key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, makes 
Election Day a public holiday and puts in place automatic voter registration^! [while] mandating 
that voters show certain forms of
identification. But the question Manchin faces isna€™ t whether therea€™ s a voting rights bill he 
can support. Ita€™ s whether hea€™ s willing to force Republicans to accept ita€!. Manchin could 
offer both sides a choice: a bipartisan bill designed by Manchin (and whatever allies he chooses) 
or the outcome on voting rights they fear mosta€”for Democrats, that would be nothing, and for 
Republicans, that would be
everythinga€!. Core to this strategy is Manchin admitting something he often pretends not to see: 
It is not in the Republican Partya€™ s interest to cooperate with Democrats on major legislation. 
Republicans would prefer to pass nothing and watch Joe Bidena€™ s presidency fail. This is not my 
supposition or slander. This is their own testimony. a€oeMitch McConnella€™ s come under a lot of 
criticism for saying at one
point    he wanted to make sure that Barack Obama was a one-term president,a€D Senator John 
Barrasso, a member of the Republicansa€™ Senate leadership team, said. a€oel want to make Joe Biden 
a one-half-term president.a€D Just as Manchin believes he needs to force Democrats to agree to 
compromise bills, so too does he need to force Republicans to agree to those billsa€!. If Manchin 
allows Republicans to kill any
bill they do not choose to support, he will be strengthening their incentives for partisanship^!

Abraham Lincoln: At Alton, IL: a€~That is the real issue. That is the issue that will continue in 
this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be silent. It is the eternal 
struggle between these two principles a€“ right and wrong a€“ throughout the world. They are the 
two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time, and will ever continue to 
struggle. The one is the common
right of humanity and the other the divine right of kings. It is the same principle in whatever 
shape it develops itself. It is the same spirit that says, a€~You work and toil and earn bread, and 
Ia€™ 11 eat it.a€™ No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to 
bestride the people of his own nation and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men 
as an apology for enslaving another
race, it is the same tyrannical principlea€!

Matthew A. Winkler: California Defies Doom With No. 1 U.S. Economy. a€~The Golden State has no 
peers when it comes to expanding GDP, raising household income, investing in innovation and a host 
of other key metricsa€!.If anything, Covida€‘T9 accelerated Californiaa€™ s record productivity. 
Quarterly revenue per employee of the publicly-traded companies based in the state climbed to an 
all-time high of $1.5
million in May, 63% greater than its similar milestone a decade ago, according to data compiled by 
Bloomberg. The rest of the U.S. was nothing special, with productivity among those members of the 
Russell 3000 Index, which is made up of both large and small companies, little changed during the 
past 10 yearsa€!. While pundits have long insisted California policies are bad for business, 
reality belies them. In a sign of
investor demand, the weight of California companies in the benchmark S&P 500 Index increased 3 
percentage points since a year ago, the most among all states, according to data compiled by 
Bloomberg. Faith in California credit was similarly superlative, with the weight of corporate bonds 
sold by companies based in the state rising the most among all states, to 12.5 percentage points 
from 11.7 percentage points, according
to  the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Bond Index. Translation: Investors had the greatest 
confidence in California companies during the pandemic. The most trusted measure of economic 
strength says California is the world-beater among democracies. The statea€™ s gross domestic 
product increased 21% during the past five years, dwarfing No. 2 New York (14%) and No. 3 Texas 
(12%), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg .a€!

Adam Tooze: Chartbook Newsletter #21: a€~Reading Grossmana€™ s Stalingrad and Life and Fate^\. 
Jameson puts it as follows: a€oeas paradoxical as it may sound, what holds his novel together as a 
unified narrative is also what holds the Soviet Union together in this period, the unfreedom that 
allowed it, improbably, to defeat Hitlera€™ s Wehrmacht and win World War II.a€D The only question 
is, why
a€oeimprobablya€n? That casual suggestion of contingency is not innocent. It concedes far too much 
to Western condescension, to the British and American intelligence analysts who scoffed at Soviet 
production statistics, to the German generals who bemoaned the victories supposedly stolen from 
them by Hitlera€™ s meddling. It mistakes the essential point. What Stalingrad demonstrated was 
precisely that the
unfreedom                                                                                           
                                                                                                    
     of the Soviet Union, as terrible as it was, was different from that of Nazi Germany or for 
that matter of the West precisely because it was more historically generative, more potent. It 
wrought a material, social and cultural transformation on such a vast scale that it overturned the 
presumptions of historical normality. It shifted the balance of probabilities. It made it probable, 
not improbable, that the Soviet Union
would win World War II. Certainly, that is the view of Grossman and his charactersa€!
