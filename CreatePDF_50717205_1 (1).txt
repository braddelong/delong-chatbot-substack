[Edward Bellamy] throws his narrator-protagonist forward in time, from 1887 to 2000, to marvel at a 
rich, well-functioning society. At one point the narrator-protagonist is asked if he would like to 
hear some music. He expects his hostess to play the piano.

Bellamy's point is going to be that the technological marvels of the year-2000 allow for the 
incredible amplification of even the wonders of civilizationa€”in this case, the wonder of 
civilization that is the incredible versatile piano. This alone would be testament to a vast leap 
forward. To listen to middle-class music on demand in around 1900 you had to havea€”in your house 
or nearbya€”an instrument, and someone trained to play it. It would have cost the
average worker some 2,400 hours, roughly a year at a 50-hour workweek, to earn the money to buy a 
high-quality pianoforte. Then there would be the expense and the time committed to piano lessons." 
Listening to middle-class moderate-quality music in your house was a privilege reserved to the 
rich. It was something that Edward Bellamy dreamed would be democratized in the world of 
technological abundance and human solidarity that he dreamed that the
year 2000 would see. Anyone could listen to music in their house! And not just the performance of 
one amateur performer! Professional music, orchestral musica€”and you would have a choice of one of 
four currently-playing orchestras that you could dial up on your speakerphone. That was what Edward 
Bellamy chose as his example of the wonders of human flourishing that technology and solidarity, 
the utopia that he thought was hidden in the womb of the
then-present.

We have far exceeded his hopes of technology. We have fallen far short of what he thought would be 
the development of solidarity. And where moon? When Lambo? Where utopia?

But Bellamya€™ s narrator-protagonist is awed when .his hostess does not sit down at the pianoforte 
to amuse him. Instead, she a€oemerely touched one or two screws,a€D and immediately the room was 
a€oefilled with music; filled, not flooded, for, by some means, the volume of melody had been 
perfectly graduated to the size of the apartment. a€~Grand!a€™ I cried. a€~Bach must be at the keys 
of that organ; but where is the organ?
a€™

Where indeed? In 1884 the Atlanta telephone exchange served over 300 customersa€’’albeit at very 
low fidelity. (Also: "gramophone" was trademarked in 1887.) But Bellamy's is the first mention I 
know of as using the telephone network for broadcasting one-to-many provision of services to people 
not gathered in a concert hall.

[Edward Bellamya€™ s narrator-protagonist .in Looking Backward: 2000-1887] learns that his host has 
dialed up, on her telephone landline, a live orchestra, and she has put it on the speakerphone. In 
Bellamya€™ s utopia, you see, you can dial up a local orchestra and listen to it play live. But 
wait. It gets more impressive. He further learns he has a choice. His hostess could dial up one of 
four orchestras currently playing. The
narratora€™ s reaction? a€oelf we [in the 1800s] could have devised an arrangement for providing 
everybody with music in their homes perfect in quality, unlimited in quantity, suited to every 
mood, and beginning and ceasing at will, we should have considered the limit of human felicity 
already attained.a€D

Think of that: the limit of human felicity. That is the most that Bellamy thinks he can demand of 
technology in terms of promoting human flourishing and comfort: that you have a choice of which 
orchestra you can dial up on your speakerphone. That is the limit of his imagination. Oh. And his 
characters have Amazon Primea€”but they have to go to showrooms rather than browse the internet. 
And they go out to eat rather than cooking at home. And nobody is
overworked. And everyone is middle-class.

FN LAN 2000


Thus the thing that strikes me most about Edward Bellamy's year-2000 utopia of common purpose and 
material abundance is both how less in the way of technological prowess it requires than we have 
today, and yet how far we still are from it psychologically. "The limit of human felicity". Think 
of that.

Utopias are, by definition, the end-all and.be-all. a€oeAn imagined place or state of things in 
which everyone is perfected: so says Oxford Reference. Much of human history has been spent in 
disastrous flirtations with ideals of perfection of many varieties. Utopian imaginings during the 
long twentieth century were responsible for its most shocking grotesqueries. Citing a quotation 
from the eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel
Kanta€”a€oeout of the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing was ever madea€Da€”the 
philosopher-historian Isaiah Berlin concluded a€oeand for that reason no perfect solution is, not 
merely in practice, but in principle, possible in human affairs,a€D Berlin went on to write, 
a€oeany determined attempt to produce it is likely to lead to suffering, disillusionment, and 
failure.a€D This observationalso points to why I see the long
twentieth century as most fundamentally economic. For all its uneven benefits, for all its 
expanding human felicity without ever reaching its limit, for all its manifest imperfections, 
economics during the twentieth century has worked just shy of miracles.

Berlin's translation of Kant may not be completely honesta€”your mileage may vary. Kant's "Aus so 
krummem Holze, als woraus der Mensch gemacht ist, kann nichts ganz Gerades gezimmert werden" Kant 
has a sense of imperfectiona€”the things that cannot be made are not "completely straight things": 
there must be compromises with the  reality imposed by thematerial of which society isbuilt up. 
Berlin, by contrast, hassimply "straight things", and the
sense is not of imperfection but of failure. Indeed, Berlin'sentire career can be seen as one long 
sustained argument that government in particular and human collective action in general should be 
confined to the very narrow sphere of simply trying to establish tolerance, so that each can sit 
under his vine and fig tree, and not be afraid.

Freedom from fear is, yes, very important, and an essential part of it is freedom of worship. 
Freedom of speech can also be seen as part of the vine-fig-peace trinity of bare stripped thin 
liberalism. But there is also, in FDR's.taxonomy, freedom from want. John Stuart Mill rejected the 
firm divide Isaiah Berlin wanted to draw between good "negative" and bad so-called "positive" 
liberty. Society needs to arrange  things so that everyone in fact has their own vine
and fig tree. Lacking those, people, no matter how much negative liberty they have, are condemned 
to "the same li[ves] of drudgery and imprisonment".

But let us accept Berlin's broadening from "completely straight" to simply "straight". There is an 
important and valid insight to be gained here: Edward Bellamy was all but sure that with the 
technological marvels he saw the 20th century as likely to bring and with the human solidarity that 
had led 400,000 young men to go South and die in the decisive push to free 5 million slaves, it 
should be simple and straightforward to build for humanity a real utopia by
2000. But: crooked timber. Technology enables people to make more and more sophisticated things. 
And one the things people are best at making is, in the words of the brilliant late novelist Iain 
M. Banks, is "their own unhappiness".

Utopian aspirations, many of them based on ideas of how to organize society's division of labor, 
have been the source of much misery in the 20th century when people attempt to put them into 
practicea€”to force people to become a straight thing. "We need to replace the anarchy of the 
market with a society that takes direction from a Leader" was one such, and the worst such when the 
Leader's directions were to exterminate Jews, kill Slavs and herd those
whosurvived into concentration camps, all so that German farmers could be fruitful, multiplying, 
and flourishing on large farms with black earth. But only slightly behind was the idea that we need 
to replace the anarchy of the market with one particular leader's idea of how Imperial German had 
run its WWI-era war economy. Thirda€”and not nearly as deadly as the first twoa€”was the idea that 
the most we could ask for was the market's "stark utopia", in Karl
Polanyi's words, and that societies needed "Lykourgan moments ".after which all elsea€”even 
(especially?) democracy a€’’would be subordinate to the creed: "the market giveth, the market 
taketh away; blessed be the name of the market".

And, yet, the engine of technological advance has given humanity at least 21 times the 
technological power we had in 1870, and 300 times the prowess of the age of Gilgamesh, King of 
Uruk, two-thirds god and one-third man, who sought deathlessness and learned wisdom. For those of 
us lucky enough to take substantial advantage of that technological pro wessa€’’which is by now 
more than half of usa€”there are vines and fig trees galor! Taco trucks on every
corner!

But also surveillance systems, and thermobaric and nuclear weapons.

James Schneider: The Man Who Understood Democracy: The Life of Alexis de Tocqueville (5/3/22) is a 
new biography of French political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville (1805- 1859)a€!. Leading 
Tocqueville expert Olivier Zunz tells the story of a radical thinker who, uniquely charged by the 
events of his time, both in America and France, used the world as a laboratory for his political 
ideas. Placing Tocquevillea€™ s dedication to
achieving a new kind of democracy at the center of his life and work, Zunz traces Tocquevillea€™ s 
evolution into a passionate student and practitioner of liberal politics across a trove of 
correspondence with intellectuals, politicians, constituents, family members, and friendsa€!. In 
his final years, with France gripped by an authoritarian regime and America divided by slavery, 
Tocqueville feared that the democratic experiment might be
failing. Yet his passion for democracy never weakened. Giving equal attention to the French and 
American sources of Tocquevillea€™ s unique blend of political philosophy and political action, The 
Man Who Understood Democracy offers the richest, most nuanced portrait yet of a man who, born 
between the worlds of aristocracy and democracy, fought tirelessly for the only system that he 
believed could provide both liberty

and equalitya€!

Again, we do not have a trusted model based on economic theory. We have 1920,1942,1948,1951,1974, 
and 1980. We throw out 1942 as irrelevanta€’’inflation brought under control by total-war price 
controls. Which of the other examples of abovea€“5% inflation is most relevant to us today, or are 
we facing something completely new?:

Karen Dynan: What Is Needed to Tame US Inflation?'. a€~Even with little change in slack and only 
gradual fading of supply shocks, the anchoring of expectations and the low weight on past inflation 
[may] lead to a sharp reduction in inflationa€!. Buta€! [that] seems more like a best-case than the 
most likely scenario. To keep inflation expectations anchored (or reanchor them) and restore slack, 
the Fed will need to tighten policy
considerably, movinga€! to a neutral stance and perhaps beyonda€!. The funds rate would need to 
reach [more than] 2.5 percent to achieve a neutral stancea€!. Not tightening policy significantly 
now would increase the chance that inflation stays high, which would require even tighter policy 
later. The experience of the 1970s and early 1980s underscored the critical importance of using 
monetary policy to keep inflation lowa€!. Whether
a    sharp reduction in inflation can be achieved with monetary policy that would remain at least 
slightly accommodative is unclear. Economists do not have a very good understanding of how 
inflation will be propagateda€!. Because the dynamics observed in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
emerged after a lengthy buildup of inflation that begin in the mida€‘T960s, it seems unlikely that 
they would return fully after only a year of high
inflationa€l

This is a very undervalued but very true point:

Paul Krugman: a€™ The Fed might be behind the curve, but people who think ita€™ s obvious are 
making what I consider careless parallels with the 70s. The big difference between now and the big 
disinflation of the 1980s is that back then everyone expected high inflation to be more or less 
permanent. Now you get ridiculed if you say a€oetransitorya€D, but every measure we have says 
people expect inflation to bea€! transitory.
Compare Michigan Survey results for short- and longer-term inflation from 1980 and todaya€!. 
Current breakevens (using 4/15/2023 bond for 1-year) tell basically the same storya€!. Expected 
inflation is somewhat elevated over the medium to long term, but mostly that appears to reflect 
higher inflation over the next year or twoa€!. On the supply side, inflation probably isna€™t baked 
into wage- and price-setting yeta€!. [On] the
demand sidea€! the real interest rate that matters isna€™t the rate over the 10 years starting 
today; ita€™ s the real rate over the 10 years that start one year from now. Ordinarily thata€™ s 
not an important distinction. But times are unusuala€!. If you say something like a€oelnterest 
rates are only 0.25% but inflation is 6, so we have minus 6.25% real interest ratesa€D youa€™re not 
talking about the real rate that mattersa€!

That Lenin did not get the balance between cosmopolitanism, rootless or otherwise, nationalism, and 
hegemonism right is not greatly to his discredit. (But many, many other things are.) My view, 
however, is that Ukrainian nationalism was not the creation of Lennon, and the die was cast well 
before 1917 when the Rada meeting in Kyiv calls for autonomy within the new Russian Democratic 
Republic. They were not Muscovy. They were not the west-leaning
urbanites of Petrograd. They were Ukraine. And that was only strengthened greatly when lands where 
people identified themselves as Polish citizens or Habsburg subjects were added to the mix:

John Ganz: Goodbye Lenin: Putina€™ s Attempt to Undo Two Revolutions'. a€™ For Russians like Putin, 
Lenina€™ s legacy is fraughta€l sometimes portrayed as a more destructive figure than Stalina€L The 
origins of this resentment of Vladimir Ilych are in large part due toa€! Soviet nationalities 
policya€! the convoluted and even sometimes contradictory logic the Bolsheviks applied to the 
problem of rising nationalism in the old
Russian Empirea€!. On the one hand, as good Marxists, they believed in socialist internationalism: 
the workers had no country and the future course of human development would be in greater unity and 
combination rather than division into parochial groupsa€!. But Lenin and Bolsheviks also sincerely 
recognized the real political work performed by national sentiments in the liberation from the 
forces of reaction in general and the
destruction of the Tsarist empirea€’’often called a€oethe prison-house of nationsa€Da€”in

Subject: Draft Project Syndicate Column: What Is the U.S. Macroeconomic Outlook Right Now?

What is the current macro economic outlook here in the United States?

First of all, the Federal Reserve ought to be taking a good many victory laps. The coming of the 
plague bounced employment down by 14%, as pieces of the economy shut down to try to slow the spread 
and as only partially counterbalance the loss of income from those shut downs caused slack demand 
elsewhere in the economy. Then, with reopening, employment bounced up by 7%, leaving it about 7% 
below its pre-plague level.

Getting that 7% of employment back was going to be more difficult because the societal division of 
labor needed to be re-knitted in a new pattern. During the disappointing, anemic, unsatisfactory 
recovery from the great recession a decade ago, that re-knitting took place at a pace of only about 
1.3 percentage points per year. With slack, inadequate, and only slowly growing demand, it was very 
difficult to figure out what business models would be profitable and
where labor was really needed. But this time the economy has re-knit the division of labor to the 
amount of 5% of employment in a year because the Federal Reserve and the Biden administration did 
not, as their counterparts did in the early 2010s, take their feet off the gas pedal much too 
early.

This is a huge economic victory, perhaps the greatest in the United States I have seen. Jay Powell 
and Company should be rightly very proud.

But, as a side effect and a consequence, we have inflation. Our current inflation was inevitable, 
and is not regrettable: when you rapidly re-join the traffic at speed, you leave some of the rubber 
from your tires on the road. But what happens next?
The bond market thinks that this wave of inflation will pass and things will return to normal not 
in the short but in the medium term. The bond market right now judges that between five and 10 
years from now inflation will average 2.2% per year.
Is it right? Probably, but there is a chance that it is not.

I believe that the bond marketa€™ s judgments are relatively trustworthy here. They are, however, 
to be trusted not because the bond market is a good forecaster. The bond market is not. But if our 
current inflation does not die away quickly, it will be because people do not expect it to die away 
quickly. And, as Joe Gagnon of the PIIE points out, the people whose expectations matter for this 
substantially overlap with the people placing bets on the bond market.
In addition, Goldman Sachs reports that its US Financial Conditions index is softening rapidly, and 
the FCI has been a good guide in the past to the strength of the business cycle. Thus there seems 
to be less worry about "overheating" of the economy in the next year and a half than one might have 
feared.

Stepping back, there were six episodes of US inflation above 5% in the 1900s. One, the World War II 
inflation, was cut off by price controls. One, the World War I inflation, was cut off and turned 
into substantial deflation and a deep but short recession by what Milton Friedman judged had been 
an excessive increase by the Federal Reserve and interest rates from 3.75 to 7%. Two, the post 
World War II and the Korean War inflations, were transitory and passed
quickly without substantial monetary tightening. And two made up the 1970s inflation, ultimately 
scotched only by the deep recession of the Volcker disinflation.

Everybody making arguments about the likely course of inflation right now is, whether they 
recognize it or not, basing their arguments not on theoretical principles but on a judgment of 
which historical episode is the best analogy. Those who, like my extremely sharp teacher Olivier 
Blanchard, see the 1970s as the best analogy may be correct, but they have a very weak case: the 
1974 outbreak of inflation came after a previous inflation wave that had shifted
expectations. By 1973 people expected that inflation would, in the absence of ongoing recession, be 
about what inflation had been last yeara€”and, if anything, a little more. I see exactly zero 
evidence for this loss of the anchoring of inflation expectations.

Employment is still some 7.3 million below its pre-plague trend. My extremely sharp teacher Larry 
Summers and Alex Domash see 2.7 million of those as due to structural factorsa€’’population aging 
and immigration restrictionsa€”that cannot be reversed. But that still leaves 4.6 million that are 
now out of the labor force but could be possibly tempted back in by a sufficiently strong economy 
of high opportunity. That potential pool makes me fear an
inflationary wage spiral less.

An inflationary spiral as employers try to hire more workers than can ever be available, 
supply-chain bottlenecks, and self-fulfilling expectationsa€”of the three possible sources of a 
non-transitory inflation, only an inability to resolve supply-chain bottlenecks seems to me at 
least to be a potentially serious risk. And here comes the bad news: Russian dictator Vladimir 
Putina€™ s attack on Ukraine has, as happened in the early 1970s, sent prices of oil and grain
spiraling upward. There is some chance the 1970s will turn out to be the right analogy after all.
