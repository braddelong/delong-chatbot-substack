Dear Mr President,

You have made yourself the Trustee for those in every country who seek to mend the evils of our 
condition by reasoned experiment within the framework of the existing social system. If you fail, 
rational change will be gravely prejudiced throughout the world, leaving orthodoxy and revolution 
to fight it out. But if you succeed, new and bolder methods will be tried everywhere, and we may 
date the first chapter of a new economic era from your accession to
office. This is a sufficient reason why I should venture to lay my reflections before you, though 
under the disadvantages of distance and partial knowledge.

At the moment your sympathisers in England are nervous and sometimes despondent. We wonder whether 
the order of different urgencies is rightly understood, whether there is a confusion of aim, and 
whether some of the advice you get is not crack-brained and queer. If we are disconcerted when we 
defend you, this may be partly due to the influence of our environment in London. For almost 
everyone here has a wildly distorted view of what is happening in the
United States. The average City man believes that you are engaged on a hare-brained expedition in 
face of competent advice, that the best hope lies in your ridding yourself of your present advisers 
to return to the old ways, and that otherwise the United States is heading for some ghastly 
breakdown. That is what they say they smell. There is a recrudescence of wise head-waging by those 
who believe that the nose is a nobler organ than the brain. London is
convinced that we only have to sit back and wait, in order to see what we shall see. May I crave 
your attention, whilst I put my own view?

You are engaged on a double task, Recovery and Reform; a€’’recovery from the slump and the passage 
of those business and social reforms which are long overdue. For the first, speed and quick results 
are essential. The second may be urgent too; but haste will be injurious, and wisdom of long-range 
purpose is more necessary than immediate achievement. It will be through raising high the prestige 
of your administration by success in short-range Recovery, that
you will have the driving force to accomplish long-range Reform. On the other hand, even wise and 
necessary Reform may, in some respects, impede and complicate Recovery. For it will upset the 
confidence of the business world and weaken their existing motives to action, before you have had 
time to put other motives in their place. It may over-task your bureaucratic machine, which the 
traditional individualism of the United States and the old a€oespoils
systema€D have left none too strong. And it will confuse the thought and aim of yourself and your 
administration by giving you too much to think about all at once.

Now I am not clear, looking back over the last nine months, that the order of urgency between 
measures of Recovery and measures of Reform has been duly observed, or that the latter has not 
sometimes been mistaken for the former. In particular, I cannot detect any material aid to recovery 
in N.I.R.A., though its social gains have been large. The driving force which has been put behind 
the vast administrative task set by this Act has seemed to represent a wrong

administration by giving you too much to think about all at once.

Now I am not clear, looking back over the last nine months, that the order of urgency between 
measures of Recovery and measures of Reform has been duly observed, or that the latter has not 
sometimes been mistaken for the former. In particular, I cannot detect any material aid to recovery 
in N.I.R.A., though its social gains have been large. The driving force which has been put behind 
the vast administrative task set by this Act has seemed to represent a wrong
choice in the order of urgencies. The Act is on the Statute Book; a considerable amount has been 
done towards implementing it; but it might be better for the present to allow experience to 
accumulate before trying to force through all its details. That is my first reflectiona€”that 
N.I.R.A., which is essentially Reform and probably impedes Recovery, has been put across too 
hastily, in the false guise of being part of the technique of Recovery.

My second reflection relates to the technique of Recovery itself. The object of recovery is to 
increase the national output and put more men to work. In the economic system of the modern world, 
output is primarily produced for sale; and the volume of output depends on the amount of purchasing 
power, compared with the prime cost of production, which is expected to come n the market. Broadly 
speaking, therefore, and increase of output depends on the amount
of purchasing power, compared with the prime cost of production, which is expected to come on the 
market. Broadly speaking, therefore, an increase of output cannot occur unless by the operation of 
one or other of three factors. Individuals must be induced to spend more out of their existing 
incomes; or the business world must be induced, either by increased confidence in the prospects or 
by a lower rate of interest, to create additional current incomes in the
hands of their employees, which is what happens when either the working or the fixed capital of the 
country is being increased; or public authority must be called in aid to create additional current 
incomes through the expenditure of borrowed or printed money. In bad times the first factor cannot 
be expected to work on a sufficient scale. The second factor will come in as the second wave of 
attack on the slump after the tide has been turned by the expenditures of
public authority. It is, therefore, only from the third factor that we can expect the initial major 
impulse.

Now there are indications that two technical fallacies may have affected the policy of your 
administration. The first relates to the part played in recovery by rising prices. Rising prices 
are to be welcomed because they are usually a symptom of rising output and employment. When more 
purchasing power is spent, one expects rising output at rising prices. Since there cannot be rising 
output without rising prices, it is essential to ensure that the recovery shall not be
held back by the insufficiency of the supply of money to support the increased monetary turn-over. 
But there is much less to be said in favour of rising prices, if they are brought about at the 
expense of rising output. Some debtors may be helped, but the national recovery as a whole will be 
retarded. Thus rising prices caused by deliberately increasing prime costs or by restricting output 
have a vastly inferior value to rising prices which are the natural result of an
increase in the nationa€™ s purchasing power.

I do not mean to impugn the social justice and social expediency of the redistribution of incomes 
aimed at by N.I.R.A. and by the various schemes for agricultural restriction. The latter, in 
particular, I should strongly support in principle. But too much emphasis on the remedial value of 
a higher price-level as an object in itself may lead to serious misapprehension as to the part 
which prices can play in the technique of recovery. The stimulation of output by
increasing aggregate purchasing power is the right way to get prices up; and not the other way 
round.

Thus as the prime mover in the first stage of the technique of recovery I lay overwhelming emphasis 
on the increase of national purchasing power resulting from governmental expenditure which is 
financed by Loans and not by taxing present incomes. Nothing else counts in comparison with this. 
In a boom inflation can be caused by allowing unlimited credit to support the excited enthusiasm of 
business speculators. But in a slump governmental Loan
expenditure is the only sure means of securing quickly a rising output at rising prices. That is 
why a war has always caused intense industrial activity. In the past orthodox finance has regarded 
a war as the only legitimate excuse for creating employment by governmental expenditure. You, Mr 
President, having cast off such fetters, are free to engage in the interests of peace and 
prosperity the technique which hitherto has only been allowed to serve the purposes of
war   and destruction.

The set-back which American recovery experienced this autumn was the predictable consequence of the 
failure of your administration to organise any material increase in new Loan expenditure during 
your first six months of office. The position six months hence will entirely depend on whether you 
have been laying the foundations for larger expenditures in the near future.

I am not surprised that so little has been spent up-to-date. Our own experience has shown how 
difficult it is to improvise useful Loan-expenditures at short notice. There are many obstacle to 
be patiently overcome, if waste, inefficiency and corruption are to be avoided. There are many 
factors, which I need not stop to enumerate, which render especially difficult in the United States 
the rapid improvisation of a vast programme of public works. I do not blame Mr
Ickes for being cautious and careful. But the risks of less speed must be weighed against those of 
more haste. He must get across the crevasses before it is dark.

The other set of fallacies, of which I fear the influence, arises out of a crude economic doctrine 
commonly known as the Quantity Theory of Money. Rising output and rising incomes will suffer a 
set-back sooner or later if the quantity of money is rigidly fixed. Some people seem to infer from 
this that output and income can be raised by increasing the quantity of money. But this is like 
trying to get fat by buying a larger belt. In the United States to-day your belt is
plenty big enough for your belly. It is a most misleading thing to stress the quantity of money, 
which is only a limiting factor, rather than the volume of expenditure, which is the operative 
factor.

It is an even more foolish application of the same ideas to believe that there is a mathematical 
relation between the price of gold and the prices of other things. It is true that the value of the 
dollar in terms of foreign currencies will affect the prices of those goods which enter into 
international trade. In so far as an over-valuation of the dollar was impeding the freedom of 
domestic price-raising policies or disturbing the balance of payments with foreign countries, it
was advisable to depreciate it. But exchange depreciation should follow the success of your 
domestic price-raising policy as its natural consequence, and should not be allowed to disturb the 
whole world by preceding its justification at an entirely arbitrary pace. This is another example 
of trying to put on flesh by letting out the belt.

These criticisms do not mean that I have weakened in my advocacy of a managed currency or in 
preferring stable prices to stable exchanges. The currency and exchange policy of a country should 
be entirely subservient to the aim of raising output and employment to the right level. But the 
recent gyrations of the dollar have looked to me more like a gold standard on the booze than the 
ideal managed currency of my dreams.

You may be feeling by now, Mr President, that my criticism is more obvious than my sympathy. Yet 
truly that is not so. You remain for me the ruler whose general outlook and attitude to the tasks 
of government are the most sympathetic in the world. You are the only one who sees the necessity of 
a profound change of methods and is attempting it without intolerance, tyranny or destruction. You 
are feeling your way by trial and error, and are felt to be, as you
should be, entirely uncommitted in your own person to the details of a particular technique. In my 
country, as in your own, your position remains singularly untouched by criticism of this or the 
other detail. Our hope and our faith are based on broader considerations.

If you were to ask me what I would suggest in concrete terms for the immediate future, I would 
reply thus.

In the field of gold-devaluation and exchange policy the time has come when uncertainty should be 
ended. This game of blind mana€™ s buff with exchange speculators serves no useful purpose and is 
extremely undignified. It upsets confidence, hinders business decisions, occupies the public 
attention in a measure far exceeding its real importance, and is responsible both for the 
irritation and for a certain lack of respect which exists abroad. You have three
alternatives. You can devalue the dollar in terms of gold, returning to the gold standard at a new 
fixed ratio. This would be inconsistent with your declarations in favour of a long-range policy of 
stable prices, and I hope you will reject it. You can seek some common policy of exchange 
stabilisation with Great Britain aimed at stable price-levels. This would be the best ultimate 
solution; but it is not practical politics at the moment unless you are prepared to talk in
terms                                                                                               
                                                                                                    
                of an initial value of sterling well below $5 pending the realisation of a marked 
rise in your domestic price-level. Lastly you can announce that you will definitely control the 
dollar exchange by buying and selling gold and foreign currencies so as to avoid wide or 
meaningless fluctuations, with a right to shift the parities at any time but with a declared 
intention only so to do either to correct a serious want of balance in Americaa€™ s international 
receipts
and payments or to meet a shift in your domestic price level relatively to price- levels abroad. 
This appears to me to be your best policy during the transitional period. In other respects you 
would regain your liberty to make your exchange policy subservient to the needs of your domestic 
policy—free to let out your belt in proportion as you put on flesh.

In the field of domestic policy, I put in the forefront, for the reasons given above, a large 
volume of Loan-expenditures under Government auspices. It is beyond my province to choose 
particular objects of expenditure. But preference should be given to those which can be made to 
mature quickly on a large scale, as for example the rehabilitation of the physical condition of the 
railroads. The object is to start the ball rolling. The United States is ready to roll
towards prosperity, if a good hard shove can be given in the next six months. Could not the energy 
and enthusiasm, which launched the N.I.R.A. in its early days, be put behind a campaign for 
accelerating capital expenditures, as wisely chosen as the pressure of circumstances permits? You 
can at least feel sure that the country will be better enriched by such projects than by the 
involuntary idleness of millions.

I put in the second place the maintenance of cheap and abundant credit and in particular the 
reduction of the long-term rates of interest. The turn of the tide in great Britain is largely 
attributable to the reduction in the long-term rate of interest which ensued on the success of the 
conversion of the War Loan. This was deliberately engineered by means of the open-market policy of 
the Bank of England. I see no reason why you should not reduce the rate of interest
on                                                                                                  
                                                                                                    
          your long-term Government Bonds to 21aD„2 per cent or less with favourable repercussions 
on the whole bond market, if only the Federal Reserve System would replace its present holdings of 
short-dated Treasury issues by purchasing long-dated issues in exchange. Such a policy might become 
effective in the course of a few months, and I attach great importance to it.

With these adaptations or enlargements of your existing policies, I should expect a successful 
outcome with great confidence. How much that would mean, not only to the material prosperity of the 
United States and the whole World, but in comfort to mena€™ s minds through a restoration of their 
faith in the wisdom and the power of Government!
