1) Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago, New York: Harper and Row, 1976, Pt. I ch. 4 p. 79 
<https://books.google.com/books?id=rffwDwAAQBAJ>. He was thinking
of the Bosheviki and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. But the truth, I think, apply equally 
well to really-existing socialism and its fraternal-twin sibling of fascism.

2) Carnegie, Wealth, n.p.

3) Benito Mussolini, The Doctrine of Fascism, 1932, n.p. <https://sjsu.edu/faculty/wooda/2B-HUM/

Century, New York: HarperCollins, 2021 <https://books .google.com/books ?id=JSOAEAAAQB A J>; R. J.

8) The best thing I have read about peoplea€™ s reactions to the figure of Hitlera€”then and 
sincea€”is Ron Rosenbaum, Explaining Hitler; The Search for the Origins of His Evil,

New York: Random House, 1998 <https://books.google.com/books?id=xLoOUyOiNOUC&printsec=frontcovere>.

9) I still like, as a general history of Naziism more than any other, William L. Shirer, The Rise 
and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany, New York: Simon and
Schuster, 1960 <https://books.google.com/books?id=I4CGtwEACAAJ>, for reasons that are 
well-expressed by Ron Rosenbaum, a€oeRevisiting The Rise and Fall of the Third
Reicha€D, Smithsonian (February 2012) 
<https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/revisiting-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-thirdreich-20231221/>. 
You can read the raw material of
what makes Shirer so special in William L. Shirer, Berlin Diary, New York: Knopf, 1941 
<https://books.google.com/books?id=ExOVUEzmCo8C>. But it is not as good.

Browning, Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland, New York: 
Harper Perennial, 1993 <https://books.google.com/books?
