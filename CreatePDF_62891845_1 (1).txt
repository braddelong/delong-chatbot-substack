FIRST: In What Sense Was the Pre-Industrial Economy a€oeMalthusiana€d?

Consider smart young thirty-something whippersnapper Rafael Guthman:

Rafaela€™s Commentary

Thoughts in economics, society, politics, and history
By Rafael R. Guthmann

He has been taking aimed sniper shots at the idea that the pre-industrial economy was in any sense 
a€oeMalthusiana€D. He makes lots of good points:

Rafael R. Guthmann: Beware the GDP\ a€~The 1937 German worker could rent 181% as many rooms as an 
American worker today, buy 99% as many potatoes, 42% as much bread, 47% as much a€cenaturala€D 
cheese, and 26% as much beef. Compare these figures to the 13.5% per capita GDP a€oemeasureda€D in 
the Maddison dataset. Note also that the relative prices between rent and beef are different by a 
factor of eight. This
is so thanks to technological change: US real estate became expensive over time as other goods 
became relatively cheaper, which means that estimated variation in GDP changes a lot depending on 
the method used to estimate it.

We measure nutritional standards using height data. In the US today, the average adult male height 
is 175.3 cm, in India average adult male heights are 10 cm shorter, at 165 cm. However, Indian men 
from the upper classes are 174.4 cm tall, and less than 1 cm shorter than Americans, which suggests 
the difference is not genetic but nutritional. For comparison, German 17a€“18 year old schoolkids 
were reaching 175 cm just before
WW2a€!. The Maddison dataset claims the GDP per capita of Greece two thousand years ago was about 
1,300 dollars, which is about 1/5 of the level of GDP per capita of India and about 1/4 of Pakistan 
or Nigeria today. However, skeletons from Hellenistic Greece suggest an average height of 172 cm, 
which is much closer to current American heights than to heights in India (165 cm) or Pakistan 
(165.8 cm) today.

Also, the Maddison dataset claims incomes in Ancient Greece two thousand years ago were only 30% 
higher than in Iron Age Belgium (around the same time). Houses in Iron Age Belgiuma€! houses in 
Greecea€! these houses do not appear very consistent with a [mere] 30% difference in per capita 
GDPa€!. The people living in Greco-Roman city-states had the perception that they were 
sophisticated civilized folk and their neighboring
tribal populations were uneducated and ferocious barbarians. Perhaps, this perception was not only 
due to delusional ethnocentric beliefs but instead a consequence of the very concrete difference in 
the material sophistication of their societies?

a€oeEconomic growth began recently and everybody in the pasta€”even Europeans less than a century 
agoa€’’consisted of peasants living under minimum subsistencea€Da€”or is it just that the lack of 
evidence combined with the spurious application of platonic theoretical constructs such as GDP that 
make us think that way?a€!

Rafaela€™ s Commentary
Beware the GDP

If you log on to the a€oeEconomic Growtha€D page of a€oeOur World in Dataa€D it is easy to access 
estimates of GDP for over a hundred countries for the last two thousand years. These estimates are 
presented as fact. For example, right at the beginning of the first section titled a€oeThe history 
of economic growtha€D it says in the third paragrapha€!

But I cannot buy the full package.

So let me try to explain in what sense I think that pre-1500 Agrarian-Age (and 1500-1770 
Imperial-Commercial Age, and 1770-1970 Industrial-Revolution Age, in fact all pre-demographic 
transition economies) were Malthusian.
The problem is that I want to start from a basecamp: the Solow-Malthus economic-growth model. So I 
send you off to read my background theory lecture notes on the Solow-Malthus economic-growth model:

Back? Angry that I made you march through 14 pages of algebra? Contemptuous and we economistsa€™ 
inclination to use math serves as an entry barrier meaning that we only have to talk to ourselves, 
and not to people trained in other disciplines who are unable or unwilling to follow what happens 
when you start taking the derivative of a logarithm?
Sorry: then I really cannot help you.

But if you are merely annoyed because you refused to be marched through 14 pages of algebra? If you 
are willing to take what I have to say about Solow-Malthus economic-growth theory provisionally on 
faith if only I give you a quick precis to get you to the bottom line?
Then I can help you. Here we go:

Malthusian Models


The ratio of

The salience of
capital in determining
productivity

The extent to
which population
depresses

productivity                               Sensitivity of

income      level

True zpg
subsistence

productivity to
populatio

Rate of
useful ideas


Taste for

Responsiveness of


equilibrium
population

savings to        the taste for
depreciation luxury

luxuries population growth

to prosperity

If we are willing to assume that:

1. A societya€™ s productivity depends primarily on (a) its willingness to save and invest, and (b) 
the efficiency of its workers, which is in turn a function of (c) its level of technology a€’’its 
useful ideas about manipulating nature and organizing humansa€”and (d) its natural resources per 
worker.

2. A societya€™ s population growth rate depends on (a) its level of consumption of necessities 
that make you biologically fit to reproduce relative to (b) its sociologically-determined familial 
and other institutions that potentially curb the rate of reproduction.

3. Societies differ in the proportion of their productive resources they allocate to necessities 
vis-A -vis luxuries.

4. Technological progress before the Industrial-Revolution Age proceeded at a slow average 
proportional growth rate h measured in hundredths of a percent per year.
Then we get:

• The right-hand side of the slide above: the societya€™ s level of productivity per worker will 
head for and then tend to oscillate around a Malthusian level equal to (a) the societya€™ s taste 
for non-necessities (which include such things as having a rapacious and greedy upper class, and 
liking to live in cities), times (b) its sociologically-determined subsistence level of necessities 
consumption (which can be raised by things like a late age of first
female marriage, large-scale female infanticide, or frequent chevauchA©es), times quantitatively 
unimportant nuisance terms.

•  The left-hand side of the slide above: the societya€™ s population density will head for and 
then tend to oscillate around a Malthusian level equal to (a) the quality and abundance of natural 
resources per acre, times (b) the ratio of the technology level to the a€cesubsistencea€D level of 
necessities consumption at which the population barely replaces itself, times (c) the propensity to 
save and invest in everything that makes humanity more
productive (from tools to liming the soil to building commercial networks), (d) a chief boost to 
which its the provision of a pax imperia, times (e) the inverse of the taste for non-necessities, 
all (e) raised to the power that is the extent that higher population induces resource scarcity and 
thus lower productivity, times quantitatively unimportant nuisance terms.

As the centuries and millennia pass, the Malthusian equilibrium level of population density will 
slowly rise as technology improves.

And as the centuries and millennia pass, the Malthusian level of typical human living standards 
will slowly rise even as necessities-valued production per worker does not to the extent that there 
is faster technological progress in making middle-class conveniences than in making true 
bioreproductive necessities.
But even though a society tends to go back to its Malthusian equilibrium, it does not have to be 
there: all kinds of shocks can knock it away.

Moreover, and more important, the Malthusian equilibrium can and does shift. There are BigTime 
changes across societies and over time as polity and sociology shift in:

• the subsistence level of necessities consumption

• the taste for luxuries

• the incentives to save and invest

These drive big differences in how societies look and are, and big differences in how societiesa€™ 
economies grow and shrink: truly dire Dark Ages like post-Roman Britain or the early-Iron Age 
Afgean; truly magnificent (if often cruel and astonishingly unequal) civilizational 
a€ceefflorescencesa€D as Jack Goldstone has taught us to call them. Establish a pax imperia, with 
associated protection of commerce and industry from freelance expropriation by
thugs with spears through a government that controls its own functionaries and so generate lots of 
savings, investment, and an increased division of labor; acquire a taste for luxuries, especially 
living in cities and upper-class and even middle-class display of comfort; and generate 
sociological institutions that curb and control female fertility and female-child survival, and 
watch what happens. On the other side, have barbarians within the gate so that as much
wealth as possible is immediately turned into silver and buried, establish a sociology of very 
early female first marriage, and have little taste for or indeed specialization in producing 
non-necessitiesa€”and your Malthusian equilibrium can shift to something of interest to 
archAiologists, but not of interest to artists or indeed to connoisseurs of material culture.

Moreover, remember this alwavs: the gulf between the standard of living of the upper and even the 
middle class (who leave the major archAiological footprint) on the one hand and the 
peasant-craftsman-servant working class on the other, whose reproduction generates the resource 
scarcitv that anchors the Malthusian equilibrium^’’that can and does varv widelv and wildlv as 
well.

David Autor, Anna Salomons, & Bryan Seegmiller: New Frontiers: The Origins & Content of New Work, 
1940a€“2018: a€~We estimate that the majority of contemporary employment is found in new job tasks

and clerical occupations in the first four post-WWII decades, to high-paid professional and, 
secondarily, low-paid services
since 1980a€!.. Leveraging proxies for output-augmenting and task-automating innovations built from 
a century of patent data and harnessing occupational demand shifts stemming from trade and 
demographic shocks, we show that new occupational tasks emerge in response to both positive demand 
shifts and augmenting innovations, but not in response to negative demand shifts or automation

I do not think we have powerful resilience in the system. In the 1990s I used to hear from 
Republicans that Clinton was not a legitimate president first because he had only won 43% of the 
vote (as Ross Perot split the real and rightful Republican majority), and second that the 
democratic party had forfeited its right to have a place at the table when they decided to back him 
during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Then in the early 2010s I heard not from
Republicans I talked to, but in whispers, that a Black man could not legitimately govern a white 
nation. Now again I hear the whispers that Biden is too old to be a legitimate president. Democracy 
requires a loyal opposition, or it breaks down. And there is no loyal opposition on the Republican 
side anymorea€’’there is only the Trumpist Party, and the whimpering Never Trump remnant:

I do not think we have powerful resilience in the system. In the 1990s I used to hear from 
Republicans that Clinton was not a legitimate president first because he had only won 43% of the 
vote (as Ross Perot split the real and rightful Republican majority), and second that the 
democratic party had forfeited its right to have a place at the table when they decided to back him 
during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Then in the early 2010s I heard not from
Republicans I talked to, but in whispers, that a Black man could not legitimately govern a white 
nation. Now again I hear the whispers that Biden is too old to be a legitimate president. Democracy 
requires a loyal opposition, or it breaks down. And there is no loyal opposition on the Republican 
side anymorea€’’there is only the Trumpist Party, and the whimpering Never Trump remnant:

Lucan Way: Volatile Compounds'. a€~A developing fear among Republicans that they wona€™ t be able 
to win a presidential election democratically^!. Theya€! nowa€! feel this growing threat to their 
survival as a partya€! [unless they] move into authoritarian territorya€!. Trumpa€! pushed them 
over the linea€!. Theya€™ ve made a commitment to thisa€! electorate that feels a demographic 
threat from immigration. This
commitment turns everything in politics into an existential threata€!. U.S. democracy is declining, 
yes, buta€! the resilience in the system is ultimately very powerfula€!
