SLOUCHING TOWARDS UTOPIA

J. BRADFORD DELONG

PREORDER NOW • ON SALE 6 SEPTEMBER

AJ3: My strong belief that history should focus on the long twentieth century stands in contrast to 
what othersa€”most notably the Marxist British historian Eric Hobsbawma€”have focused on and called 
the a€oeshort twentieth century ,a€D which lasted from the start of World War I in 1914 to the fall 
of the Soviet Union in 1991 .[3][h] Such others tend to see the nineteenth century as the long rise 
of democracy and capitalism, from 1776 to 1914,[i] and the
short twentieth century as one in which really-existing socialism and fascism shake the world.[j]

Longer Notes:

[h] It was reading Hobsbawm and thinking a€oenoa€”thata€™ s not the right storya€D that put one of 
the many bees in my bonnet that has led, in the fullness of time, to this book.

There is barely a paragraph in the book that has not been the subject of fierce controversy, or 
that takes a point-of-view has not been rejected as wrong by thoughtful and learned historians, or 
that is at the very least massively over- or understated. So I acknowledge that smart people of 
goodwill can deliver trenchant and largely-unanswerable criticisms against nearly every single 
paragraph.
And I very much hope they will do so: it is one of the few ways that I can learn.

[i] The idea of the Long 19th Century is truly a staple of historical interpretation: you can find 
it at Kahn Academy 
<https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/whp-origins/era-6-the-long-nineteenth-centurv-1750-ce-to-191
4-ce>. Wikipedia claims it was coined by Ilya Ehrenberg and/or Eric Hobsbawm, and in Hobsbawma€™ s 
case it finds expression in his trilogy: The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789a€ “1848, The Age of 
Capital: 1848a€ “1875, and The Age
of Empire: 1875a€“1914. It is certainly a textbook staple; see, for example: Trevor Getz: The Long 
Nineteenth Century, 1750-1914: Crucible of Modernity 
<https://www.amazon.com/Long-Nineteenth-Centurv-1750-1914-Modernity/dp/1474270522>.

The underlying animating principle is that of dual revolutions'. economica€”the Industrial 
Revolutiona€”and politicala€”the Democratic Re volutiona€’’proceeding in parallel, mutually 
reinforcing and shaping each other, launched sometime in the 1700s and reaching a culmination of 
sorts with the start of World War 1.1 have been able to trace the idea that this is the right way 
to understand the history only back to Friedrich Engelsa€™ s footnote (d) to Part I of
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (1848): The Communist Manifesto <http://www.slp.org/pdf/marx/comm 
man,pdf>: a€oeGenerally speaking, for the economical development of the bourgeoisie, England is 
here taken as the typical country, for its political development, Francea€!a€D needless to say, 
there is a little warrant for a belief that the general tide of political development followsa€”as 
some kind of imperfect copya€”the development of France, and
there is only little warrant for a belief that the general tide of economic development 
followsa€”as some kind of imperfect copya€”the development of England.

[j] It is not just on the left that there is a vogue for seeing a short 20th century bracketed by 
the rise and fall of really-existing socialism. See the excellent John Lukacs: A Short History of 
the Twentieth Century <https ://archive .org/details/shorthistoryoftw00001uka>. And, of course, 
Francis Fukuyama (1989): a€oeThe End of History?a€D, National Interest 16 (Summer), pp. 3-18
