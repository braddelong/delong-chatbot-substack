The Read: Daniel Laurison, Producing Politics

Why did I get this book? Laurison is my colleague, but I also think hea€™ s one of the more 
sophisticated intellectuals I know when it comes to thinking about the specific, measurable 
consequences of social capital and educational attainment and one of the few observers of politics 
(both formal party politics and the wider social field of a€~being politicala€!
