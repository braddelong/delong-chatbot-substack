Own your own site. Visit all your friends' sites. Bring back the artisan, hand-crafted Web. Sure, it's a little more work, but it's worth it. You don't even need to stop using social media! It's a "yes, and" situation, not a "no, but" one…. 1. Create/reactivate your own site, owned by you, to hold your own work. 2. When you create that site, write or otherwise present work on your site at least once a week, every week. 3. Regularly visit the sites of other creators…. 4. Promote/link the work of others…. </p><p>Now, <em>why </em>should we bring back that artisan, hand-crafted Web? Oh, I don’t know. Wouldn’t it be <em>nice </em>to have a site that’s not run by an amoral billionaire chaos engine, or algorithmically designed to keep you doomscrolling in a state of fear and anger, or is essentially spyware for governments and/or corporations?…. Yes, it <em>will </em>take some work…. It’s an actual project. But look at this way: You have just spent years building an audience on a platform someone <em>else </em>owns. Why not take a little time to do it for yourself?… </p><p>For my own site, I use <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>…. Not every one needs or wants their own site, and that’s fine. But if you don’t want to bother with creating your own site, you can still decide to visit the sites of people who create them, and not just stay within the bounds of Twitter/Facebook/Instagram/TikTok, etc…</p></blockquote><p>A very, very nice call to action by a very skilled and eloquent writer. He is, of course, at some level, completely correct. But calls to virtuous collective action need to be carefully crafted to not ask more of the audience than it will be willing to deliver. In this case, that means that we need to have an accurate theory of what caused the Fall of the Blogosphere in the first place.  Why did the audience—and, yes, the creators too—succumb to the Siren song, and wind up doomscrolling through clickbait so that their glued-to-the-screen eyeballs could be sold to advertisers convincing them that the worse is actually the better product as they sell their fake diabetes cures and crypto grifts?</p><p>When I talk to people, they shrug and say "attention economy” and “human rapid, response, dopamine loops”. Some of them then go on to say: we hope that Apple's advertising tracking transparency will save us all by putting enough sand into the gears of the advertising-attention machine that we humans can then escape from it. After all, when humans are given a choice, the overwhelmingly do not want advertisers to be able to hack their brains not necessarily for their benefit. The revealed preference is that people do not want this at all.</p><p>But “Help us, Tim Cook! You are our only hope!” is a very weak reed to rely on here.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/old-style-blogging-should-be-new?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/old-style-blogging-should-be-new?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>ONE IMAGE: <strong>Consider What Having This Stuff in Your Twitter Timeline Would Do to Your Brain:</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7642c6b6-a51b-48fc-9172-9c75c3adb4e8_2488x1476.png"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7642c6b6-a51b-48fc-9172-9c75c3adb4e8_2488x1476.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7642c6b6-a51b-48fc-9172-9c75c3adb4e8_2488x1476.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7642c6b6-a51b-48fc-9172-9c75c3adb4e8_2488x1476.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7642c6b6-a51b-48fc-9172-9c75c3adb4e8_2488x1476.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7642c6b6-a51b-48fc-9172-9c75c3adb4e8_2488x1476.png" width="1456" height="864" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7642c6b6-a51b-48fc-9172-9c75c3adb4e8_2488x1476.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:864,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1730537,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7642c6b6-a51b-48fc-9172-9c75c3adb4e8_2488x1476.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7642c6b6-a51b-48fc-9172-9c75c3adb4e8_2488x1476.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7642c6b6-a51b-48fc-9172-9c75c3adb4e8_2488x1476.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7642c6b6-a51b-48fc-9172-9c75c3adb4e8_2488x1476.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>No, Elon Musk is not the richest man in the world—he has very large positions in a few companies (most of) which are traded on the market as meme stocks, and the slope of the demand curve is correspondingly steep; thus any attempt to diversify would see most of the supposed wealth evaporate; and the appropriately discounted present value of expected cash  flows is far below the claimed headline wealth number.</p><p>But he is a very rich man.
