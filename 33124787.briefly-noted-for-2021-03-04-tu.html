<h3>First:</h3><p><strong>Yonatan Zunger</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Tolerance Is Not a Moral Precept. The Title of This Essay Should Disturb You</em>: ‘As with any peace treaty, we must consider toleration in the broader context of the war which is its alternative, and we must recognize that peace is not always a possibility…. Among the worst wars of tolerance were the religious wars which tore through Europe between 1524 and 1648…. Protestants and Catholics each seeing the other as existential threats…. These wars came to an end… each ruler had the right to choose the religion of their state, and that Christians living in principalities where their faith was not the established faith still had the right to practice their religion. A decision was made, in essence, to accept the risk of the monster rather than the reality of the war…. Tolerance, viewed as a moral absolute, amounts to renouncing the right to self-protection; but viewed as a peace treaty, it can be the basis of a stable society. Its protections extend only to those who would uphold it in turn. To withdraw those protections from those who would destroy it does not violate its moral principles; it is fundamental to them, because without this enforcement, the treaty would collapse. It is appropriate, even ethical, to answer force with proportional force, when that force is required to restore a just peace. We seek peace because on the whole it is far better than war; but as history has taught us, not every peace is better than the war it prevents… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://extranewsfeed.com/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376">https://extranewsfeed.com/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><h3>Briefly Noted:</h3><ul><li><p>My Great^12 Grandfather: <strong>Wikipedia</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Thomas Wyatt the Younger</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wyatt_the_Younger">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wyatt_the_Younger</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Wikimedia Commons</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Hawksbees Electrical Machine, by Jean-Antoine Nollet</em>&lt;<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hawksbees_Electrical_Machine_by_Jean-Antoine_Nollet.jpg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hawksbees_Electrical_Machine_by_Jean-Antoine_Nollet.jpg</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><em>Georgette Heyer Un-Conference Thursday 25 Feb</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://tanaudel.wordpress.com/2021/02/23/georgette-heyer-un-conference-thursday-25-feb/">https://tanaudel.wordpress.com/2021/02/23/georgette-heyer-un-conference-thursday-25-feb/</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Martin Wolf</strong>:&nbsp;<em>What Central Banks Ought to Target</em>: ‘today’s broad approach to central banking is clearly the least bad. That does not mean it is easy to operate. It is quite likely that the monetary policy needed to generate maximum employment and stable inflation is consistent with all sorts of crazy activity in the financial system. We are surely seeing plenty of that now. But no sane central bank would deliberately create recessions in order to save finance from itself. Rather, it must save the economy from finance by tough regulation, especially of leverage… LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/160db526-5e8d-4152-b711-21501a7fbd01">https://www.ft.com/content/160db526-5e8d-4152-b711-21501a7fbd01</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>American Purpose</strong>:&nbsp;<em>About</em>: ‘A magazine, media project, and intellectual community….

The largest in value is our property/casualty insurance operation…. [Our] financial strength, coupled with the huge flow of cash Berkshire annually receives from its non-insurance businesses, allows our insurance companies to safely follow an equity-heavy investment strategy not feasible for the overwhelming majority of insurers. Those competitors, for both regulatory and credit-rating reasons, must focus on bonds. And bonds are not the place to be these days…. Risky loans, however, are not the answer to inadequate interest rates…. Berkshire now enjoys $138 billion of insurance “float”—funds that do not belong to us, but are nevertheless ours to deploy….

Baen cannot disavow responsibility for those words, regardless of whether or not they happened because someone was asleep at the wheel. One of the reasons a business cannot ignore the importance of moderating any boards that they run is that they are responsible for the words posted on there. They can’t just turn over the keys to the car and say “drive this where you like.” They’re still enabling that car to bounce along the highway, swerving to hit any pedestrian it suspects of being from a particular group…. When you are a leader, whether you like it or not, you are responsible for what is happening under your leadership, whether you’re aware of it or not, because that’s part of the role….

Virtualize your camera: regardless of the software you use, virtualize your camera. Always. It’s probably what makes the biggest difference. My absolute recommendation is mmhmm…. Good lighting is key…. Don’t share your screen: when making a presentation, screen sharing is almost always the worst option, except in some specific cases (use of spreadsheets, etc.) Instead, share your presentations using the virtual camera, or use the virtual backgrounds to locate your presentation. This will give you more presentation options, you will be seen at all times at a reasonable size, and you will communicate better, more strongly….

That… incommensurable collections of miscellaneous objects cannot in themselves provide the material for a quantitative analysis need not… prevent us from making approximate statistical comparisons, depending on some broad element of judgment… which may possess significance and validity within certain limits. But the proper place for such things as net real output and the general level of prices lies within the field of historical and statistical description, and their purpose should be to satisfy historical or social curiosity…. To say that net output to-day is greater, but the price-level lower, than ten years ago or one year ago, is a proposition of a similar character to the statement that Queen Victoria was a better queen but not a happier woman than Queen Elizabeth—a proposition not without meaning and not without interest, but unsuitable as material for the differential calculus.
