One set of lenses with which to view the technological core of modern economic growth brings into 
focus General Purpose Technologies: those technologies where advances change, if not everything, a 
lot, as they ramify across sector upon sector.

Steampower was the first. Early machine tools which embodied in their design and construction so 
much technological knowledge about how to shape materials was the second. Then came 
telecommunications, materials science, organic chemistry, internal-combustion engines, the assembly 
line, subsequent machine-tool generations, and electricity. We know that these are GPTs because, 
eventually, it made no sense to speak of them as discrete a€oesectorsa€n
apart from the rest of the economy.

After the first two of these, the rest make up Robert Gordona€™ s a€oeone big wavea€D of 
technological advance that he sees transforming the global north over 1870-1980, and then ebbing.

In the 1950s there came another GPT. Electricity was no longer a sector, for it was everywhere. But 
there emerged something called a€cemicroelectronicsa€D: electrons made to dance Not in the service 
of providing power but rather of assisting and amplifying calculation^’’and communication.

Take sand, which is mostly very finely grained particles of the rock quartz. Purify it by removing 
things like pieces of shell. Heat it to more than 1700A°Ca€”that is 3100A°F. Add carbon. The carbon 
will then pull the oxygen atoms out of the quartz to make carbon dioxide, and leave behind pure 
silicon. Cool the silicon to about 1400A°Ca€’’that is, 2550A°F. Then drop a small seed crystal into 
the barely liquid silicon, and pull up the seed crystal as the
surrounding silicon cooling into solidity and attaches itself to it. If you have done this right, 
you will then have a cylinder of pure monocrystalline silicon. Slice it finely. Each slice is a 
a€cewafera€D of pure silicon crystal.

A pure silicon crystal will not conduct electricity. Of the 14 electrons associated with each 
silicon atom, two are tightly bound in the quantum states chemists call the Is orbital, one doing 
something that our feeble East African Plains Ape brains metaphorically try to understand by saying 
that it is a€oespinninga€D with its axis of rotation pointing up, one pointing down. (But that name 
a€ceorbitala€D is wrong: they really do not really a€ceorbita€D, although
Niels Bohr a century and more ago thought they did. But he did not have it right. SchrAJdinger put 
him straight.)

It is a fundamental property of electrons that they cannot crowd each other into the same quantum 
state, and so there is only room for twoa€”one spin-up, one spin-do wna€”in the Is orbital. The 
next eight electrons must find quantum states with higher energy: two electrons in the 2s 
orbitalsa€”one spin-up, one spin-do wna€’’and six in the 2p orbitals. (Why six? Because p electrons 
a€ cere vol vea€D in the same sense that all electrons a€cespina€D; because
space is three-dimensional tending to revolve from front to back, from left to right, and from 
side-to-side are different quantum orbital states; and because a spin-up electron can share the 
rest of its orbital quantum numbers that specify its state with a spin-down one.)

That leaves four electrons remaining. They, in a silicon crystal are in quantum states that 
chemists call 3sp orbitals. They are all tightly shared by their home nucleus and the nuclei of the 
four silicon atoms that are its close neighbors in the crystal. These electrons are locked into 
their quantum orbital states: it requires a lot of energy to knock them out and make them move. 
Thus silicon cannot conduct electricity. Being a conductor requires that it be easy to knock
electrons out of their ground states and into conduction-band orbitals quantum states, in which 
they are only very loosely bound to any one particular atomic nucleus.

However, suppose you replace one of the silicon atoms in the crystal with a phosphorus atom, with 
its not fourteen but fifteen electrons. If there are not too many such phosphorus atomsa€”one in 
every 10,000 atoms is more than enougha€”each phosphorus nucleus will simply slot into and fill the 
place of the silicon nucleus it replaces. Fourteen of the phosphorus atoma€™ s electrons will act 
like the silicon atoma€™ s electrons: locked into place, Tightly
bound in their 3sp orbital to both their home nucleus and to the four neighboring nuclei. But the 
phosphorus atoma€™ s fifteenth electron cannot fit. It finds a higher energy band in which it is 
only loosely bound to any one nucleus: the conduction band. Silicon doped with phosphorus thus 
becomes a conductor. And if you do something to create a current that pulls those 19th electrons 
away, it becomes a non-conductive insulator instead.

Thus by applying or removing small voltages of electrical current and electromagnetic pressure to a 
duped region of a silicon crystal, we can turn that region into a switch, and then we can turn the 
switch on and off as we choose, and let the current flow or not as we choose.

Right now, in the semiconductor fabricators of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on 
the island of Taiwan, the machines that it has bought from ASML and Applied Materials and 
programmed are carving 13 billion such semiconductor solid-state switches with attached current and 
control pathsa€”we call them a€”onto a crystal silicone chip About 2/5 of an inch wide and 2/5 of 
an inch tall. TSMCa€™ s marketing materials imply that the
smallest of the carved features is only 25 silicon atoms wide. (In actual fact, the features are 
more like ten times that sizea€”but, still, that means that there are only about 1250 free 
electrons able to move easily in a cross section.) These 13 billion transistor switches switch on 
and off, synchronously, 3,200,000,000 times a second. If all 13 billion components of this small 
chip of rock made from sand were carved correctly ,and the chip passes its tests, it will then
be  an Apple Ml microprocessor, like the one at the heart of the machine I am typing these words 
on.

These small chips of silicon rock doped with phosphorus (and boron, and other things) carved into 
microscopic paths are the single most essential pieces of our modern information-technology 
industries.

The electric telegraph is really the start of our information technology industries. In 1774 
George-Louis Le Sage used electric wires to successfully send alphabetical signals from one room of 
his house to another. In 1830 William Ritchie demonstrated that you could Use magnets to send weak 
information-carrying electrical signals from one end of a lecture hall to another, making the use 
of electricity for a near-instantaneous long-distance communication
device not just a theoretical curiosity but a potentially practical possibility. And in May 1844 
Samuel Morse sent his message a€oewhat hath God wrought?a€D over the Baltimore Washington DC 
telegraph line.

In 1906 Lee De Foresta€”who claimed that he never understood why it worked, he just knew that it 
dida€”built the first triode: the first device in which, without relatively bulky magnets involved, 
current would or would not flow through a circuit to another depending on whether or not another 
control voltage was on or off. The era of vacuum tubes and radio and all of its spinoffs plus 
stereo amplifiers and the earliest electronic computers had begun. But it was
solid-state microelectronics that enabled the flowering.

William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain are the three credited with the first transistor 
at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1947. It was an industrial research lab: that means that in 
reality hundreds if not thousands contributed. The hanging of individualsa€™ names on such 
discoveries and inventions is much more a reflection of our being designed to think in personal 
narratives then of the scientific and technological reality. Dawon Khang and
Mohamed Attila (and the Bell Labs team) built the first metal oxide semiconductor field effect 
transistora€”The one that works so much better than earlier concepts that as of now More have them 
have been made by humans than any other device by past orders of magnitude. It was Jay Lasta€™ s 
group building on the ideas of Robert Noyce and Jean Hoerni of Fairchild Semiconductor who, in 
1960, Built the first operational solid state integrated circuit. By
1964 General Microelectronics was making and selling a 120-transistor integrated circuit.

Vacuum-tube electronic switching elements were four inchesa€”100 millimeters. Transistors in 1964 
were packed 1 millimeter apart in early integrated circuits: 100 times smaller, enabling 10,000 
times as much computation power to be packed into the same space, with orders of magnitude less 
power consumption. They were made using a 50IUma€”50 micron, 1/20 of a 
millimetera€’’photolithography process, etching boron- and phosphorus-rich regions onto
the silicon substrate to make gates and circuits.

In 1965 Fairchild Semiconductor^™ s Gordon Moore observed that the number of solid-state 
microelectronic circuit elements in frontier integrated circuits had grown from 1 to 100 in the 
seven years since 1958. He made a bold ten-year highly speculative forecast. He looked forward to 
continued increases in density and a future of a€cecomponent-crammed equipmenta€D, projecting a 
1975 in which a 100 square-millimeter silicon chip would have 65,000
components on it. That would allow for a€oeelectronic techniques more generally available 
throughout all of society, performing many functions that presently are done inadequately by other 
techniques or not done at alla€D. Moore forecast, back in 1965:

Home computersa€”or at least terminals connected to a central computera€’’automatic controls for 
automobiles, and personal portable communications^! [plus] integrated circuits in digital filters 
[to] separate channels on multiplex equipmenta€! telephone circuits anda€! data processing. 
Computers will be more powerful, and will be organized in completely different waysa€!

By 1971 integrated-circuit semiconductor fabricators had taken four steps downward to a finer, SP/m 
lithography process. The first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, packed 20,000 transistor into a 
square milimetera€’’features were 200 microns apart. By 1985 the process node in the semiconductor 
fab was down to LSPXm, and the Intel 80386 microprocessor had shrunk that average 
feature-plus-separation distance down to 20. In 2005 the process node size was
down to 90nma€”nanometesa€”and the Intel Pentium 4a€™ s average feature-plus-separation distance 
was down to 0.7a€”700 nanometers. Todaya€™ s Apple-TSMC Ml packs 16 billion transistors onto a 133 
square-millimeter silicon die, with an average feature-plus-separation distance of 90 nanometers, 
and TSMCa€™ s labelling the process as the equivalent of 5nm. The 90 nanometers of average 
feature-plus-separation distance are only 450 silicon atoms
across. Todaya€™ s microelectronics are thus, in a sense, 115,000 times smaller than the 
transistors of 1985, and can pack thirteen billion times as many possible switching elements into 
the same space.

In 1979 to execute 1 MIPSa€’’million instructions per seconda€’’required 1 watt of power. By 2015 1 
watt could drive more than 1,000,000 MPIS. As components became smaller, they became faster, at 
least up until the late 2000s. Halve the size of the feature, and you can run it twice as fasta€”up 
to a point. Before 1986 microprocessor clock speed quadrupled every seven years. Then with the 
coming of the simplicity of reduced instruction sets came seventeen
years in which each quadrupling of speed took three years rather than seven. Then, after 2003, the 
quadrupling time went back to seven years, until further speed improvements hit a wall around 2013.

improving the fine resolution of its manufacturing so that it can make the features and thus the 
microprocessor smallera€”and completing a full cycle in under three years.
