Before 1870 humanity had thought that the big problem was that it could not bake a big enough pie: given limited technology and natural resources relative to population, human production could not be large enough for everyone to have <em><strong>enough.</strong></em><strong> </strong>In the long twentieth century that constraint fell away. The pie could be baked. But better technology did not help solve the problems of slicing and tasting the pie: as of today, having <em><strong>enough</strong></em><strong> </strong>remains out-of-reach for most of humanity. And those with <em><strong>enough</strong></em> have a hard time properly tasting it: many (most?) of them do not seem healthy, safe, secure, happy, or wise.</p><p>Only when the political-economic order was the post-WWII North-Atlantic social-democratic shotgun marriage of Friedrich von Hayek to Karl Polanyi, a marriage blessed by John Maynard Keynes—a marriage that itself has failed its own sustainability tests when it ran into the buzzsaw of the neoliberal challenge in the 1980s—has humanity been able to even slouch towards utopia. The explosion of our science and technological competence ought to have made our birthright. Yet we have, in many aspects, sold it for thin red-lentil stew.</p><p>Friedrich von Hayek—a genius, in some ways—was the one who most keen-sightedly observed that the market economy is tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutions. The market economy, plus industrial research labs, modern corporations, and globalization, were keys to the cage keeping humanity desperately poor. Hayek drew from this the conclusion: “the market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the market.” And he said that attitude was necessary to grasp as much of utopia as humanity could grasp. But humans disagreed. As genius Karl Polanyi saw, humans needed more rights than just property rights. The market’s treating those whom society saw as equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought social explosion after explosion, blocking the road to utopia.</p><p>Not “blessed be the name of the market” but “the market was made for man, not man for the market” was required if humanity was to even slouch towards the utopia that we ought to  grasp with our technology. But how? Since 1870 humans—John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Vladimir Lenin, and many others—have tried solutions, demanding that the market do less, or different, and other institutions do more, or other. Only government, tamed government, focusing and rebalancing things to secure more and different rights for more citizens, have brought the El Dorado of a truly human world into view. If electorates could choose such governments, slicing and tasting the pie ought to be problems as solvable as baking the pie turned out to be. But the twentieth century taught us—painfully—that that is not easy. And is it even possible?</p><p>As John Maynard Keynes wrote way back in 1924:</p><blockquote><p>We lack, more than usual a coherent scheme of progress, a tangible ideal.... It is not necessary to debate the subtleties of what justifies a man in promoting his gospel by force; for no one has a gospel. The next move is with the head, and fists must wait...</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/yet-another-yet-another-attempt-at?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/yet-another-yet-another-attempt-at?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video:</h2><p><strong>Harry Kreisler &amp;

People are never fully defined by their group memberships and continue to exercise individual agency. It may be important to understand the ways they have been shaped by their group identities, but social respect should take account of the individual choices that they make as well. Group recognition threatens not to remediate but to harden group differences…</p></blockquote><p>And I commented;</p><p><strong>The problem here is that Frank is tiptoeing perilously close to “I don’t see color” or “I don’t see gender”. Well, David Autor and I are both pretty woke as economists go. And yet at our CUNY panel with Ann Harrison and Paul Krugman, both of us interrupted Ann’s opening statement, and neither of us interrupted Paul’s. (I have been hiding in fear from Ann Harrison since: rather hard to do, since she is now Dean of Berkeley’s business school.)</strong></p><p><strong>“Wokeness” primarily involves recognizing how ethnic and gender hierarchies are woven into society, and trying to counteract them; secondarily, it is recognizing that democracy and discussion work because they pool good ideas, and so there is a strong positive benefit from having people with different experiences and thus different perspectives in the mix; and only tertiarily is it a claim that people have different rights and authorities simply by virtue of the color of their skin. (And where it does devolve into that, it tends, when the rubber hits the road, to be things like “white people really should not say ‘n——-’”, or “cross-burners like Charles Murray really shouldn’t be given more forums to spout their prejudices unbacked by good data analysis than they already have”.

And it brooks no questions on whether what’s going on even makes sense. If you’ve avoided it, I’m jealous.</p><p>On the Democratic Party—I don’t know what it is now, if it ever was anything except fundraising. Both the activist and fundraising arms now have messages that remind me of the Republican Party’s constant moral panics and culture war nonsense of the late 90s and 00s; the activists don’t offer much in the way of community because they seemingly have 150 different emergencies we must all attend to immediately. “Watch a movie, when we could be smashing the fascist regime?” Not that they’re doing that either…</p></blockquote><p>To which I replied:</p><p><strong>I do not know. </strong></p><p><strong>I may simply be very lucky and living in a bubble. After all, economics is all about peeling back the surface layer and looking at where the material resources are going. Political science is all about persuasion and making alliances. Both are likely to be extremely skeptical of “quasi-religious identity Arianism”—that’s an autocorrect error, but I am going to keep it—as, well, conscious, semi-conscious, or unconscious grifts whose purpose is to block some from resources and coalitions to gain them and enhance others’ abilities to do so.</strong></p><p><strong>But bear in mind such things can be good sources of countervailing power. One point of John Scalzi’s line that ‘playing the game of life as a white male is playing it in “easy mode”’ is that it is actually quite hard to do meritocratic ticket-punching if you are not a white male, so systems that require such ticket-punching to gain access to resources are highly likely to be discriminatory in effect, even if not in intent, and by now the “but we did not intend!” dodge is well-past its sell-by date.</strong></p><p><strong>Maybe things are very different in other departments and situations? In which turning the spotlight of recasting things in terms of resource-allocation and coalition-formation on yourselves is not a standard, instinctive move?</strong></p><p>Please, Good People of the Internet, tell me what I should think about all this…</p><p></p><h2>Paragraphs:</h2><p>Never go off the record in front of Isaac Chotiner. Nothing demonstrates more that you are an idiot and a coward, who has—was it Talleyrand said this of the Bourbons?—has learned nothing (he should have from experience) and forgotten nothing (he should let go, because he was wrong):</p><blockquote><p><strong>Isaac Chotiner &amp; Neal Katyal</strong>: <em>Unpacking the Draft Supreme Court Opinion Set to Overrule Roe</em>: ‘You [Neal] wrote a piece for the Times in 2017 called “Why Liberals Should Support Neil Gorsuch.” I am wondering how you view that piece now and whether you think liberals in the legal community have been too willing to support Republican-appointed Justices. <strong>What I said… Gorsuch for Scalia doesn’t change things very much. Indeed, there is an argument that it moved the Court a little to the left…. Kavanaugh… was very different…. The real game changer was Amy Coney Barrett for Ruth Bader Ginsburg…</strong> Right, and I know you are a fan of Coney Barrett. You said she was “brilliant” and a “lovely person” and so on. <strong>Can we go off the record for a second?</strong> I’d rather stay on the record. [Goes off the record.]… <strong>As I look back on my Gorsuch endorsement, the thing I really regret is that I had hoped Republicans would behave with more principle.</strong> In 2017? <strong>Yeah, in 2017. When I came forth for Gorsuch, Senator Lindsey Graham came up to me and said what I did was incredibly important for the institution and legitimacy of the Court. And then fast-forward to today, where that same man voted against Ketanji Brown Jackson, when easily the same thing could and would be said about her. So I really regret that there is no principle left, and no bipartisanship left in the United States Senate when it comes to Supreme Court nominations…</strong></p></blockquote><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/unpacking-the-draft-supreme-court-opinion-set-to-overrule-roe?link_id=6&amp;can_id=7677eab49ead3f512fd881abc1a73475&amp;source=email-the-neal-katyal-stop-embarrassing-yourself-2022-challenge-is-going-poorly&amp;email_referrer=email_1535062&amp;email_subject=the-neal-katyal-stop-embarrassing-yourself-2022-challenge-is-going-poorly">https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/unpacking-the-draft-supreme-court-opinion-set-to-overrule-roe?link_id=6&amp;can_id=7677eab49ead3f512fd881abc1a73475&amp;source=email-the-neal-katyal-stop-embarrassing-yourself-2022-challenge-is-going-poorly&amp;email_referrer=email_1535062&amp;email_subject=the-neal-katyal-stop-embarrassing-yourself-2022-challenge-is-going-poorly</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p>Larry, IIRC, made three predictions: (1) that there would be substantially more inflation than the median expectation thought, (2) that the inflation would last substantially longer than the median expectation thought, and (3) that because the inflation would become embedded in wage and price expectations for the future, bringing it down would require a large monetary tightening.

Now we are paying the price with rising prices, rising rates, and a serious bear market. “I do think there needs to be considerable soul-searching at the Fed as to how they missed this as badly as they did,” Summers told David Ignatius on May 31.&nbsp;To his credit, while Powell was sticking with the idea that inflation was “transitory,” Summers saw things differently as early as February 2021…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://puck.news/larry-summers-obama-a-fed-counterfactual/">https://puck.news/larry-summers-obama-a-fed-counterfactual/</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>To quote Gnæus Pompeius Magnus: “Why speak you of laws? We carry swords”:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Timothy Burke</strong>: <em>On the Brink of the Cornfield</em>: ‘Power as privilege…. Power as authority…. Liz Cheney… is willing to take a strong stand against Trump, because Trump stands for a third kind of power. It’s the kind of power used to wish people into a cornfield. It’s like the cliche that Trump is a poor man’s idea of a rich man: he is striving for the kind of power associated with adolescent fantasy, where power is getting to do whatever you want…. People who are invested in power derived from institutions, systems and rules stand against him…. They understand that when someone gets the power to wish everybody into the cornfield, no other kind of power matters any more. All there is left is the person who gets to do whatever he wants, the fluffers and enablers who hope to benefit by being the tools of his will, and the mini-me’s who hope that there will be fractal versions of cornfield-wishing available to them further down the line…. The cornfield-wishing kind of power has to regard all rules, all constraints, anything that stands in its way, as unimportant. The sad truth is that the more boldly this kind of power expresses that attitude, the more it tends to make that wish come true…. There are still marriages and gender and families in Peakesville Ohio, none of which provide anything to stop or impede little Anthony from wishing people into the cornfield and bringing snow down on the crops…. Aunt Amy had one chance to grab a fireplace poker and take Anthony out in Peakesville.
