Paragraphs:

Peter F. Drucker: Management'. a€~To be sure, Friedmana€™ s argument that business is an economic 
institution and should stick to its economic task is well takena€!. But it is also clear that 
social responsibility cannot be
evaded. It is not only that the public demands it. It is not only that society needs it. The fact 
remains that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers. If the managers of 
our major institutions, and
especially of business, do not take responsibility for the common good, no one else can or willa€!

Judit Zapor: Laura Polanyi 1882d€“1957: Narratives of a Life'. a€~ Although we have no way of 
confirming the actual steps she had taken, it seems that Laura Polanyi had been instrumental in her 
daughter [Eve]s eventual
release [from the Soviet GULAG]; no small feat, given the times and circumstances. As an unintended 
by-product, Eva Striker's imprisonment served as the inspiration for her childhood friend, Arthur 
Koestlers

novel, Darkness at Noon. The series of subsequent dramatic events included Laura Polanyia€™ s own 
arrest by the Gestapo in Vienna in the aftermath of the Anschluss, and ended with her eventual 
success in helping her
three children, her seventy-year-old husband, numerous nephews, nieces and friends to reach 
America. The one tragic failure concerned her younger sister, Sophie, who, with her husband and two 
of their three children,
perished in concentration campsa€!

Peter Drucker (1978): Adventures of a Bystander. a€~[Karl Polanyi] opened one of the trunks and an 
enormous mass of books, papers, magazines, letters cascaded out. In the same bellowing voice he 
shouted at top speed,
with the words tumbling out like volcanic rocks: a€oeFor the annual review issue wea€™ll have four 
lead articles. One on what goes on in China. The civil war there between Chang Tzo-lin and Chiang 
Kai-shek and all the
other warlords,a€D and he chanted all those nonsense syllables again, a€oeis the most important 
event of the next five years. And then wea€™ 11 have a piece on the fall of agricultural prices on 
the world marketsa€”it
foreshadows a serious economic depression in a few yearsa€™ time. The third piece will deal with 
Stalin in Russia; Leninism is dead and with it the Communist Revolution. There is a new Oriental 
despotism and the
reintroduction                                                                                      
              of serfdom. And finally wea€™ 11 have a piece about an English economist, Keynes is 
his name; the man, you know, who wrote about the Economic Consequences of the Peace in 1919a€“20. 
Hea€™ s coming
out with new and exciting theories that stand traditional economics on its head.a€D He opened the 
other trunk and another avalanche of books, pamphletsa€!

Jere Moorman: REVIEW: David Cesarani, Arthur Koestler: The Homeless Mind. New York: The Free Press, 
1998. Pp. x + 646. ISBN 0a€“684a€“86720a€“6, $30.00, hardcover:. a€~Another member of the Polanyi 
clan
as being crucially involved in the development of Koestlera€™ s thoughta€!. Eva Strikera€! daughter 
of Michaela€™ s older sister Laura (Mausi), furnished Koestler with the account which inspired him 
to write Darkness at
Noon. Eva followed her fiancA©e, the physicist Alex Weissberg, to Kharkov, Ukraine, where they were 
married in 1932. Their home served Koestler as his base of operations when he traveled to the 
Soviet Union in
1932a€“33 as a recently minted communist to write a book on the progress being made in the Soviet 
worlda€!. The trip Koestler took into Soviet central Asia was particularly disturbing to hima€!. 
The recent convert was
taken  aback; his faith in Communism began to ebb. The coup de grace of Koestlera€™ s 
identification with Communism occurred when he next saw Eva in 1938 after she was freed from the 
USSR. She told him the story of
how, during the Soviet purges, she was charged with spying and sabotage and then had been arrested 
and imprisoned for sixteen months. With the help of Weissberg (from whom she had been separated in 
1934) and the
Austrian consul, she was released, but then Weissberg was arrested. In turn, Koestler and Polanyi 
were among a loose network of those who worked to free Weissberg, a task that eventually was 
successfula€!.

Koestler[a€™ s] hear[ing]a€! Evaa€™ s accounta€! helped precipitate his writing of Darkness at 
Noon^\
