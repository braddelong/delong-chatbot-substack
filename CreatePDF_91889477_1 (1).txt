Slouching Towards Utopia: The Economic History of the Twentieth Century <bit.ly/3pP3Krk>:

Saadia Zahidi: Most Recommended Books of 2022: a€~In this sweeping overview of the period 
stretching from 1870 to 2010, DeLong explains the forces that drove the modern eraa€™ s 
unprecedented progress in technology and expansion of wealtha€!. Only through the shotgun marriage 
of Friedrich von Hayek and Karl Polanyi a€“ a marriage blessed by John Maynard Keynes a€“ have we 
been able even to slouch toward utopia,
and that marriage has failed its own sustainability testsa€!. We got climate change, economic 
depressions and recessions, perpetual uncertainty, inequality, and deepening social 
polarizationa€!a€D

My guess, trying to use Amazon Sales Rank as a daily indicator, is that worldwide all-format sales 
of Slouching Towards Utopia will cross 29,000 tomorrow, and I am very much hoping to hit 30,000 by 
Christmasa€!

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.5%-points last week. That should be the last such 
raise.

The Core CPIa€’’consumer prices with the volatile food and energy sectors taken outa€”rose by only 
0.2% in America in November. That would be a 2.4% annual rate. Food and energy inflation came out 
lower. The Headline CPIa€”the entire indexa€”rose by only 0.1% in November. That makes two months 
of very surprisingly lower-than-expected inflation rates. The reduction in inflation has been 
powered by good prices: goods prices have now fallen over
the past two months by a total of 0.9%.

The only piece of inflation news that does not show a clear and significant declining trend is 
services inflation. But even in that there appears to be signs of good news: services inflation 
averaged 0.6% per montha€”7.1% per yeara€”over the six months before November. It was 0.4%a€”4.8% 
per yeara€”in November. We can guess that the decline in services inflation will continue for the 
next six months. Rent increases have moderated and may be
disappearing, but the change in the housing-cost trajectory, although baked in the cake, is not yet 
in the November numbers at all.

And it is not as though wage pressure is pulling services inflation up: nominal wage inflation has 
been less than services price inflation for pretty much all of 2022. While the labor market is 
a€oeoverheateda€D in the sense that nominal wage increases are still running above 5% per year, 
this appears more a response to price inflation than a driver of it. Even at todaya€™ s low 
unemployment rate, workers in aggregate do not appear to have the market power to
demand a larger share of the income pie.

The inflation we have had over the past two years has been, largely, a good thinga€”or, rather, a 
necessary consequence of a very good thing. Not to have had an inflation surge as we reopened the 
economy after the plaguea€”that would have been to run unacceptably high risks of a repeat of the 
disastrously slow recovery of the Obama years. Moreover, we needed wage inflation in the 
goods-producing, logistics, and information sectors in order to pull workers
returning to work into the sectors that needed to expand to get the economy to full employment 
given the altered post-plague shape of demand. And we needed inflation at the bottleneck breaks in 
supply chains to incentivize their repair.

The Team Transitory narrative of 2021 was that we needed to re-join the highway at speed, that when 
you accelerate you leave rubber on the road, and that it is silly to be surprised by and then 
complain about the skidmarks. A central bank with credibility should not obsess about hitting its 
inflation target every single year, but rather let inflation vary from year to year in whatever 
pattern, maximizes, employment, purchasing power, and growth. The Team
Transitory narrative of 2021 was that the pattern looked like what we had seen in the late 1940s 
when we wheeled the economy away from war and into civilian production, and then again what we had 
seen in the early 1950s when we wheeled the economy into the configuration necessary to fight the 
permanent Cold War: in both those cases inflation spiked and quickly receded.

The fear in 2021 was that the inflationary spike would get incorporated into expectations of future 
price changes, and lead to its entrenchment in worker demands for continual wage increases, and so 
return us to the stagflation of the 1970s.

This fear gained great urgency in 2022, when Vladimir Putina€™ s attack on Ukraine produced 
substantial energy and food price shocks. The double whammy of commodity supply-shock and after 
plague-reopening shocks greatly raised the risks that expectations of inflation would become 
entrenched, generate a repeat of the 1970s, and require a 1982-magnitude recession to restore the 
economy to balance.
But now it seems that the supply shock and the reopening shock may have passed their peaks. And, so 
far, there is no sign anywhere in the economy of inflation expectations becoming entrenched.

2019            2020            2021            2022

Thus over the past two months the balance of risks has shifted. There still remain grave risks on 
both sides. But as of now the principal risk is not that the Fed will do too little in the way of 
interest-rate increases to generate an economic soft landing, but that it has already done too much.

MUST-READ: Ken White Is a Free-Speech Pedant:

This is very, very good indeed. Ken White is almost always very very thoughtful, and has the good 
kind of lawyer minda€”one that makes very important, very useful, and very thoughtful fine and 
not-so-fine distinctions:

Ken White: In Defense Of Free Speech Pedantry: a€~FSC [Free Speech Culture] and FSR [Free Speech 
Rights] are not only distinct, they can conflict. Put another way, FSC arguments often involve 
asking Group A not to do or say xa€”which they have the FSR to doa€”so that Group B is not chilled 
or deterred from doing or saying ya€l. That argumenta€l should be made out in the open, anda€l 
being precise helps us do thata€l.
When I denounce students for shouting down a speaker and preventing them from speaking, I should be 
clear that Ia€™m saying that the studentsa€™ behavior may exceed their FSR (because reasonable 
time, place, and manner restrictions are permissible) and that Ia€™m making a FSC appeal for the 
students to refrain from using their expression to dictate what other people can say and what other 
people can listen toa€l.

Finallya€l I think sometimesa€l a€oehate speech is not free speechaCO is an appeal to S[peech 
]D[ecency]a€!. Therea€™ s an idealized set of speech that may be controversial or disagreeable but 
ultimately is not cruel and contemptible, and that racist speech is outside of that set. This is a 
perfectly legitimate debate. Ita€™ s fine to say that using a racial epithet is usually protected 
by FSR, that in some circumstances it ought to be
protected as a matter of FSC (for instance, in allowing a€oeHuckleberry Finna€D to be taught to 
high school children notwithstanding its use of epithets), and that people who use it to belittle 
and demean ought to be called out as a matter of SD. Once again, clarity about values helps 
illuminate the different rights and different interests in playa€l
