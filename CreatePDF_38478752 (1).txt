First:

The curious thing about the graph below is this: some of the rapidly-growing prices 
categoriesa€”medical-care services, childcare and nursery school, food and beveragesa€”are 
overwhelmingly personal and personal-care services that are still largely one-on-one and that we 
should have expected to roughly track wages; some (college textbooks) are the result of market 
power being exercised; some (college tuition) are the result of government withdrawal of
financial support for higher education; and some (hospital services) are the result of a 
complicated cost-allocation game in a sector that is experiencing remarkable although not 
especially cost-reducing technological progress (it is, rather, capability-expanding technological 
progress). These are different processes than the normal technological progress ones (cars, 
furnishings, clothing) or the infotech revolutionary ones (TVs, toys, software, cellphones).

We should, IMHO, be talking systems reform rather than tech application here:

Marc Andreessen: Interview with Noah Smith: a€~Housing, education, and health care are each 
ferociously complex, but what they have in common is skyrocketing prices in a world where 
technology is driving down prices of most other products and services. (See chart below.) I think 
we should build in the next decade new technologies, businesses, and industries that break these 
price curves a€“ and in fact reverse them, and make these three primary
markers of the American dream easier and easier for regular people to attaina€!

Paragraphs:

It is always so very, very hard to read and understand paragraphs like this one from Thomas 
Jefferson. Just what is the guy thinking, as he writes from Monticello?

Does he think that African-Americans on his plantation are not included in a€oethe mass of 
mankinda€D? Does he think slavery is an honorable and appropriate and beneficial estate for 
African-Americans, just as Aristotle thought it was for non-Helenea€™ s?Does he think slavery and 
the slave trade were the result of Americaa€™ s high land-labor ratio, and that mass manumission 
will become the rule in a generation and so slavery will sublime away? He
keeps his counsela€”save for the occasional a€oefirebell in the nighta€D.

I gotta find some time to reread Edmund S. Morgana€™ s American Slavery, American Freedom^.}:

Thomas Jefferson: To Roger Weightman: a€~The general spread of the light of science has already 
laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles 
on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace 
of god. These are grounds of hope for others. For ourselves, let the annual return of this day 
forever refresh our recollections of these rights,
and an undiminished devotion to thema€!. With my regret that ill health forbids me the 
gratification of an acceptance, be pleased to receive for yourself, and those for whom you write, 
the assurance of my highest respect and friendly attachmentsa€!

Absolutely brutal against the plutocrat-wannabees of North Carolina:

Joe Killian: ^."Meeting with Nikole Hannah Jones for an interview this week made me reflect on my 
June interview with Walter Hussmana€!. Hussman saying to me, repeatedly, a€oeWell, Joe, you and I 
are both reportersa€!a€D or a€oeWell, since wea€™re both journalists I think you understanda€!a€D 
This is a common rhetorical device. Find an area of common ground, assert affinity, create a 
bonda€!. After journalism and
business school, Hussman was briefly a reporter before, at age 27, he was made publisher of a paper 
in the family media dynasty he would go on to inherit. When I was 27 years old I was a beat 
reporter on a daily newspaper going to fires, murder scenes, protests and government meetings. I 
practically slept in the newsroom, which was much nicer than my apartment, and took side gigs to 
afford to sleep indoors and eat while reporting.
That sort of experiencea€”slowly clawing your way up from smaller to larger newsrooms, being 
mentored by veteran reporters, slowly earning bigger beats and more responsibility over many 
yearsa€”is what Ia€™ m supposed to assume I share with someone who says a€oel was a reporter.a€D 
Those are, as it happens, experiences I do share with Nikole Hannah-Jonesa€!. Neither of us were, 
in our mid twenties, handed news outlets
by                                                                                                  
                                                                                                   
our families. Neither of us were allowed to lose enormous amounts of money in years-long, heavily 
political newspaper wars until we crushed our rivals, assumed dominance and expanded our 
intergenerational empires. I suspected this may be one of the things that most offended 
Hannah-Jones about Hussman questioning her media values and credentials, whether she was fit to 
teach young journalists. And my interview with her
confirmed ita€!

Given that we have undershot our inflation target by a cumulative 10% over the past decadea€”by 
something like 0.8%/yeara€”it seems likely that a 3% inflation target would produce 2.2% average 
inflation:

Jason Furman: Interview with Noah Smith: a€~There is a better possibilitya€! that we will have a 
few years of inflation well above 2 percent. If this happensa€! at its next framework review about 
four years from now it could end up ratifying reality with a higher inflation target like a 2 to 3 
percent range or 3 percent inflation. So far the bond markets and professional forecasters are 
giving very little weight to this possibility and expect
them to keep inflation to 2 percent over the longer term. Ia€™ m much less sure and place at least 
a 20 percent chance of a higher inflation target, but possibly that is wishful thinking on my part 
because I would like them to raise the inflation targeta€!

I strongly question this a€oemodern economic growtha€! probably began in the seventeenth 
centurya€!a€D I would date it, worldwide, to 1500 and the coming of the Imperial-Commercial Age: 
the caravel, global trade cheaper by a factor of five, the Columbian Exchange, and the European 
seaborne empires. England was just late to take advantagea€”a century behind Spain and Portugal. 
(And, yes, some ramping-up of invention and innovation in Europe as
well.) And, no, I dona€™t think it had much to do with a€ceinstitutionsa€D or the Glorious 
Revolution: those had powerful impacts later on (and earlier on as well, if you buy DeLong & 
Shleifer: Princes & Merchants).

The puzzle I see here is: why no rapid demographic expansion with population rapidly recovering 
from the Black Death nadir? Nutrition levels look very good, and equivalent real wages in the 1800s 
saw very rapid demographic expansion. Are builders unrepresentative of peasants (that free builders 
are able to bargain for high wages given their high productivity as a result of resource abundance 
does not mean that it was easy for the marginal peasant to do so)?
Was the disease environment simply so poisonous? Paul Bouscasse, Emi Nakamura, and JA3n Steinsson 
are working on this, I know, anda€”lo and behold: they have a new draft, which is something else I 
must now find time to read chttps://eml.berkeley.edu/~jsteinsson/papers/malthus.pdf>:

Gregory Clark: The Condition of the Working-Class in England, 1209a€“2003: a€~Real wages of male 
building craftsmen and laborers in England for 1209a€“2003a€! implications for our understanding of 
both the Malthusian era, and of the Industrial Revolutiona€!. From 1200 until 1800 there was no 
trend increase in real wagesa€!. Modern economic growth, fuelled by productivity advance, probably 
began in the seventeenth
century before the institutional reforms of the Glorious Revolution of 1688a€L Human capital 
interpretations of the Industrial Revolution, formalized by Becker et al. (1990), Galor and Weil 
(2000) and Lucas (2002), as presently constructed, conflict with the empirical record. Human 
capital accumulation in England began in an era when the market rewards to skill acquisition had 
fallen substantially from their medieval peaka€!
