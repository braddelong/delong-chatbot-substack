FIRST: That Putina€™s Attack on Ukraine May Trigger a European Recession Is Not the Most Important 
Thing:

But it is a thing. And it is a thing that me, playing my position, should take note of:

Barry Eichengreen:

Barry Eichengreen: Europea€™s Economy on a Knife Edge'. a€~Before Russian President Vladimir 
Putina€™ s attack on Ukraine, Europea€™ s recovery from the damage wrought by the COVIDa€“19 
pandemic was solidifyinga€!. But then the war dented consumer confidence by heightening uncertainty 
and raising energy and commodity pricesa€!. More costly energy will no doubt be a drag on growth. 
But if Russian gas
continues to flow, higher prices will not bake in a recessiona€!. But using less gas is one thing; 
using none at all is quite another. In the latter scenario, gas-powered factories wona€™ t be 
economizing; they will be shutting downa€!. Whether gas supplies are suspended depends entirely on 
Putin, who could decide to terminate shipments in retaliation against Western sanctions. He may 
need the revenues, but this would not be the first

time that anger and pride trumped economic logic. If the West makes payments not to Gazprombank but 
into escrow accounts, Putin will lose his last remaining incentive to keep the gas flowinga€!. If 
Putin allows his army to continue committing atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, Western 
European publics and policymakers will unite against him. Given their countrya€™ s history, Germans 
will not be able to sit back comfortably, in
homes heated by Russian gasa€!.

It is easy for an American, heated by natural gas from Texas and the Dakotas, to say that Europe 
should endure a recession in order to ratchet up the pressure on Putin. But if President Joe 
Bidena€™ s administration and the US Congress think it crucial to intensify the pressure on Russia, 
then they can make it worth Europea€™ s while. Europe will take the lead in Ukrainea€™ s postwar 
reconstruction. The logistics are easiera€!. But if
Europe is the logical party to do the legwork and administer the aid, then the United States can 
provide the bulk of the finance, beyond that portion financed by escrow accounts and Russiaa€™ s 
other external assets. This will be an appropriate humanitarian gesture once the war is over. But a 
US commitment now to compensate Europe for the steps it must take, starting with a ban on imports 
of Russian oil and gas, is also a way to
incentivize it to help bring the war to an early enda€!

ngreen-2022-04>

I endorse this from Barry-down-the-hall 100%. Ukrainian reconstruction should be financed 100% out 
of Russiaa€™ s seized external assets, and then by the United States. Europeans should start paying 
for Russian gas into escrow accounts on which Ukraine reconstruction has a lien. Given the pictures 
and videos that have come out and will come out of Ukraine, and given the willingness of European 
voters to look at them in a way they would not look at
pictures from Syria or Grozny, there is a very high probability that European politicians will 
ultimately be forced to act. It is much better for them to take control of the action now rather 
than to be reduced to the position of mid-1800s French politician AndrA© Ledru-Rollin: aCceThere go 
my people! And I must follow them, for I am their leader!a€D

Those steps taken now should greatly concentrate the minds of Putina€™ s circle about the need to 
bring a war that Russia will be paying for both sides of to a rapid end. But Putin himself needs a 
line of retreat. The line of retreat I would offer him would be a Second Yalta Conference: 
International recognition of the redrawing of borders to place Crimea, Lohan's, and Donetsk on the 
Russian side; in return, immediate Ukraine accession to the EU and to NATO,
plus Russian assets paying for Ukraine reconstruction (but not subsequent development); and the US 
funding a Marshall Plan for Ukraine.

Such a second Yalta conference will be generally condemned in a generation as a betrayal of the 
people living in Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk. And it will be rightly so condemned.
But I think it may well be the best thing we can do, given the situation.

One does not, after all, walk into a negotiation with a crazy man controlling nuclear weapons and 
expect roses and unicorns and rainbows.

Five reasons China's productivity slowed down

Ita€™ s always an interesting experience to read books about Chinaa€™ s economy from before 2018 or 
so. So many world-shaking events have changed the story since then a€” Trumpa€™ s trade war, Covid, 
Xia€™ s industrial crackdowns, the real estate bust, lockdowns, Russiaa€™ s invasion of Ukraine. 
Reading predictions of Chinaa€™ s evolution from before these events occurred is a little like

Paragraphs:

Truly excellent paper from Chenzi!:

Chenzi Xu: Reshaping Global Trade: The Immediate & Long-Run Effects of Bank Failures'. a€~I show 
that a disruption to the financial sector can reshape the patterns of global trade for decades. I 
study the first modern global banking crisis originating in London in 1866 and collect archival 
loan records that link multinational banks headquartered there to their lending abroad. Countries 
exposed to bank failures in London immediately
exported significantly less and did not recover their lost growth relative to unexposed places. 
Their market shares within each destination also remained significantly lower for four decades. 
Decomposing the persistent market-share losses shows that they primarily stem from lack of 
extensive-margin growth, as the financing shock caused importers to source more from new trade 
partnerships. Exporters producing more substitutable
goods, those with little access to alternative forms of credit, and those trading with more distant 
partners experienced more persistent losses, consistent with the existence of sunk costs and the 
importance of finance for intermediating tradea€!

I think this is, flatly, wrong. The key question is whether a liberal-democratic order will in the 
end be more durable and more attractive to those who wield social power, both over material 
resources and over the means of persuading others, then an authoritarian-plutocratic order. I used 
to be confident that it would be. I thought the means of persuasion were limited in their efficacy. 
I thought that plutocrats would recognize that kleptocrats are not their allies, but
rather predators to be feared. I thought they would conclude that it it was better to allow the 
moderation of autocracy in order to gain the protection offered by liberal society. And I thought 
that the demos could not be perpetually grifted.

But the past decade is leading me to rethink:

Megan Gibson: Francis Fukuyama: We Could Be Facing the End ofa€oeThe End of Historyd€d 
a€~Fukuyamaa€! said that when he wrote his thesis he perhaps didna€™t fully appreciate the concept 
of a€oepolitical decay: the idea that once you became a modern democracy, you could also go 
backwardsa€Da€!. Fukuyama has also been willing to, as he put it in a recent essay, a€oestick [his] 
neck outa€D over the likely geopolitical
consequences of the war in Ukraine. Chief among his predictions: Russia will lose the war, perhaps 
spectacularly, and this defeat will help the West get out of a€oeour funk about the declining state 
of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, thanks to a bunch of brave Ukrainians.a€D For 
those interested in the stability of the international order, ita€™ s an optimistic, even 
reassuring, vision of the wara€™ s potential
outcomea€!.   His a€oeultimate nightmarea€D, he said, is a world in which China and Russia work in 
harness with one another, perhaps with China bolstering Russiaa€™ s war and Beijing launching its 
own invasiona€”of Taiwan. If that were to happen, and be successful, Fukuyama said, a€oethen you 
would really be living in a world that was being dominated by these non-democratic powers. If the 
United States and the rest of the
West couldna€™ t stop that from happening, then that really is the end of the end of historya€Ua€!

Put a tickler here that I need to return to this. There is an awful lot here, and I need to decide 
what to think about it:

Noah Smith: Five Reasons Chinaa€™ s Productivity [Growth] Slowed Down'. a€~Productivity growth is 
the thread that ties together the entire story of the Chinese economy since 2008. Basic economic 
theory says that eventually the growth benefits of capital accumulation hit a wall, and you have to 
improve technology and/or efficiency to keep growth going. Some countries, like Japan, South Korea, 
Singapore, and Taiwan, have done
this successfully, and are now rich; other, like Thailand, failed to do ita€!. For several decades, 
Chinese productivity growth looked like Japana€™ s or Koreaa€™ sa€!. But slightly before Xi came to 
power, it downshifted to look a bit more like Thailanda€!. The question then becomes: Why has 
Chinese productivity growth slowed to a crawl?a€!

Tailwindsa€!. As you reach the frontier, the remaining technologies you need to absorb to keep 
growing productivity quickly become more and more complicateda€!. Demographicsa€!. China began to 
age rapidly right around 2010a€!. Rapid urbanization^! raises productivity a lota€!. So in the last 
decade, three big tailwinds that were driving Chinese productivity growth probably dried up. And 
therea€™ s not really anything that Xi
Jinping or any leader can do about that.

But there are probably other factors dragging down Chinaa€™ s productivity growth as well, that 
might be more amenable to policy fixes. Low research productivitya€!. Unfortunately, research input 
doesna€™ t always lead to research outputa€!. Zhang, Zhang & Zhaoa€!. Misallocation of 
resourcesa€!. A lot of this spending is being done by state-owned companies that are just throwing 
money at a€ceresearcha€D because the
government tells them toa€!. Limited export marketsaC!. Ia€™ m a big fan ofa€! the idea of 
a€ceexport disciplinea€Da€!. A shift from export-led growth to growth led by domestic investment^!. 
If [there are] productivity benefits from exporting, then this is also a challenge for long-term 
growtha€!.

Not enough consumption^!. Consumers have a preference for differentiated goods that spurs companies 
to develop new products, increase quality, offer new features, and so ona€!. Over the past decade, 
China has been building a lot of buildings and a lot of infrastructure^!.

In the last three years, Xi has undertaken a second, more destructive effort to reshape ChinaaC™ s 
industrial landscape. Instead of simply boosting the industries he wants, he has attacked the 
industries he doesna€™ t wanta€!. An economy where the leader is always smashing companies and 
industries he doesna€™ t like is inherently an economy full of risk. Yes, Chinese engineers and 
managers will obey Xia€™ s will and go into the
industries he wants them to go into. But the loss of entrepreneurship and initiative might make 
this a pyrrhic victory. In other words, escaping Chinaa€™ s low-productivity-growth trap is going 
to be tough, and Xia€™ s strategy doesna€™ t fill me with a ton of confidencea€!

I do not think that this works. Liberalism requires rough equality of social power to be any good, 
yesa€”which means a great narrowing of economic disparities. Democracy is almost surely much better 
than not-democracy. But a democracy that does not respect your liberal rights wherever you find 
yourself in disagreement with the majority definitely does not advance your human dignity. Does 
non-liberal leftism turns into a better form of liberalism, rather than
an alternative:

Matthew McManus: A Critical Legal Examination of Liberalism and Liberal Rights'. a€™ This book has 
two aims. First, to provide a critical legal examination of the liberal state and liberal rights in 
the law, and secondly, to present a systematic alternative to liberal approaches to both the law 
and rights, grounded in a left-wing conception of human dignity. At the opening of the 21st 
century, a remarkable thing happened. Liberalism,
once considered the only doctrine left standing at the end of history, began to face renewed 
competition from both the political left and the post-modern conservative right. This book argues 
that the way forward is not to abandon, but to radicalize, the potential of the liberal project. 
Analysing major theoretical positions in order to build a critical genealogy of liberal rights, 
McManus lucidly develops a left-wing alternative to the classic
liberal approach to rights drawing on the traditions of liberal egalitarians and deliberative 
democracy theory. Societies, he argues, should be committed to advancing the human dignity of all 
through the enshrinement of certain rights into positive state law, the expansion of democracy, and 
a resolute commitment to economic equalitya€!

Mike Ford would have given to us if this were a better world:
