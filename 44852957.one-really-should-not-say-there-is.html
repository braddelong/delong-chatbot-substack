Masks and avoiding crowding together in effective batcaves are not in short supply worldwide. So let me second Claudia on this: there is no either/or tradeoff here. </p><p>To say that we should focus on vaccines “instead of” masks and social distancing and other extremely cheap and easy non-pharmaceutical measures to deal with the fact that there are three days during which you are infectious before you know you are—well, the “either/or” in place of “both/and” is something I find hard to interpret except as a form of two-sided affinity fraud. Suppose you, on the one hand, don’t want to come across as an anti-science COVID denialist who has unmoored himself from reality. Suppose you, on the other hand, don’t want to come across as an enemy of human liberty and a servant of the TOTAL STATE. Pro-vaccine and anti-mask is a position you might come up with.</p><p>At least it is better than anti-vaccine and pro-horse dewormer:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Claudia Sahm</strong>: <em>‘Tyler Cowen: “I</em> <em>say it is third doses</em> we should be doubling down on, not masks… emerging science on third doses is much stronger, and most countries have been dropping the ball on that one.“ I don’t understand the either/or on mask vs vaccines debates. I absolutely, positively think we should vaccinate the world. and I would drop all the intellectual property protections on the vaccine to get mass production in developing countries…. One thing I think about is the social signaling value of masks. Covid is a collective problem that the United States and other vaccine-access-rich countries have turned into an individual choice battle (again, thanks a lot to libertarians for banning the word ”society“). Impossible to know who is vaxxed, so I take comfort when I walk into the grocery store and people are masked. I live in a high vax area and masks are not mandatory. to me masks say ”I care about you too." makes me feel better. ANYTHING that makes us feel better is a godsend…. PS… Tyler has come a long way from asking what epidemiologists’ GRE scores were. see, he has emotions too, and Easter Sunday 2020 (really that was the day he chose to blast them) was an emotional time for all of us…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/Claudia_Sahm/status/1464947708146368524&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;\&quot;I say it is third doses we should be doubling down on, not mask ... emerging science on third doses is much stronger, and most countries have been dropping the ball on that one.\&quot; <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@tylercowen</span>\n\nI don't understand the either/or on mask vs vaccines debates. &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;Claudia_Sahm&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Claudia Sahm&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sun Nov 28 13:22:05 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:0,&quot;like_count&quot;:31,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/11/an-update-on-the-mask-debate.html&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2adb84e7-7fd1-47d8-ad5c-22ea602f2561_2000x2000.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;An update on the mask debate - Marginal REVOLUTION&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;I am long since tired of this debate, and I see that a lot of people are not joining it in the best of faith.

Western intervention in the 19th century had a substantial role in creating China’s economy today. Offering the year 1842 as the turning point that explains the Chinese economy we see today pre-dates 1921 (foundation of the Communist Party of China), 1949 (foundation of People’s Republic of China), and 1978 (beginning of market reforms).

That’s tricky, because it depends on what you were buying. In the second half of the 14th century, a pound sterling would: Support the lifestyle of a single peasant laborer for half a year, or that of a knight for a week. Or buy: Three changes of clothing for a teenage page (underclothes not included) or Twelve pounds of sugar or A carthorse or Two cows or An inexpensive bible or ten ordinary books or Rent a craftsman’s townhouse for a year or Hire a servant for six months. It should be obvious from the above list that the conversion rate depends a great deal on what you buy. A husbandman or yeoman servant spent most of his budget on food and clothing, which have become relatively cheap since the industrial revolution. For that basket of goods, a pound sterling might buy $500 worth of goods today. On the other hand, a knight or noble might spend a quarter of his income on servants, and much of the rest on handmade luxury goods, things that were relatively cheap then and expensive today. For that bundle of goods, a pound might buy $1,800 worth of goods today…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="http://willscommonplacebook.blogspot.com/2008/07/buying-power-of-14th-century-money.html">http://willscommonplacebook.blogspot.com/2008/07/buying-power-of-14th-century-money.html</a>&gt;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Philippe Lemoine</strong>: <em>Population Structure &amp; Transmission</em>: ‘If the population can be divided into networks of quasi-homogeneous mixing populations that are internally well-connected but only loosely connected to each other, the effective reproduction number can undergo large fluctuations even in the absence of behavioral changes….
