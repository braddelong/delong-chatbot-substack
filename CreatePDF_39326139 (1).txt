12)Republican campaign tactician Lee Atwater said, back in 1981 in an interview with Alexander P. 
Lamis, that Americaa€™ s Republican Party was not a racist organization because if it were, 
suppressing the African-
American vote and reversing a€oethe Voting Rights Act would have been a central part of keeping the 
South [electing Republicans]. And now thev don't have to do that All vou gotta do to keep the South 
is for Reagan to run

Why male supremacy became so firmly established millennia ago, back in the Agrarian Age, is not 
obvious: Especially since the degree of patriarchy varied widely. Women appear to have had as 
visible a place in Ancient
Egypt as mena€’’although the powerful women are almost invariably linked to powerful men. In 
southeast Asia, the southern chunk of Africa, and in much of South America much inheritance was 
matrilineal, and more social
power accrued to women (and aunts and uncles) and less, relatively, to fathers. Places in which 
resources were scarce, and thus property valuable, tended to place much more attention on 
controlling female fertility and
chastity. There appears to me at least to be something to the idea that patriarchy was greatly 
strengthened in places influenced by the Indo-European migration and cultural transmission that 
came out of the steppes. And then
there are the places where one man-many wives and female seclusion are the ideal. To dip your toe 
into all this, see Alice Evans (2021), Ten Thousand Years of Patriarchy <https ://www.draliceevans

The underpinnings of male supremacy did begin to erode before 1870’. And yet, as I wrote, it is 
astonishing to me at least how long it took. Perhaps women needed to have enough leisure from the 
falling birthrate and
improved within-the-household technology and also enough day-to-day freedom to form dense social 
networks with other women before feminists could organize and demand equal rights for women? And 
without a demand,
why would men supply?
