Much of the piece revolves around whether demand (stimulus/Fed) or supply (pandemic) is primarily driving inflation….</p></blockquote><p><strong>Brad DeLong</strong>: <em>’I am not sure</em> that the supply/demand division framing makes a lot of sense. Inflation is the result of a supply/demand mismatch. This mismatch could be transient and healthy—a side effect of the good things of rapidly rejoining highway traffic at speed and wheeling the economy toward a more goods- and deliverator-heavy configuration. This mismatch could be long-lasting and unhealthy. The question is which. And the answer to that question turns on whether the economy has lost its expectational inflation anchor: Do people still expect inflation to be about 2%? Or do people think inflation is up-for-grabs and recent past inflation (or recent past plus a little more) is your best guess for what inflation will be in the future? My bet is that the 5/5 series from FRED is our best guide to what the relevant people are thinking. &amp; the 5/5 has not (yet) moved…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/convos/1513507454033797126">https://threadreaderapp.com/convos/1513507454033797126</a>&gt;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>FIRST: SubStack:</h2><p>I kinda think that one should not read Tiffany Hsu of the New York Times on SubStack.

Is Substack Worth It for Writers?</em>: ‘Twitter… strong network effects…. The fact that there can be only one Twitter gives the platform a degree of social responsibility that it would not otherwise have. Its content decisions… necessarily exercise huge sway…. Twitter is one of society’s mezzanine institutions, whose micro-actions carry macro importance…. Clones of Substack are proliferating quickly. These platforms are really more like newsstands than public squares…. Although I really really really do not like antivaxxers, I don’t get mad that Substack still allows them on its platform. Substack isn’t making the world worse….</p><p>The more distinctive your voice and your perspective is, the more you should take a look at Substack…. Writing for a living is not a good career—if you want a good salary, follow the cliché and learn to code. Or go work for private equity. But if you really just love to write, and you’d like to get paid a bit more than your job is paying you, and if you’re confident that you have an audience who likes you a lot more than they like the average writer, then Substack is a pretty darn good deal…</p></blockquote><p>My view is that the red line for a platform should be: does it have an algorithm that up-votes misinformation as it chases clickbait in an attempt to make money? The things that a platform should direct its readers to our things that (a) are true, (b) that the readers want to see and enjoy seeing, and (c) make them happier and better people afterwards. That will not be what maximizes ad revenue. So we all have a duty to deprive platforms with algorithms that up-vote misinformation of revenue, and of attention-oxygen.</p><p>Things could change. But at the moment ‘Stack is, as <strong>Chad Orzel</strong>l says, <strong>“</strong>a really convenient and user-friendly platform…. Substack being set up as a bunch of largely self-contained individual sites makes it less troubling to me that they also host Bad People.

Here we have an ingenious explanation for why it was that Japan marketized, but did not machinize:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Yuzuru Kumon</strong>: <em>How Landownership Equality Created a Low Wage Society: Pre-industrial Japan, 1600–1870</em>: ’Despite its sophistication, Early Modern Japan, 1600–1868, had among the lowest real wage levels ever recorded, half of those in pre-industrial England…. Consider… the more equal landownership distribution in Japan relative to Europe…. Mst of the rural population were landless in England but only 16% in Japan circa 1800. Using a Malthusian model, I show landownership equality in Japan paradoxically generated lower wages and GDP per capita… greater equality generating greater population pressures…. If, as many historians believe, high wages in western Europe explain the onset of the Industrial Revolution, then Japan’s failure to industrialize first could have been shaped by its unusual pre-industrial equality…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/45112/1/wp_iast_138.pdf">http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/45112/1/wp_iast_138.pdf</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>But this is really, really not how bosses roll. Can they be taught to?:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Bartleby</strong>: <em>How to Make Hybrid Work a Success</em>: ‘Office time is best spent in a whirlwind of collaborative brainstorming and socialising, home days are logically the time when solo and focused work should get done. That requires bosses to do what comes unnaturally to them, by resisting the temptation to interrupt at will…. Being explicit when a reply is needed on an email saves everyone scurrying around in a desperate bid to answer the boss first…. Burnout is as much of a risk as slacking…. “Managing outputs, not inputs”…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/04/09/how-to-make-hybrid-work-a-success">https://www.economist.com/business/2022/04/09/how-to-make-hybrid-work-a-success</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>All this is from Hubler and Cowan is missing is the “and Jared and Ivanka are still diligently working to save us all!” paragraph:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Steve M.</strong>: <em>We’re Sorting Ourselves Into Two Americas, One of Which (Guess Which One) Is More Troubling</em>: ‘In <em>The New York Times</em>, Shawn Hubler and Jill Cowan tell us that polarization is sorting us into two nations, state by state…. Republicans are doing some seriously partisan things, Hubler and Cowan tell us…. Sounds bad. But Hubler and Cowan assure us that a lot of this is probably theater, so I guess we should all just stop worrying…. And we’re also told that Newsom is being unpleasantly non-centrist: “Conservatives in and outside California have criticized the governor for stoking division.”… Also, California has high housing costs, therefore what Newsom is doing is bad…. [Jon] Michaels, [a] U.C.L.A. professor…. “It’s easy for Governor Newsom to tell struggling Alabamians, ‘I feel your pain,’ but then what? ‘Come rent a studio apartment in San Francisco for $4,000 a month?’” So I guess if you’re a governor and real estate prices surpass a certain level in your state, you’re not allowed to take a position on cultural issues. We end with the mother of a trans child from Dallas who raised $23,000 on GoFundMe to get her kid the hell out of Texas. She recently visited Los Angeles. “The city itself just felt like a safe haven,” Ms. Augustine said. But, she added, her $60,000 salary, which allows her to rent a house in Texas, would scarcely cover a California apartment: “We’re going to have to downsize.”The money aspect of this sucks. But it also sucks that she’s terrified for her kid if she stays in Texas, even in a liberal city. Maybe that should be what’s emphasized here?…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://nomoremister.blogspot.com/2022/04/were-sorting-ourselves-into-two.html">https://nomoremister.blogspot.com/2022/04/were-sorting-ourselves-into-two.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>Very nicely put by the wise and learned Chad Orzel:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Chad Orzel</strong>: <em>All-Purpose College Advice</em>: ‘Education is not a thing that a college or university does to you, it’s a thing that they provide you the resources to do for yourself…. Reading and engaging with books and performances and artwork, grinding through labs and problem sets and exams, interacting with peers and mentors…playing games and putting on shows and volunteering and bullshitting… and all the rest of the vast spectrum of extracurricular activities…. All of those play a role in turning students from the people they were in high school to the people they will be after graduation, and in every one of them, the role of the student is paramount. And in every one of those activities, the institution and its faculty and staff play a support role…. The most critical advice for a college-bound student is just to remember that education is ultimately a thing you do for yourself with resources provided by the institution, and take an active and engaged role in that process…. Choose classes that are interesting and challenging, and do the work…. Seek out opportunities beyond the classroom…. Get out and meet people…. You need to be there, and engaged in the process. Recognize that you’re being given an opportunity, and take advantage of that opportunity in ways that suit your interests and skills. Or help you identify your interests and skills. Or even identify things you don’t want to do…. What we’re selling [at Uiom College] is a high-touch environment where undergraduates and faculty interact much more closely, and that’s its own kind of opportunity. At the same time, though, there are people who would find that high-touch environment very off-putting, who might very well be better served by a different type of institution…. As long as you go in knowing that it’s on you to do that work, you’ll be fine in the end…</p><p>LINK: </p></blockquote><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:51647382,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://chadorzel.substack.com/p/all-purpose-college-advice&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:401191,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Counting Atoms&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bdbc3a84-6569-438b-874b-05ea826cb157_758x758.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;All-Purpose College Advice&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;I’ve spent a bunch of time over the last several days trying to convince high school seniors (and their families) who have been accepted to Union College to come here (and give us significant sums of money).
