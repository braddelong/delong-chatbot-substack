Paragraphs:

Ron Rosenbaum: Revisiting a€oeThe Rise & Fall of the Third Reichd€d a€~William L. Shirer, who 
witnessed a 1934 Nazi rally in Nuremberg, would link the criminality of individuals to communal 
frenzya€!. Why? Why
had Germany, long one of the most ostensibly civilized, highly educated societies on earth, 
transformed itself into an instrument that turned a continent into a charnel house? Why had Germany 
delivered itself over to the
raving exterminationist dictates of one man, the man Shirer refers to disdainfully as a 
a€cevagabonda€D? Why did the world allow a a€oetramp,a€D a Chaplinesque figure whose 1923 beer hall 
putsch was a comic fiasco, to
become a genocidal FA!4hrer whose rule spanned a continent and threatened to last a thousand years? 
Why? William Shirer offered a 1,250-page answer. It wasna€™ t a final answera€! but Shirer reminded 
the world of
a€cewhata€d: what happened to civilization and humanity in those yearsa€!. He was one of a number 
of courageous American reporters who filed copy under the threat of censorship and expulsion, a 
threat that sought to
prevent   them from detailing the worst excesses, including the murder of Hitlera€™ s opponents, 
the beginnings of the Final Solution and the explicit preparations for upcoming war. After war 
broke out, he covered the
savagery                                                                                            
          of the German invasion of Poland and followed the Wehrmacht as it fought its way into 
Paris before he was forced to leave in December 1940a€!. Writing The Rise and Fall was an 
extraordinary act ofa€! literary-
historical generalshipa€”to conquer a veritable continent of informational that terrain of horror 
in a mere 1,250 pagesa€!. Rereading the book, one sees how subtle Shirer is in shifting between 
telescope and microscopea€”
even, one might say, stethoscopea€!. Perhaps one corollary that almost need not be spelled out: 
There is danger in giving up our sense of selfhood for the illusory unity of a frenzied mass 
movement, of devolving from human
to herd for some homicidal abstraction^!

Matthew Yglesias & Dara Lind: Time Machine: Volcker Shock: a€~Voxa€™ s Dylan Matthews joins Matt 
and Dara for another step into Weeds Time Machine: a visit to the past to review some now-forgotten 
chapter in
policy history. This week, ita€™ s a return to the late 1970s and a reexamination of a€oeVolcker 
shocka€D: an attempt by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker to cope with rising inflation, and the myriad 
consequences of his efforts.
Our hosts discuss the oil crisis, stagflation, the curious relationship between central banking and 
fiscal policy, and give some much-needed reanalysis to this crucial and topsy-turvy time in 
American historya€!

Maurice Obstfeld & Kenneth Rogoff (2009): Global Imbalances and the Financial Crisis: Products of 
Common Causes: a€~The global imbalances of the 2000s and the recent global financial crisis are 
intimately
connected. Both have their origins in economic policiesa€! and in distortions that influenced the 
transmission of these policies through U.S. and ultimately through global financial marketsa€!. The 
interaction among the
Feda€™ s monetary stance, global real interest rates, credit market distortions, and financial 
innovation created the toxic mix of conditions making the U.S. the epicenter of the global 
financial crisis. Outside the U.S.,
exchange rate and other economic policies followed by emerging markets such as China contributed to 
the United Statesa€™ ability to borrow cheaply abroad and thereby finance its unsustainable housing 
bubblea€!

Danielle Chiriguayo: How the Trump Administration Chose Politics Over Saving Lives During Pandemic, 
According to White House Insider: a€~Andy Slavitt is President Bidena€™ s former senior advisor on 
COVID, and
the author of a€oePreventable: The Inside Story of How Leadership Failures, Politics, and 
Selfishness Doomed the U.S. Coronavirus Response.a€D He talks to KCRW about the risks the Delta 
variant poses, and how
political leadership factored into Americaa€™ s dismal response to the pandemic. a€oe[The Delta 
variant] really is 2020 CO VID on steroids. Ita€™ s twice as easy to catch,a€D he says. a€oeBut for 
people who are
vaccinateda€! the vaccines are very, very effective, particularly against getting sick. And so 
therea€™ s nothing thata€™ s really shaking my confidence in that.a€Da€! Slavitt says hea€™ s 
relaxed around mask-use, except
when    he has to travela€!. Slavitt says throughout the pandemic, the U.S. was unable to combat 
the virus because communities were divided, especially when peoplea€™ s vulnerability level to 
COVID dictated their lives. He
refers to it as a€oethe room service pandemic.a€Da€! Slavitt says the country suffered because of 
former President Donald Trumpa€™ s dismissive attitudes toward the pandemic. He explains that Trump 
was motivated by
his selfishness and desire to be seen as a winnera€!. When Trump announced he wanted to reopen the 
economy by Easter, Slavitt says he and Jared Kushner worked together to persuade the president to 
push back the datea€!.
a€oeBut sadly, he only delayed until the end of Aprila€! the state authority handoff, which they 
believed would allow them to escape accountability when things inevitably went wrong .a€Da€! 
Slavitt explains that whenever
someone dissented about the handling of the pandemic, the Trump administration fired them or 
silenced them. He shares a moment where former Department of Health and Human Services Secretary 
Alex Azar wanted to add
the phrase a€oebut things might rapidly changea€D to an otherwise positive pandemic report that 
would be shared on a€oeFox & Friends,a€D Slavitt says that when the White House communications team 
learned of the
phrase, he was pulled from the show and they forbade the DHHS from talking to the public for 45 
daysa€!

Marianne Ward & John Devereux: The Road Not Taken: Pre-Revolutionary Cuban Living Standards in 
Comparative Perspective: a€~Cuba was once a prosperous middle-income economy. On the eve of the 
revolution,
incomes were 50 to 60 percent of European levelsa€! among the highest in Latin Americaa€!. In 
relative terms, Cuba was richer earlier on. Income per capita during the 1920s was in striking 
distance of Western Europe and
the Southern United States. After the revolution, Cuba slipped down the world income distribution. 
Current levels of income per capita appear below their pre-revolution levelsa€!

Razib Khan: Here Be Humans: a€~Outside Africa, whether you are an indigenous Australian, Amazonian 
native or a German burgher, fully 90a€“99% of your ancestry derives from a single ancestral human 
population
pulse 60,000 years ago. Somehow, an isolated African tribe of 1,000 to 10,000 people, who became 
genetically homogenous due to their initial small population size, swept across Eurasia. By 50,000 
years ago, they reached
Australia. They had replaced the last Neanderthals and Denisovans by 40,000 years ago, if not 
earlier. They even migrated to North and South America 15,000 years agoa€!
