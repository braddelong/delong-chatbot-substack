First:

I find this from Mervyn King for Bloomberg annoying.

Yes, the risk of inflation is a€cereala€Da€”as it was not in 
2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018, and 2019, in all of which we were assured 
that it was very real indeed. But the risk that the recovery will be anemic is real as well. If 
inflation risks turn out to materialize, the Federal Reserve has a straightforward way of handling 
them. If anemic-recovery risks materialize, there is no path to easily handle them. Given the 
immense
uncertainties, an ability to do the math of option value under asymmetric risks mandates that the 
sensible thing to do is to prioritize rapid recovery now, and to wait until early 2023 to see where 
we are with respect to inflation.

Paragraphs:

A very nice rant about how the absence (so far) of (completely definitive) evidence is not evidence 
of absence, as far as the zoonotic origin of the COVID-19 plague is concerned. Zoonotic origin is 
definitely the way to bet right now, and those who claim otherwise are bad actors, and are not your 
friends:

Josh Rosenau: a€.~Some have wrongly claimed the natural, zoonotic origin of SARS-CoVa€ “2 is now 
less likely because ita€™ s been A WHOLE YEAR and we dona€™ t have the wild ancestor. Today, a 
journal article brings us closer, and shows how hard ita€™ 11 be to get the whole story <https://t 
.co/3iW7mzK2i2>a€!. 411 bat samples collected in Yunnan province, China between 2019a€“2020 yields 
24 full length coronavirus
genomes, including 4 viruses highly related to SARS-CoVa€“2 and 3 to SARSa€!. One virus in the 
sample is now the closest known genetic match to SARS-CoVa€“2a€!. Wuhana€! is surrounded by areas 
with significant predicted horseshoe bat diversitya€!. Finding the exact match will be hard. No 
wonder it took 14 years for SARS-CoVa€“l !a€! Like Ebola and HIV, that intensive field work may not 
turn up the reservoir and
intermediate host(s). Or as with SARS-CoVa€‘T, it could take 14 yearsa€!. I hope Nate Silver, Matt 
Yglesias, Vanity Fair, Wall Street Journala€\ and other outlets that laundered leaks from 
Trumpersa€”repeated their spin that the search cana€™ t pan out and trying to shift blame to 
Chinaa€”will give this research just as much airtime. If the origins of COVID matter, this research 
is far more important than the opinions of: the son of
the a€oefucking stupidest guy on the face of the Earth,a€D emeritus physicists, MAGA breast cancer 
doctors, disgraced racist journalists, or Peter Thiela€™ s manager director.

And, right on time, comes evidence about zoonotic coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2:

Hong Zhou & al.: Identification of Novel Bat Coronaviruses Sheds Light on the Evolutionary Origins 
of SARS-CoVa€ “2 & Related Viruses: a€~Four novel SARS-CoVa€“2 related viruses were identified in 
rhinolophid bats. RpYN06 is the closest relative of SARS-CoVa€“2 in most of the virus genome. A 
high diversity of bat coronaviruses was present in a very small geographic area. Ecological 
modeling reveals a broad range of
rhinolophid bats in parts of Asiaa€!

Journal editors hungry for novelty and positive results have definitely put their thumbs on the 
scale to try to establish that corporate tax cuts boost growth. But they probably do not, at least 
not by very much:

Sebastian Gechert & Philipp Heimberger: Do Corporate Tax Cuts Boost Economic Growth?: a€~The 
empirical literature on the impact of corporate taxes on economic growth reaches ambiguous 
conclusions: corporate tax cuts increase, reduce, or do not significantly affect growth. We apply 
meta-regression methods to a novel dataset with 441 estimates from 42 primary studies. There is 
evidence for publication selectivity in favour of
reporting growth-enhancing effects of corporate tax cuts. Correcting for this bias, we cannot 
reject the hypothesis of a zero effect of corporate taxes on growth. Several factors influence 
reported estimates, including researcher choices concerning the measurement of growth and corporate 
taxes, and controlling for other budgetary componentsa€!

a full daya€™ s labor, as women fetched water from a tap in the courtyard or the street, boiled and 
scrubbed the clothes, exchanged dirty for clean water, and then rinsed and wrung out their 
laundrya€!. It was no surprise, then, that French womena€™ s magazines routinely depicted the 
pleasures of life in the United States, where domestic appliances appeared to have made housework 
obsoletea€!. The image of a home filled with
a€oemechanical servantsa€D was attractive to French women. But having just emerged from years of 
depression and war and now facing a continuing housing shortage and inflation, most French citizens 
found the prices of home appliances beyond their reach. Two postwar changes helped to remedy this 
situation. First, the spread of new spending methodsa€’’notably credita€’’lowered the price of 
appliances and made them available to
more  families. Second, French families came to accept that these items, which had been rare before 
the war, were now indispensablea€!. French women became extremely creative in finding ways to 
acquire the machines, even when the price remained high. For one working-class family movement, the 
solution was washing machine cooperativesa€!

It remains a puzzle why the army and navy on Oahu and in the Philippines were so ill-prepared for 
what went down on December 7, 1941. Isna€™ t this exactly what it was appropriate for the Chief of 
Naval Operations to do? What else should he have done? Agreed, it would have been nice if he had 
said something like a€oean airstrike against Pearl Harbor is a possibilitya€d. But the armament of 
kido butai gave no clues, and its location was unknown, and the
number and equipment of troops and the organization of task forces did suggest an amphibious 
expedition or expeditions to the southa€’’Philippines, Borneo, & c.:

CNO (1941a€“lla€“27): This Dispatch Is to Be Considered a War Warning: a€™ Negotiations with Japan 
looking toward stabilization of conditions in the Pacific have ceased and an aggressive move by 
Japan is expected within the next few days. The number and equipment of Japanese troops and the 
organization of naval task forces indicates an amphibious expedition against either the 
Philippines, Thai or Kra Peninsula or possibly
Borneo. Execute an appropriate defensive deployment preparatory to carrying out the tasks assigned 
in WPL 46. Inform district and Army authorities. A similar warning is being sent by War Department.
