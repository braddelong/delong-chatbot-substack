Konczal says that it is only today that a€ceglib libertariansd€dpurveying d€cefantasiesd€dare 
trying to make us forget a€cethatfree programs and keeping things free from the market are as 
American as apple pied€\d€nOne of the best passages in the book is where he notes the connection 
between the Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign and human freedom: a€ceService sector workers 
demanding a $15 minimum
wage and a uniona€\ have already won huge victories [with] ideas about how low-wage, precarious 
work is a form ofunfreedoma€\. The Rev. William Barber noted that a€~it took 400 years from slavery 
to now to get from zero to $7.25 [an hour]. We cana€™ t wait another 400 yearsa€™ to get to $15a€\ 
Ultimately, if all you can say in response to the ills of society is a€oethe market giveth, the 
market taketh away,
blessed be the name of the marketd€\d€nyou have very little to say indeed. Konczal quotes Oliver 
Wendell Holme sa€™ s fear and alarm that his fellow justices on the Lochner Supreme Court were, in 
their a€cewillingness to use a very specific understanding of economics to override law, writ[ing] 
a preferential understanding of economics into the constitution itselfd€\d€nin a fundamentally 
illegitimate and societally-
disruptive way. But a better maxim is: a€ceThe market was made for man, not man for the marketd€d
