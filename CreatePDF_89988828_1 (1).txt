Summarizing the history of economic growth: At one level, the history of economic growth is 
relatively easy to summarize: Up until 1870, there was essentially none. At least, there was very 
little economic growtha€”if a€oeeconomic growtha€D is taken to be a significant sustained 
improvement in the material living standards of a typical human.
Before 1870, there was technological growth. There was artistic growth. There was intellectual and 
conceptual growth. There was imperial growth. There was organizational growth. There was political 
growtha€’’although that was not necessarily a good thing, if you understand a€cepoliticsa€D to be 
mostly a matter of domination and redistribution.

But there was not, or at least there was very little, economic growth as we would term it. A 
typical human in 1870 had a material standard of living not that much different from that of the 
typical human back in a€“3000, in the age of Gilgamesh of Uruk in Mesopotamia and Narmer of Memphis 
in Egypt. (For the A©lite, by contrast, the life-styles of the rich and famous didget much more 
convenient and luxurious.)

World-transforming boom since 1870: Since 1870, of course, there has been remarkable and fabulous 
economic growth. How much richer is the typical person in the world today than their predecessor 
back in 1870? It is hard to tell. 10 times? 20 times? 30 times? And when we consider that our 
natural resource base is supporting not the 1.3 billion people of 1870 but the  8billion people of 
today, it ishardto see anything less than 20-fold as a lower bound to
the amplification of human powers, to manipulate nature and cooperatively, organize ourselves over 
the past 150 years. That is as much relative technological progress from 1870 to today as we saw 
between the development of agriculture in -6000 and 1870.

• No, we are not using our mammoth, collective, technological powers and wealth to conspicuously 
live wisely and well.

• No, our distribution of our wealth is not just and fair, but rather cruel and malevolent.


•  Yes, even worse than the distribution of wealth, and thus of social power, within nations is the 
distribution of wealth and poverty across the nations.

• Yes, the next fifty years to come will see human civilization facing and perhaps succumbing to 
potentially existential threats.

But that does not keep the economic growth of the past 150 years from being a remarkable 
accomplishment. And that does not diminish the contrast between the posta€“1870 age of economic 
growth, and what came before.

Starting in 1870 it became cleara€”with human technological competence deployed-and-diffused 
worldwide (not just in the southern part of one small island) doubling every generationa€”that 
humanity was on the way to solving the problem of baking a sufficiently large economic pie for 
everyone to potentially have enough. Up until 1870, there had been no possibility of humanity 
baking such a sufficiently large economic pie. Technological progress was
simply too slow. Human fecunditya€”and the desire to have surviving children, especially sonsa€”was 
just too great. Afterward those things were no longer true. And that changed everything.

I thus stake the claim that 1870 is the hinge of history. And I ask you to grant that claim. This 
course will presume that that claim is true.

The lack of a€oeeconomic growtha€D before 1870: What comes next here is a first obvious question: 
What kept there from being a€oeeconomic growtha€D before 1870?

My tentative answer is that, back before 1870, the world economy was under Malthusian pressure that 
kept humanity desperately poor. Technological progress was slow: on the order of 5% per century 
before 1500, and higher thereafter, but not sufficiently higher thereafter to make a big 
difference. That meant, before 1500, that a 10% percent per century rate of growth in the human 
population would reinforce resource scarcity enough to offset the benefits that
better technology would otherwise have yielded in higher material living standards.

Such 10% per century increases in human population were almost inescapable.

Why was sufficient population growth to offset the slow progress of technology, in terms of its 
effect on typical living standards, near-inevitable back then?
That was itself an indirect consequence of the slowness prea€“1870 of technological advance.

People really like to make love. People really, really like to make love. Patriarchy prioritizes 
surviving sons. In the dire poverty of pre-modern patriarchal societies, it is nearly social death 
for womena€”and, substantially, for mena€”to reach late middle-age with no surviving sons. Reflect 
that under conditions of slow technological development, and thus slow population growth, one-third 
of humans will wind up without surviving sons.
Hence, whenever there were extra resources to support raising more children, people were under 
enormous pressure to use them to do so. This was Thomas Robert Malthusa€™ s key insight: population 
expands until it reaches the limits of subsistence. Slow technological progress means that that 
a€oeuntila€n arrives in, at most, a few generations.

The only potentially bright spot in the picture is that a€oesubsistencea€D is as much a 
sociological as a biomedical and nutritional concept. Malthus strongly believed that the right 
sociological institutions were patriarchy, monarchy, and orthodoxy. Patriarchy was to delay, the 
age of female marriage, and so reduce female, fertility without requiring women to be so skinny 
that ovulation was hit or miss. Monarchy was to reinforce patriarchy, as the king as father
of the country figured the father as king of the household. Orthodoxy to threaten women who engaged 
in premarital sex with hell.

This dire poverty meant that pre-modern politics and governance were a poisonous weed. In a world 
in which there cannot be enough for all, at the foundation politics and governance can be little 
more than an A©lite elbowing competitors out of the way, and running a force-and-fraud exploitation 
game on the rest of humanity.

This A©lite of thugs-with-spears (and later thugs-with-gunpowder-weapons), along with their tame 
accountants, bureaucrats, and propagandists^’’they could have enough. And with their enough they 
could build and enjoy their high culture. But those who controlled the commons, and had enough so 
that they could have the leisure to write the literatures that have come down to usa€”those were 
hard men, who reaped where they did not sow, and gathered
where they did not scatter. They made typical human life fairly dystopian back in the long Agrarian 
age, even after taking account of the general poverty.

But why was technological progress slow back then?

A good deal of the answer is that they simply were not enough people and not enough sufficiently 
educated people to have the energy and time to think about solving the problems of advancing 
technology. Two heads are not twice as good as one, quite. But two heads are considerably better 
than one. And heads that are not exhausted by the combination of hard work and a scant diet have 
more energy to think, plan, experiment, and evaluate.
Plus we humans are much smarter when we think together. Thinking together requires that we be able 
to communicate not just within our own little band or village, but communicate across space and 
across time. To the extent that humanity is more numerous, richer, better educated, and better able 
to communicate across space and time, we can become a truly remarkably intelligent anthology 
intelligence.

In the years since 1870, that ability to transform ourselves into such an anthology intelligence 
has allowed us to power technological progress forward at 2% per year on average, even though the 
low-hanging technological fruit has long been harvested, and even though a great deal of the 
technological fruit we are now harvesting is a very, very high indeed.

But there is more than a lack of numbers, lack of education, lack of energy and leisure, and lack 
of the means of communication and memory behind the slow rate of technological progress back before 
modern economic growth. In a society where the typical activity of those who deploy resources is to 
use them to grab enough for themselves from everybody else, the ideas that will be promoted will 
not be ideas that are true, but rather ideas that are useful for that
grabbing process. The consequences of general poverty for inequality, and the consequences of 
inequality for ideas and for the direction of societal effort are major drags on even the 
possibility of technological development.

Five questions about economic growth: But why there was so little economic growth before 1870 is 
just the first obvious question about the history of economic growth.
I find, adding them up, that I have five obvious questionsa€”or maybe six:

1. What we just covereda€”what kept there from being a€oeeconomic growtha€D before 1870? How and 
why was there was no alternative, earlier, hinge? How was it that the Devil of Malthus had so 
ensorcelled humanity before 1870? How was it that its spell had been so powerful from a€“6000 to 
1870?

2. How did pre-modern societies without a€oeeconomic growtha€D work? How did they function and 
operate as modes-of-production, -distribution, -domination, -communication, and -innovation?

3. How did the great phase-transition of 1870 happen? Given the prea€“1870 power of humanitya€™ s 
ensorcellment by the Devil of Malthus, how could we then wreak the miracle of breaking it?

4. How did economic growth then develop and evolve after 1870?

5. What were the consequences of the great posta€“1870 rocket of economic growth?

Consequences of the 1870 hinge of history: The fifth question: What were the consequences for 
humanity and society of the fact that as of 1870 we managed to harness the rocket of economic 
growth of 2% per year average technological progress?

My big book of 2022, Slouching Towards Utopia: The Economic History of the 20th Century 
<bit.ly/3pP3Krk>, gives my answer to (5). (It also offers a little bit of thought about (4), and 
takes the briefest glance at (3)). Here is my answer to the a€ceconsequencesa€D question:

After 1870 it rapidly became clear that things could be very different: a€oeEconomic Eldoradoa€D, 
as John Maynard Keynes put it, was on the way.

In 1870 the last pieces of the institutional complex that supported what Simon Kuznets labelled 
a€oeModern Economic Growtha€Da€’’average real income and productivity levels doubling every 
generation, growing at an average rate of 2%/year or morea€”fell into place. The addition to the 
institutions that were there before pushed humanity across a watershed boundary with the coming of

• the industrial research lab,

• the modern corporation, and

• the globalized market economy

These revolutionized the discovery, development, deployment, and diffusion of human technologies 
useful for manipulating nature and cooperatively organizing ourselves. There was as much global 
technological advance from 1870 to 2010 as there had been from a€“6000 to 1870. Humanitya€™ s 
deployed-and-diffused technological prowess in 2023 stood at a level at least 20 times its level as 
of 1870. And although there was a population explosiona€”
humanitya€™ s numbers rose from about 1.3 billion in 1870 to 8 billion in 2022a€”that explosion 
soon ebbed with the coming of the demographic transitiona€”the rise of feminism, the coming of 
better nutrition, the lowering of infant mortality, and the consequent shift from high to low 
fertility. Before 1870 humanitya€™ s ingenuity in technological discovery had lost its race with 
human fecundity. Afterward it decisively won it.

And yet, while things were different after 1870, they were not different enough. Finding the 
solution to that problem of baking a sufficiently large economic pie did not get us very far, 
because the problems of slicing and tasting the piea€”of equitably distributing it, and of 
utilizing our wealth so humans could live, lives in which they felt safe and secure, and were 
healthy and happya€’’continued to completely flummox us. As I said above:

• We are not using our mammoth, collective, technological powers and wealth to conspicuously live 
wisely and well.

• Our distribution of our wealth is not just and fair but rather cruel and malevolent.

• Even worse than distribution within the nations is distribution across the nations.

• Plus: the next fifty years to come will see human civilization facing and perhaps succumbing to 
potentially existential threats.

That we have succeeded remarkably over the past 150 years in baking, a sufficiently large economic 
pie for everybody, potentially, to have enough; and yet the problems of slicing and tasting the 
piea€”of equitably distributing it and using it to live wisely and well, so that people feel safe 
and secure and are healthy and happya€’’continue to flummox us. These are facts.
And these facts surprise me.

Since 1870 industrial research labs, modern corporations, globalization, and the market 
economya€’’which, as that genius Friedrich von Hayek most keen-sightedly observed, is, when 
properly tuned, tremendously effective at crowdsourcing solutions to the societal problems humanity 
sets ita€”proved keys to the lock that had kept humanity in its desperately poor iron cage. 
Previously unimaginable economic growth revolutionized human life over and over,
generation by generation. We should, thereafter, have straightforwardly turned our technological 
power and wealth to building something very close to a utopia: a truly human world. Few in 1870 
would have doubted that a humanity today more than ten times richer in material terms than it had 
been would succeed in building a near utopia.

So what went wrong? Well, that idiot Friedrich von Hayek thought the unleashed market would do the 
whole job: a€oethe market giveth, the market taketh away: blessed be the name of the marketa€D. 
But, as that genius Karl Polanyi put it: people will not stand for being told that there are no 
rights but property rights. They instead insist that a€oethe market was made for man, not man for 
the marketa€D. The marketa€™ s treating those whom society saw as
equals unequally, or unequals equally, brought social explosion after explosion, blocking the road 
to utopia. They deserved communities, incomes, and stability. They needed their Polanyian rights to 
those things vindicated too.


Since 1870 humansa€’’Theodore Roosevelt, John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt, Vladimir Lenin, Margaret Thatcher, Deng Xiaoping, and othersa€” tried to think up 
solutions. They dissented from a€oethe market givetha€!a€D constructively and destructively. The 
demanded that the market do less, or different, and other institutions do more. Only with the 
social-democratic shotgun marriage of von Hayeka€™ s
a€oemarketa€n to Polanyia€™ s a€cesocietya€d, a marriage blessed by Keynesa€”a marriage that itself 
has so far failed its own sustainability testsa€”have we been able to even slouch towards utopia, 
and bring the El Dorado of a truly human world into view. Yet the social-democratic order of the 
post-WWII generation failed its own sustainability test, and was replaced by the neoliberal order, 
which now nobody likes. And so the problems of equitable
distribution and wise utilization continue to flummox us.

Much, after all, of what made us so bad at slicing and tastinga€”at equitably distributing and then 
wisely and well utilizing our wealtha€”back before Modern Economic Growth was precisely the focus 
on the A©lite on its domination-and-exploitation machine through which it grabbed enough for its 
members. Government of men, Friedrich Engels wrote in the 1880s, was about some exploiting others. 
But with the coming of general abundance via the
productivity of high technology, and with the detailed division of labor within each factory and 
enterprise making it so obvious that our productivity was not our individual doing but rather the 
joint product of our cooperative division of labor, the need and desire to exploit and dominate 
would fade away. a€oeThe government of men would be replaced by the mere administration of 
thingsa€D. And a€oethe statea€Da€”that human-constructed Moloch that ran
the exploitation-and-domination machinea€”a€oewould not be abolished, but rather would wither 
awaya€D.

It did not happen.

How Malthusian economies and societies worked: How about the other questions?

I have not yet written my book(s) about them. Economic historian Eric Jones has a line:

Oscar Wilde expected to be met at the Pearly Gates by St Peter bearing an armful of sumptuously 
bound volumes and declaring, a€oeMr Wilde, these are your unwritten worksa€Da€!

I find myself almost unmanned at the thought of the task of trying to write them.

Let me sketch out my tentative answer to (2): How did pre-modern societies without a€oeeconomic 
growtha€D work? How did they function and operate as modes-of-production, -distribution, 
-domination, -communication, and -innovation?

The dominant features are (1) change was very slow, and (2) most people were engaged in 
near-subsistence farming, pastoralism, or simple craftwork in which people produced just enough 
food and goods or things to trade for food and goods to meet their basic needs, after taxes. And 
after bandits.

The division of labor was not very sophisticated. The mode of distribution was mainly through 
bartering or the exchange of goods within a community. There was little to no market economy, and 
people would exchange goods based on need or mutual benefita€”not so much supply and demand, but 
rather on social status and community needs.

The mode of domination was through a ruling class, often a rigid hierarchical one, that controlled 
the land and resources, and a lower class that worked the land and resourcesa€”that was how the 
A©lite managed its force-and-fraud extraction-and-domination game. Taxes, forced labor, tribute, 
theft, enslavement, or other forms of domination and extraction. Literacy was low. The mode of 
communication was mainly through oral tradition and storytelling.
Innovation was slowa€”small-scale improvements in agricultural and craft techniques. There was 
little incentive for innovation. However, people did make small improvements to their agricultural 
techniques, such as developing new tools or methods of irrigation, in order to increase their 
productivity and improve their livelihoods.

However, pre-modern societies were not necessarily stagnant or unchanging. There were 
a€ceefflorescencesa€D: golden ages. There were civilizational collapses, followed by dark ages. 
There were ebbs and flows in inequality. There were substantial fluctuations upward and downward, 
in population density, in the average level of production per capita, and in the living standards 
of both the A©lite and the commons. There was a slow upward drift in average
population, as technology creeped forward, but then, as the potential benefits for living standards 
of better technology were neutralized by population growth, and hence greater resource scarcity. 
There never was any breakthrough to any level of technological progress that held any chance of 
kicking the society out of its Malthusian equilibrium.

The great breakthrough of 1870: Let me sketch out my tentative answer to (3): How did the great 
phase-transition of 1870 happen?

It is actually a huge bunch of interrelated questions: Given the prea€“1870 power of humanitya€™ s 
ensorcellment by the Devil of Malthus, how could we then wreak the miracle of breaking it? Why did 
no one think to gather communities of engineering practice to supercharge economic growth before 
1870? How exactly did the research lab and the corporation in the context of the global market 
economy empower us to accomplish these tremendous feats?
Was the explosion of wealth and productivity of 1870 causally-thin, in the sense that institutions 
had to evolve then in a way that was unlikely to get the explosion? Or was this growth acceleration 
of the Second industrial Revolution, what Northwestern economist Robert Gordon caals a€oeone big 
wave oa€D, causally-thicka€’’largely baked in the cake, while the causally-thin nexus or nexuses 
came earlier? These are very hard and deep questions indeed.

The key, as I see it, is what is called the Second Industrial Revolution, was a period of rapid 
technological and economic growth that occurred in the late 19th centurya€”the development of new 
technologies such as the steam turbine, the internal combustion engine, and the Bessemer process 
for mass-producing steel, which led to a significant increase in productivity and industrial 
output. It was not so much any one single invention, as that invention after
invention came and kept coming in very rapid succession, pushing the rate of technology growth 
worldwide up to 2.1% per year, more than four times as fast as the 0.45% per year rate of 
technology growth seen during the 1770 to 1870 British Industrial Revolution century, which in its 
turn was three times as fast as the 0.15% per year rate of global technology growth in the 
1500a€“1770 Imperial-Commercial Revolution age, which was in its turn triple the
roughly 0.05% per year rate of growth of the prea€“1500 Agrarian age.

The 0.45% per year rate of technology growth seen during the 1770 to 1870 British Industrial 
Revolution century was not enough to break humanitya€™ s ensorcellment by the Devil of Malthus. 
Looking back on 1770a€“1870, John Stuart Mill saw the same-old same-old: a much greater population, 
yes, but the bulk of humanitya€’’the working classa€”living the same life of a€oedrudgery and 
imprisonmenta€D.

A great host of very important institutional changes and developments well before 1870 had set the 
stage for the breakthrough. In 1870, however, three more institutions arrived: the industrial 
research lab, the modern corporation, and the fully globalized market economy. With those falling 
into place, it was possible to gather together gather communities of engineering practice to 
supercharge economic growth. The shift from manual labor to machine-based
labor. The rise not just of the factory system but the value chain. The build-out of the railway 
and the steamship network. Urbanization. The mechanization of mining, especially of iron ore and 
coal. And then the coming of oil drilling.

All of these institutions fell into place between 1500 and 1870 in what I have decided to call the 
a€oeDover Circle Plusa€Da€”the 300-mile circle centered on the port of Dover in the very southeast 
corner of the island of Great Britain, plus its settler-colony offshoots in Ontario, and the U.S. 
northeast and midwest. How they fell into place is a very complicated and still unsettled story. 
How these institutions and the wealth that accompanied them then diffused,
partially, unevenly, and slowly to the rest of the globe is a different very complicated and still 
unsettled story.

How the process of repeated economic revolution after 1870 worked: Let me sketch out my tentative 
answer to (4): How did economic growth then develop and evolve after 1870? I find myself looking 
forward from 1870 later in time to trace how the research lab-, corporation-, and global market 
economy-enabled discovery, development, deployment, and diffusion of technologies at an 
unprecedented, revolutionary, Schumpeterian creative-destruction, pace
worked itself out, leading sector by leading sector and trailing sector by trailing sector. One of 
the key drivers of economic growth after 1870 was the continued development and deployment of new 
technologies, such as the internal combustion engine, the telephone, and the electric motor. These 
pushed forward new industries and sectors: automobiles, telecommunications, electricity, and many 
many more. The research lab provided the necessary infrastructure
for the development of new technologies, while the corporation provided the funding and 
organizational structure for the implementation of these technologies on a large scale. And the 
global market economy incentivized their development and deployment and facilitated their 
diffusion.

The growth of international trade and commerce led to the rise of new economic powers, such as the 
United States and Germany, and the decline of traditional economic powers such as Great Britain. 
The increased competition in the global market economy also led to the rise of new forms of 
business organization such as the multinational corporation. One of the key characteristics was the 
process of creative destruction, as described by economist Joseph
Schumpetera€”constant change and innovation, which was a key driver of economic growth during this 
period. Not at all a linear process.

Economic growth reality and ideas: Let me add another set of concerns to the mix: We need to always 
remember that humans do not just do, they think about what they are doing. We must cover not only 
what the economy in the process of economic growth or non-growth was, but also what people thought 
they were doinga€”and what they thought their options and possibilities were. Economic growth is 
not just about the numbers and statistics, but also about
the human experience and the way people perceived and understood the economic changes that were 
taking place. For many, the rise of the factory system and the increased use of machines led to new 
forms of employment and the possibility of upward mobility. However, it also led to the rise of new 
social and economic classes, new forms of social unrest, and the rise of new political movements. 
Peoplea€™ s perceptions of their options and possibilities were
also transformed, as colonial empires and the development of the global market economy led to new 
forms of economic and political power, but also added new modes of exploitation and new drivers of 
economic inequality.

Quantitative guesses: Throughout this course, I will structure what we do around this table of my 
guesses as to the shape of the human economya€”how many people P, roughly what their average real 
income in today's dollars happens to be y, and then this measure of mine H, which is average real 
income y times the square root of population P. I will assert that H is a rough measure of 
"technology": our capability to manipulate nature and productively
organize ourselves, as created by the human ideas about how to do things that have been discovered, 
developed, and deployed, and that then have diffused throughout the human economy. Population, 
average real income, and human ideas P,y, and H have their proportional annual growth rates n, g, 
and h, respectively:
