Why has the last century has left much of us vastly richer yet still profoundly dissatisfied.

Before 1870, most people lived in dire poverty, the benefits of the slow crawl of invention 
continually offset by a growing population. Then came a great shift: invention sprinted forward, 
doubling our technological
capabilities each generation, and creatively destroying the economy again and again. Brad DeLonga€™ 
s Slouching Towards Utopia: An Economic History of the Twentieth Century <bit.ly/3pP3Krk> tells the 
story of the
major economic and technological shifts of the 20th century.

DeLong charts the unprecedented explosion of material wealth after 1870 which transformed living 
standards around the world, freeing humanity from centuries of poverty, but paradoxically has left 
us now with
unprecedented inequality, global warming and widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo. Our 
ancestors believed that by now utopia would have been the inevitable result of such material 
wellbeing a€“ instead of arriving
at   utopia we are slouching towards it.

In this conversation with Bristol Ideasa€™ Andrew Kelly, DeLong looks at the role of public 
understanding of the complexity of economics; writing grand narratives and the inspiration of Eric 
Hobsbawm; and the
importance of editors. They discuss economic growth from 1870 in the great transformation; Mill, 
Keynes, von Hayek and Karl Polanyi; the great period of social democracy and welfare in the 
a€~Trente Glorieusesa€™
post-Second World War; the collapse of the New Deal Order and how it might have been saved; the 
impact of neoliberalism; and the challenges now and what to do next.
