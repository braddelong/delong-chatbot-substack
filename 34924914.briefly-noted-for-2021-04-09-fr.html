So I am making the circuit of SubStack Pro. Today's stop is Freddie deBoer:</p><p>My knee-jerk reaction is: WHOA!! This goes totally off the rails, starting with "apparently so is something called Rebecca Baird-Remba…" </p><p>If Freddie deBoer wanted to make me 100% certain that SBR is right when she says—of FdB—“I.. was like... 'do we need this in the world again?’”, he would have to call her a inhuman “it”. And that is what he went and did. </p><p>No: we do not need this in the world again. It has long been a grave and pointed insult in English to call a man a woman, or to call a woman a prostitute. Calling a woman an inhuman thing does not seem to be an improvement.</p><p>Hamish, Chris: Is this your more thoughtful platform in action?</p><p>After that the spiral downward continues. </p><p>I wonder. I think: FdB wants me to read him, to listen to him, to understand him and consider his arguments. And yet here he is, giving me an overwhelming desire to simply get up and quietly sidle away to where the conversation and more information-rich and less… simply unbalanced:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Freddie deBoer</strong>: <em>There You Go Again</em>: ‘She’s in the club, so it’s OK. She’s in the digital media kaffee klatsch. (Apparently so is something called Rebecca Baird-Remba; I don’t know, I don’t read <em>Commercial Observer</em>.) She’s done the necessary ingratiating… liked the shitty joke tweets… pretended to care… gritted her teeth and congratulated writers she really, really didn’t like about their new jobs. She has completed the rituals, the sorority rush… awarded a rung on the ladder. That’s why she’s allowed to do it, and I’m not…. </p><p>These people… their endlessly workshopped dry one-liners… depressed and anxious… cries for help of desperate people, trapped in a dying industry, making pennies to grind out something called content while 70 year olds in the same business write 5000 words a year and watch their pensions grow. They think that they’re participating in the traditions of Joan Didion and Ellie Bly but the work they produce are listicles about Tik Tok and thinkpieces about Rick &amp; Morty.… They mock Silicon Valley while quietly knowing that they are utterly in its thrall, that any shithead VC baron could come along at any moment, decide to throw a switch, and obliterate them and their publication.... They look at publications like the <em>New Yorker</em> as the cathedrals they aspire to work for, not seeming to realize that the beauty of being a cathedral is you get to treat even your big name employees like shit.... They want some security but they won’t take that job offer from their uncle because they’re sure, somehow, that they’re better than him…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/freddie-nitro-edition-there-you-go">https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/freddie-nitro-edition-there-you-go</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p>My considered reaction: This is someone who should not tweet. This is someone who should not blog. This is someone who very much needs an editor—and a good editor who cares for him, and will calmly, patiently explain to him just how his current presentation-of-self shtick is alienating his potential core audience, and leading them all to think “is there any reason we need this?”</p><p>I think it was cruel for SubStack to have given him the keys—the social power and resources, via SubStack Pro—to do this full time without giving him an editor who cares.</p><p>Hamish, Chris, &amp; company: What do you think you are doing here?</p><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Janelle Shane</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Being Vaccinated Does Not Mean It’s Okay to Ask Gpt–3 to Participate in Meme Formats About Pandemics That Didn’t Exist When Its Internet Training Data Cut Off in Oct 2019</em>: ‘Being vaccinated does NOT mean you can travel through time and multiple realities.

The fact that Tankersley thinks the same gives me much more confidence in my take:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Jim Tankersley</strong>:&nbsp;<em>With Warning to Democrats, Manchin Points the Way for Biden’s Agenda</em>: ‘The West Virginia Democrat’s latest plea for bipartisanship suggested that, to win over a critical swing vote in his own party, President Biden will first have to reach out to Republicans…. The chances that such a compromise will materialize are slim…. Manchin’s calls for bipartisanship were less an insurmountable obstacle for Democrats than a road map for Mr. Biden… reaching out to Republicans to explore possible areas of compromise while laying the groundwork to steer around them if no such deal materializes…. Biden… aim[s] at increasing the pressure on Republicans to compromise—and, if they will not, giving Mr. Manchin and other moderate Democrats whose backing Mr. Biden needs the political cover to accept an all-Democratic plan…. [Biden] urged Republicans to “listen to your constituents,” arguing that voters across America back infrastructure spending on the scale Mr. Biden envisions…. Smaller pieces that could attract 10 or more Republican votes each, starting with a bill focused on supply chains and competition with China…. Postponing Mr. Biden’s proposed tax increases on corporations… if doing so would get Republicans on board with a spending bill…. Manchin… has blared his message: First, try bipartisanship. “Senate Democrats must avoid the temptation to abandon our Republican colleagues on important national issues,” Mr. Manchin wrote in the Washington Post op-ed on Thursday. “Republicans, however, have a responsibility to stop saying no, and participate in finding real compromise”… </p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/business/biden-manchin-infrastructure.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/business/biden-manchin-infrastructure.html</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>3) The only reporters who should speak at White House press briefings should be local reporters not in Washington, D.C. who have substantive policy-related questions. Just saying:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Anne Laurie</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Media Mudlarks Open Thread: We’re&nbsp;Dying&nbsp;Over Here, Dude!</em>: ‘From the ‘Short Attention Span’ file, by an experienced Washington Post reporter: Dana Houle: “Nope.

And, ok, they have their weird little conventions about “off the record” and “background” so they can’t always share the specifics of what they know, but the top political people get on teevee all the time and do “ANALYSIS” and it is here that they basically just lie.

As the North grew stronger… northern politicians… advocate[d] federal policies designed to bring about the “ultimate extinction” of southern slavery… the overthrow of a powerful slaveholding class and the destruction of the largest, wealthiest slave system in the world. Antislavery politicians could safely do this because their own economy was not threatened by the destruction of slavery. Northerners wanted cotton, but… grown by free laborers….</p><p>The slaveholders could not respond in kind. Proslavery politicians may have convinced themselves that grass would grow on the streets of New York and Philadelphia if the North dared make war on King Cotton, but the North had no intention of making war on cotton. It made war on slavery…. For all the proslavery bluster, the Old South never produced a popular movement calling for the abolition of free labor. Here and there eccentric intellectuals predicted the imminent demise of “free society,” but not even the most bellicose… advocated… the “ultimate extinction” of capitalism. They couldn’t…. Southern leaders struggled to insulate slavery from the revolutionary threat of capitalism….

Possibly when valued in gold, certainly not when valued in salt.

Europe was awash in rumors of Timbuktu’s seemingly endless wealth and resources. It’s said that, in 1324, Mali’s sultan, Mansa Moussa, made a pilgrimage to Mecca with 60,000 slaves and servants and so much gold that, during his visit to Cairo, the price of the precious metal dropped precipitously…. Ibn Battuta visited the famed city 30 years later, and his descriptions of the bustling metropolis stoked the… imagination….

Hundreds of scholars studied at the nearly 200 maktabs (Quranic schools). These scholars worked as scribes, thus increasing the number of manuscripts in the city. (You can browse through digital versions of some of the manuscripts here.) Visiting strangers were treated like royalty in hopes that they’d share their knowledge and books with Timbuktu’s scholars. As California State University’s Brent Singleton, wrote: “the acquisition of books is mentioned more often than any other display of wealth, including the building and refurbishment of mosques” in texts from the era. Timbuktu was one of the world’s great centers of learning.
