So, how are students using AI?</em>: ‘Since I introduced AI to my class a couple of weeks ago, my students have described dozens of uses that I never expected. I thought I would list of few of them…. <strong>Making new things…. </strong>By the end of the class one of my students, Kirill Naumov, had created a working demo for his entrepreneurship project - a <a href="https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1600251548075888640?s=20&amp;t=9zRkOmU2OHms0DgsgmqC-A">program that would automatically detect a face and play a video clip</a> - using a code library he had never used before, in less than half the time it would otherwise have taken. <a href="https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/">AI is very, very good at helping people code</a>. <strong>Explaining concepts…. Correcting errors: </strong>Students mentioned feeding problems they got incorrect on tests or problem sets to the AI to better understand what they were doing wrong. They then asked for a corrections and explanations…. <strong>As a model to overcome inertia &amp; uncertainty…. As a source of inspiration…. As a summary tool: </strong>ChatGPT is remarkably good at summarizing large blocks of academic text, material from user interviews, transcripts from meetings, and so on…. The lessons of user innovation is that technology is only really useful when it is used…. Thanks to ChatGPT, practical AI is available to everyone. To understand why that may matter, think about a much less capable system - Excel. As anyone in an organization knows, Excel is already the ad hoc programming language of the office workers, because few of them know Python, but many of them understand Excel…. With easy-to-use AI, everyone will be applying it to the problems they want to solve. It won’t work in every case, but it will in many cases. And the impacts are likely to be unexpected and widespread….

It’s a bit of a legislative Christmas tree, as you’d expect from something that ends up with 88 votes in the Senate, but <a href="https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/12/what-they-are-saying-the-water-resources-development-act-of-2022">all the major environmental groups</a> are endorsing it…. The things Congress authorizes in these big bills tend not to end up fully funded when the annual appropriations cycle comes around. So excitement around a big comprehensive bill inevitably has an element of overstatement…. The point, though, is that the Water Resources Development Act does a bunch of useful things. It also reflects, I think, most people’s broad sense of how politics “ought to” work — it addresses a bunch of topics that earnest progressive activists have put on the radar, but in a non-radical, business-friendly way it emphasizes bipartisanship and problem-solving rather than revolution. Some horses were traded, some deals were struck, the ball is moved forward…. The larger bipartisan NDAA [was not] the major story…. The major story is always some form of ugly fighting, and because Congress wasn’t doing much ugly fighting, the main story instead became Elon Musk…. One of my theses (developed with Simon Bazelon) has been that this is not a coincidence — it<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-rise-and-importance-of-secret">’s easier for Congress to get things done when it’s quiet</a>, but having most of the good parts of politics languish in obscurity feeds cynicism, just as few people know the underlying story of improving water…</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Edward Luce: </strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/068faf68-55b7-4a5c-a144-12503fe34e02">The meaning of Ron DeSantis</a>: <em>Trump’s most serious rival is key to the future of Trumpism</em>: ‘An enduring debate about Donald Trump is whether he stands for a clear ideology or just for Donald Trump. The latter was never in doubt. But it has taken Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor and the former US president’s chief rival, to fashion a worldview from Trump’s gut instincts…. It is Trump’s likeliest nemesis, other than himself, who is doing the most to build Trumpism into a lasting force…. Many of the right’s biggest donors, including Peter Thiel, the Koch family and Ken Griffin, are backing DeSantis. Those who hope the Republican party will revert to its pre-Trump character after he has gone are missing the plot. In some ways, DeSantis is even further removed than Trump from the party of Ronald Reagan….. You might describe DeSantis’s philosophy as fossil fuel Christian nationalism. Its enemies are amoral tech oligarchs, Big Pharma, ESG-endorsing finance, the corporate media and elite universities. Since Trump does exist, we call it Trumpism. The difference lies in the competence of its execution…</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 50% off a group subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?group=true&amp;coupon=d518ad48"><span>Get 50% off a group subscription</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Donate Subscriptions&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;donate=true"><span>Donate Subscriptions</span></a></p><div class="install-substack-app-embed"><img class="install-substack-app-embed-img"><div class="install-substack-app-embed-text"><div class="install-substack-app-header">Read null in the Substack app</div><div class="install-substack-app-text">Available for iOS and Android</div></div><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_context=author-post-insert" target="_blank" class="install-substack-app-embed-link"><button class="install-substack-app-embed-btn button primary">Get the app</button></a></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2022-12-22-th/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2022-12-22-th/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>
