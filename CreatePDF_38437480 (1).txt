There has been some interest in this over on twitter and elsewhere. So time to highlight it once 
more. From 2008.1 think it stands up very well:

Alma Mater Blogginga€\: Greg Mankiwa€™ s desire to move Harvard to someplace better adapted to 
human life than Massachusetts was triggered by:

Greg Mankiwa€™ s Blog: Time for Harvard to Move?: The Wall Street Journal reports one of the most 
pernicious ideas I have heard of late: a€oeMassachusetts legislators, demonstrating a growing 
resentment against the wealth of elite universities in tight economic times, are studying a plan to 
levy a 2.5% annual tax on the portion of college endowments that exceed $1 billion. The effort 
takes aim at one of the primary economic
engines of the state, which is home to nine universities with endowments that surpass the $1 
billion level, led by Harvard Universitya€™ s $35 billion cache, the nationa€™ s largesta€!. 
Supporters said the proposal would raise $1.4 billion a year. Based on the most recent size of 
Harvarda€™ s endowment, the university would have to shell out more than $840 million annuallya€!

There is an important underlying issue here with respect to Americaa€™ s private universitiesa€!

Let me put it this way: in 1960, the University of Californiaa€“then overwhelmingly UCB and UCSF 
and UCLAa€“was about four times the size of Harvard, 5000 vs. 1200 undergraduates a year, with 
graduate students and faculty roughly in proportion. Clark Kerr, as president of the University of 
California in the 1960s, took a look at space constraints in Berkeley and Westwood, took a look at 
the rising population of California, took a look at increasing
wealth, took a look at increasing educational attainment, took a look at the increasing 
attractiveness of American universities to people abroad, and conclude that the number of 
undergraduate students who could and would want to take full advantage of a UC education was going 
to grow eightfold over the next fifty years. So he decided to go all-out to clone UCB and UCLA.

And he did it.

Today we have UC Davis, UC Merced, UC Santa Barbara, UC Santa Cruz, UC Sunnydale, UC Irvine, UC 
Riverside, UC San Diego which together with UCB and UCLA graduate 40,000 undergraduates a year. 
Quality of education at UCB and UCLA has suffered a little bit as this cloning process has diverted 
resources away from usa€“but only by a very little bit. And the other UCs are damned gooda€“with 
Davis and UCSD now being, I think, equal to the

Davis and UCSD now being, I think, equal to the
flagship campuses (although we dona€™ t admit it in bureaucratic system wars). And the Cal States 
do an impressive job as well. And the community colleges provide remarkable educational value for 
the money. The high administrators of the University of California starting with Clark Kerr have an 
extraordinary, remarkable accomplishment to look back upon. And they should be very prouda€ 
“especially as they have accomplished it in the face of declining
relative levels of support from the state legislature in Sacramento.

Harvard, over the same fifty-year time spana€!

Harvard has gone from 1200 undergraduates a year to 1600, and has done so in spite of starting with 
a substantial endowment and receiving $15B of private charitable gifts. Harvard does a great many 
things wella€“and I am impressed by the fact that Larry SummersaC™ s presidency seems to have had 
the effect of creating a large brand-new science building on every block. But it is hard to think 
that the production function from resources to outcomes is an
efficient one or something to be particularly proud of: I think presidents Pusey, Bok, Rudenstine, 
Summers, and Bok again were beaten by the system. At meetings of high academic administrators 
Berkeley Chancellor Robert Birgeneau and his ilk can hold their heads up high as proud successors 
to a highly capable group of administrators who made a lot of lemonade out of the lemons that they 
were handed, but I dona€™ t think Harvard president Faust can do
the same.

Somebody last weeka€“was it Jan de Vries? John Ellwood? Somebody else? I forget who, but it is not 
original to mea€“said that the right model for Harvard over the past century is Yugoslavia. 
Remember the story of the Yugoslavian socialist worker-managed firm? If you add another worker to 
the firm, that worker gets a pro-rata share of the firma€™ s value added. The firma€™ svalue added 
has a component attributable tothe firma€™ s capital stock, a
component attributable to the ideas embedded in the firm, a component attributable to the firma€™ s 
market position, and a component attributable to the workers. Hire another worker, and only the 
last of these goes up: the first three do not, and so average compensation falls.

This means that a worker-managed firm is likely to shrink whenever it gets good news that makes it 
more product!vea€“the larger is the value added due to ideas, capital, or market position, the more 
expensive does it become for the existing workers to replace workers who leave, let alone hire 
enough workers to expand. While a competitive market capitalist firm responds to good news about 
its productivity and value tosociety byincreasing employment, a
Yugoslavian-model market socialist firm responds to good news about its productivity and value to 
society by shrinking. On this analysis, the very success of Harvard over the past two generations 
together with its degree of worker management has created enormous internal pressures not to 
expand, the better to share out the surplus among the existing stakeholders.

If this story of Harvard-over-the-past-two-generations-as-the-socialist-Yugoslavia is correct, then 
a bunch of hard questions to which I do not know the answers are raised about:

• The judgment of those who have tried to satisfy their charitable impulses by giving $15B to my 
alma mater over the past two generations.

•  The proper incentives that the government should try to present to the institutiona€”and to 
those who might try to satisfy their charitable impulses in the future by adding to its endowment.

•  The responsibility of alumni like myself to try to influence the future governance of the 
institution: corporation members like Bob Reischauer know what is going on at least as well as I 
do, but seem to have been unable to move the institution.

•  The question of how Harvard should expand if indeed it should expand: it doesna€™ t seem to be 
nearly as good as the small liberal arts colleges or even its rivals Yale and Princeton at 
undergraduate education (I did very well, but only because I quickly found two placesa€“Social 
Studies in Hilles basement, and the graduate economics programa€“where Harvard was, effectively, a 
small college); the medical school and the biomedical complex
that surrounds it appears to do very well indeed as research institutions; the public policy school 
seems to have been an experiment worth trying that did not fulfill Derek Boka€™ s hopes, but that I 
cannot fully evaluate; few of the many people I know who went to the law school say many good words 
about it; et cetera.
