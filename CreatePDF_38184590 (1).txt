Paragraphs:

Abraham Lincoln: Pro-Slavery Theology: a€~The sum of pro-slavery theology seems to be this: 
"Slavery is not universally right, nor yet universally wrong; it is better for some people to be 
slaves; and, in such cases, it is
the Will of God that they be such. Certainly there is no contending against the Will of God; but 
still there is some difficulty in ascertaining, and applying it, to particular cases. For instance 
we will suppose the Rev. Dr.

Ross [2] has a slave named Sambo, and the question is a€oels it the Will of God that Sambo shall 
remain a slave, or be set free?a€D The Almighty gives no audable answer to the question, and his 
revelationa€”_the
Bible_a€”gives nonea€”r, at most, none but such as admits of a squabble, as to ita€™ s meaning. No 
one thinks of asking Samboa€™ s opinion on it. So, at last, it comes to this, that Dr. Ross is to 
decide the question. And
while    he considers] it, he sits in the shade, with gloves on his hands, and subsists on the 
bread that Sambo is earning in the burning sun. If he decides that God Wills Sambo to continue a 
slave, he thereby retains his own
comfortable position; but if he decides that God willa€™ s Sambo to be free, he thereby has to walk 
out of the shade, throw off his gloves, and delve for his own bread. Will Dr. Ross be actuated by 
that perfect impartiality,
which  has ever been considered most favorable to correct decisions?But, slavery is good for some 
people!!! As a good thing, slavery is strikingly perculiar, in this, that it is the only good thing 
which no man ever seeks the
good of, for himself. Nonsense! Wolves devouring lambs, not because it is good for their own greedy 
maws, but because it [is] good for the lambs!! !a€!

Matthew Yglesias: a€ceFuturea€ce & the Future of Media: a€~The crucial thing is this wouldna€™t 
just be a news site with a left-of-center brand (there are plenty of those), but rather one that 
deliberately tried to elevate
left-of-center ideas that are popular with swing voters. Conventional mediaa€! [has] young college 
graduates who live in big cities making stuff that appeals to their friends, who are also young 
college graduates who live in
big  cities. It gives a leftward spina€! but also a politically toxic framinga€!. Cultivate an 
older, more working-class audiencea€! mix straight news with coverage that focuses on the concrete 
material stakes in government.
Jon Tester delivering for Montana public lands. Joe Biden delivering an expanded Child Tax Credit. 
ARP funding keeping cops and teachers alike employed. You could also do inverse-Fox and elevate the 
most unpopular
right-wing ideas. Bring a well-connected Republican economist on to talk about how the minimum wage 
should be $0. Find a House backbencher who agrees and interview him. Get conservatives talking 
about how this is
what theya€™ d do if political considerations didna€™ t stop thema€!

Zachary Carter: The Second Death of Milton Friedman: a€~the secret to Friedmana€™ s success in the 
world of ideas was his ability to influence American liberalsa€! Rank-and-file conservative voters 
simply didna€™t
buy what Friedman was sellinga€!. Friedman argued that a free market economy liberated from every 
possible stricture of government oversight would serve as an effective way to root out racism from 
American societya€!
[as] racist policies would put the companies that practiced them at a competitive disadvantage^!. 
Not many conservatives believed it back in the 1960s, either. Goldwater supporters didna€™ t back 
him because they
expected him to wage a more rigorous crusade for racial justice than President Lyndon B. 
Johnsona€”they pulled the lever for Goldwater because they thought he would uphold the Jim Crow 
social ordera€!. [But] by
persuading  a good chunk of his political opponents that he shared their values and social goals, 
Friedman built support for a policy program that ultimately undermined those very liberal 
objectives. Democratsa€! did adopt
much                                                                                                
     of his economic worldview, believing it could be adapted to the partya€™ s broader social 
agenda. The ring of power did not have to be destroyed, but could be harnessed for progressive 
purposesa€!
