So he tried to wall off macroeconomics from everything else, and make it as inoffensive to laissez-faire sensibilities as possible…. [But] if markets can go so wrong that they cause Great Depressions, how can you be a free-market true believer on everything except macro?… American conservatism… had no room for any kind of interventionism, not even the sterilized, clean-room interventionism of Friedman’s monetarism.
