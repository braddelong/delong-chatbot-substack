The internal workings of Chat-GPT visualized as a Tron-style animation with lots of bright lights, 
colors, grids, and lens flares, by Stable Diffusion via NightCafe

I think: this is an occasionally hallucinatory conventional-wisdom generator:

I gave Chat-GPT a prompt:

Write a 1000 word New York Times-style op-ed in the style of Brad DeLong about productivity growth, 
making four points:

• First, worldwide productivity growth was relatively stable at an average of about 2% per year 
from 1870a€“2010 as a tremendous expansion in the STEM research-and-development workforce was 
offset by the harvesting of the low-hanging
technological fruit.

•  Second, the ramping up of the STEM research-and-development workforce is likely to soon reach 
its limits without a major reconfiguration of what world governments do, hence, the rate of growth 
is likely to decline.

•  Third, the 2% per year, productivity growth of1870 to 2010 was not enough to lead us to focus 
effectively on living wisely and well. Rather, the problems of equitably distributing and 
beneficently utilizing our material wealth continue to flummox us.

• Fourth, the arrival of global warming will derange economies and societies. Hence the next 50 
years are likely to see a world much richer than the last 50, but one that is significantly less 
happy and suffers significantly more in the way of human-caused
catastrophe.

Its response, with the pieces that it added in bold:

In recent years, there has been much discussion about productivity growth and its role in driving 
economic development. While it is true that productivity growth has been a key driver of economic 
growth over the past century, it is
important to understand that this growth has not been constant or evenly distributed. In fact, 
worldwide productivity growth has been relatively stable at an average of about 2% per year from 
1870 to 2010, with a tremendous expansion in the
STEM research-and-development workforce offset by the harvesting of the low-hanging technological 
fruit.

The first point to consider is that the 2% per year productivity growth seen from 1870 to 2010 was 
driven largely by the expansion of the STEM research-and-development workforce. This expansion was 
made possible by the growth of
educational institutions and the rising number of people with advanced degrees in science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics. As a result, new technologies and innovations were 
developed at a rapid pace, driving productivity
growth.

However, as the second point to consider, this expansion of the STEM workforce is likely to soon 
reach its limits without a major reconfiguration of what world governments do. In order to continue 
to drive productivity growth, we will need to

happy and suffers significantly more in the way of human-caused

However, as the second point to consider, this expansion of the STEM workforce is likely to soon 
reach its limits without a major reconfiguration of what world governments do. In order to continue 
to drive productivity growth, we will need to
reconfigure our research and development systems, invest in new and emerging technologies, and 
encourage more collaboration between the private sector and government. This is not only a task for 
government but also for
companies and private organizations. Without these changes, we can expect productivity growth to 
decline.

The third point to consider is that even with 2% per year productivity growth, we have not been 
able to effectively focus on living wisely and well. While the growth in productivity has certainly 
brought many material benefits, it has also
created significant challenges in terms of equitably distributing and beneficently utilizing our 
wealth. We still struggle with poverty and inequality, despite having more resources than ever 
before. Additionally, the growth in productivity
has not necessarily led to greater happiness or well-being for individuals and communities.

Finally, the fourth point to consider is that the arrival of global warming will derange economies 
and societies in the next 50 years. Climate change is already causing significant disruption to 
weather patterns and ecosystems, and it is likely to
only get worse in the coming years. This will have severe economic and social consequences, 
affecting everything from food production to infrastructure and human health. As a result, the next 
50 years are likely to see a world much
richer than the last 50, but one that is significantly less happy and suffers significantly more in 
the way of human-caused catastrophe.

In conclusion, productivity growth has been a key driver of economic development over the past 
century, but it is important to understand that this growth has not been constant or evenly 
distributed. To continue to drive productivity
growth and to address the many challenges facing our societies today, we must reconfigure our 
research and development systems, invest in new and emerging technologies, and encourage more 
collaboration between the private
sector  and government. Additionally, addressing the problems of equitably distributing and 
beneficently utilizing our material wealth, and tackling the global warming challenge, must be our 
priorities for the next 50 years.

But it had not gotten up to a full 1000 wordsa€”it had only gotten up to 500. So I nudged it again:

continue your discussion to a full 1000 words:

And it essentially freestyled:

While productivity growth has been a key driver of economic development, it is important to 
recognize that it is not a panacea for all of our problems. In fact, it has created some of its own 
challenges, and it is unclear whether it will be able to
continue driving economic growth in the future.

One of the biggest challenges created by productivity growth is the issue of income inequality. As 
productivity has increased, the benefits have not been evenly distributed across society. Instead, 
they have been concentrated in the hands of a small
elite, leading to a widening gap between the rich and the poor. This has led to increased social 
unrest and political polarization, as well as a host of other social problems. Additionally, It can 
lead to an unhealthy society where people who dona€™ t
have access to resources and opportunities to participate in economic growth, can have negative 
externalities on the overall economy.

Another challenge created by productivity growth is the issue of job displacement. As automation 
and other technological advances have increased productivity, they have also led to the 
displacement of millions of workers. This has led to increased
unemployment, underemployment, and a host of other social problems. Additionally, the changes in 
the economy, such as gig-working and short-term contracts, have resulted in a less secure 
employment for a significant part of the population.

Ita€™ s important to consider how the government and private organizations can address and mitigate 
these issues, for example, through retraining programs and policies that support secure employment.

A third challenge created by productivity growth is the issue of environmental degradation. As 
economies have grown and productivity has increased, we have seen a corresponding increase in 
carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. This
has led to global warming and other environmental problems that threaten to undermine economic 
growth and human well-being. Tackling this issue will require a concerted effort by governments, 
the private sector, and individuals to reduce our
carbon footprint and invest in cleaner, more sustainable technologies.

In order to continue to drive productivity growth and address these challenges, we will need to 
rethink our approach to research and development. As we have already seen, the expansion of the 
STEM research-and-development workforce has been
a key driver of productivity growth in the past. However, it is unclear whether we can continue to 
rely on this model in the future. Instead, we may need to reconfigure our research and development 
systems to focus on areas like renewable energy,
green technologies, and other forms of clean innovation.

Additionally, governments have a key role in setting up policies and regulations that encourages 
companies to invest in research and development, and to facilitate the technology transfer and 
commercialization. For example, tax incentives or
subsidies for research and development, intellectual property rights protections, or research 
collaboration agreements can incentivize the private sector to invest in research and development.

Another important step that governments can take is to invest more in education and training 
programs. As more and more jobs are automated, it will be essential to ensure that workers have the 
skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the new
economy. Additionally, investing in education can have positive externalities in the overall 
economy by increasing the number of people with advanced degrees and increasing the number of 
people working in STEM fields.

In conclusion, productivity growth has been a key driver of economic development over the past 
century, but it is important to recognize that it is not a panacea for all of our problems. It has 
created some of its own challenges and it is unclear
whether it will be able to continue driving economic growth in the future. In order to continue to 
drive productivity growth and address these challenges, we will need to rethink our approach to 
research and development, invest in education and
training programs, and consider the role of government in driving innovation and mitigating the 
negative effects of productivity growth.

As I said: an occasionally hallucinatory conventional-wisdom generator. After all, what else could 
it possibly be? Chat-GPT looks back at up to 4000 tokens (maybe 3000 words?) in the prompt(s), and 
then, probabilistically, it selects the next token to output. It was trained
on half a trillion words, and it has 175 billion connection weights between nodes.

And yet how it is wired together is not obvious to me, and it is not obvious why its wiring is the 
right wiring for us to be trying to build.

For example, when I feed it the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy, its response is not 
a€oedoga€D, period, followed by something else. It is:

The phrase "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy" is a well-known sentence that is used to test 
the quality of typefaces. The sentence uses every letter of the English alphabet, making it a good 
sentence to test thecompletenessof a typeface.
The sentence is also commonly used as a typing test and as a sentence that can be used to test the 
autocomplete function of a word processing program.

First, this is wrong. a€oeThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazya€D is not a sentence. It is not 
well-known. It is not used to test the quality of typefaces. All of those are true not of the 
prompt but of a€oeThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.a€D
What isright is that a€oeThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazya€D can be used to test the 
autocomplete function of a world processing program. And, as autocomplete, Chat-GPT has just 
flunked.

It is pretty clear to me what Chat-GPT did here:

•  It thought a€oeThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazya€D is almost the same as a€oeThe quick 
brown fox jumped over the lazy doga€D, so I will say the things that usually follow a€oea€oeThe 
quick brown fox jumped over the lazy doga€D

•  Thee are some occurrences of a€oeThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazya€D which are then soon 
followed by aCcetest the autocomplete functiona€D and aCceword processing programa€D, so I will 
output that as well.
This seems to me to be too word-cloudy to be likely to be successful. But, then, I also think that 
most oral and written communication is too word-cloudy to be well-designed for its purposesa€!
