Pascal Lamy: a€oeWhen the wise man points at the moon, the fool looks at the fingera€!a€D

Perhaps, in the end, the problem is that people want to pretend that they are filling a valuable 
role in the societal division of labor, and are receiving no more than they earna€”than they 
contribute. But that is not the case. The valuea€”the societal dividenda€”is in the accumulated 
knowledge of humanity and in the painfully constructed networks that make up our value chains.
A a€cecontributiona€D theory of what a proper distribution of income might be can only be made 
coherent if there are constant returns to scale in the scarce, priced, owned factors of production. 
Only then can you divide the pile of resources by giving to each the marginal societal product of 
their work and of the resources that they own.

That, however, is not the world we live in.

In a worlda€”like the one we live ina€”of mammoth increasing returns to unowned knowledge and to 
networks, no individual and no community is especially valuable. Those who receive good livings are 
those who are luckya€”as Carriera€™ s workers in Indiana have been lucky in living near Carriera€™ 
s initial location. Ita€™ s not that their contribution to society is large or that their luck is 
replicable: if it were, they would not care (much) about the
departure of Carrier because there would be another productive network that they could fit into a 
slot in.

All of this a€oewhat you deservea€D language is tied up with some vague idea that you deserve what 
you contributed’’that what your work adds to the pool of societya€™ s resources is what you 
deserve.

This illusion is punctured by any recognition that there is a large societal dividend to be 
distributed, and that the government can distribute it by supplementing (inadequate) market wages 
determined by your (low) societal marginal product, or by explicitly providing income support or 
services unconnected with work via social insurance. Instead, the government is supposed to, 
somehow, via clever redistribution, rearrange the pattern of market power in the
economy so that the increasing-returns knowledge- and network-based societal dividend is 
predistributed in a relatively egalitarian way so that everybody can pretend that their income is 
just a€oeto each according to his worka€D, and that they are not heirs and heiresses coupon 
clipping off of the societal capital of our predecessorsa€™ accumulated knowledge and networks.

On top of this we add: Polanyian disruption of patterns of lifea€”local communities, income levels, 
industrial specialization^’’that you believed you had a right to obtain or maintain, and a right to 
believe that you deserve. But in a market capitalist society, nobody has a right to the 
preservation of their local communities, to their income levels, or to an occupation in their 
industrial specialization. In a market capitalist society, those survive only if they pass a
market profitability test. And so the only rights that matter are those property rights that at the 
moment carry with them market powera€”the combination of the (almost inevitably low) marginal 
societal products of your skills and the resources you own, plus the (sometimes high) market power 
that those resources grant to you.

This wish to believe that you are not a moocher is what keeps people from seeing issues of 
distribution and allocation clearlya€”and generates hostility to social insurance and to wage 
supplement policies, for they rip the veil off of the idea that you deserve to be highly paid 
because you are worth it. You arena€™t.

And this ties itself up with regional issues: regional decline can come very quickly whenever a 
region finds that its key industries have, for whatever reason, lost the market power that diverted 
its previously substantial share of the knowledge- and network-based societal dividend into the 
coffers of its firms. The resources cannot be simply redeployed in other industries unless those 
two have market power to control the direction of a share of the knowledge- and
network-based societal dividend. And so communities decline and die. And the social 
contracta€’’which was supposed to have given you a right to a healthy communitya€”is broken.

As I have said before, humans are, at a very deep and basic level, gift-exchange animals. We create 
and reinforce our social bonds by establishing patterns of a€ceowinga€D other people and by 
a€oebeing oweda€D. We want to enter into reciprocal gift-exchange relationships. We create and 
reinforce social bonds by giving each other presents. We like to give. We like to receive. We like 
neither to feel like cheaters nor to feel cheated. We like, instead, to feel
embedded in networks of mutual reciprocal obligation. We dona€™ t like being too much on the 
downside of the gift exchange: to have received much more than we have given in return makes us 
feel very small. We dona€™ t like being too much on the upside of the gift exchange either: to give 
and give and give and never receive makes us feel like suckers.

and give and give and never receive makes us feel like suckers.

We want to be neither cheaters nor saps.

It is, psychologically, very hard for most of us to feel like we are being takers: that we are 
consuming more than we are contributing, and are in some way dependent on and recipients of the 
charity of others. It is also, psychologically, very hard for most of us to feel like we are being 
saps: that others are laughing at us as they toil not yet consume what we have produced.

And it is on top of this evopsych propensity to be gift-exchange animalsa€”what Adam Smith called 
our a€oenatural propensity to truck, barter, and exchangea€Da€”we have built our complex economic 
division of labor. We construct property and market exchangea€”what Adam Smith called our natural 
propensity a€oeto truck, barter, and exchangea€D to set and regulate expectationsof what the fair, 
non-cheater non-sap terms of  gift-exchange over time
are.

We devise money as an institution as a substitute for the trust needed in a gift-exchange 
relationship, and we thus construct a largely-peaceful global 7.4B-strong highly-productive 
societal division of labor, built on:

assigning things to ownersa€”who thus have both the responsibility for stewardship and the 
incentive to be good stewardsa€! very large-scale webs of win-win exchangea€! mediated and 
regulated by market pricesa€! There are enormous benefits to arranging things this way. As soon as 
we enter into a gift-exchange relationship with someone or something we will see againa€’’perhaps 
oftena€”it will automatically shade over into the friend zone. This is just
who we are. And as soon as we think about entering into a gift-exchange relationship with someone, 
we think better of them. Thus a large and extended division of labor mediated by the market version 
of gift-exchange is a ver powerful creator of social harmony.

This is what the wise Albert Hirschman called the doux commerce thesis. People, as economists 
conceive them, are not a€ceHobbesiansa€D focusing on their narrow personal self-interest, but 
rather a€oeLockeiansa€D: believers in live-and-let live, respecting others and their spheres of 
autonomy, and eager to enter into reciprocal gift-exchange relationships^’’both one-offs mediated 
by cash alone and longer-run ones as well.

In an economists™ s imagination, people do not enter a butcherS™ s shop only when armed cap-a-pie 
and only with armed guards. They do not fear that the butcher will knock him unconscious, take his 
money, slaughter him, smoke him, and sell him as long pig.
Rather, there is a presumed underlying order of property and ownership that is largely 
self-enforcing, that requires only a Soenight watchmana€□ to keep it stable and secure.

Yet to keep the fiction that we are all fairly playing the reciprocal game of gift exchange in a 
7.4 billion-strong social networks’’that we are neither cheaters nor sapsS”we need to ignore that 
we are coupon clippers living off of our societal inheritance.

And to do this, we need to do more than (a) set up a framework for the production of stuff, (b) set 
up a framework for the distribution of stuff, and so (c) create a very dense reciprocal network of 
interdependencies to create and reinforce our belief that we are all one society.

We need to do so in such a way that people do not see themselves, are not seen as sapsS”people who 
are systematically and persistently taken advantage of by others in their societal and market 
gift-exchange relationships. We need to do so in such a way that people do not see themselves, are 
not seen as, and are not moochersa€’’people who systematically persistently take advantage of 
others in their societal and market gift-exchange relationships. We need to
do this in the presence of a vast increasing-returns in the knowledge- and network-based societal 
dividend and in spite of the low societal marginal product of any one of us.

Thus we need to do this via clever redistribution rather than via explicit wage supplements or 
basic incomes or social insurance that robs people of the illusion that what they receive is what 
they have earned and what they are worth through their work.
Now I think it is an open question whether it is harder to do the job via predistribution, or to do 
the job via changing human perceptions to get everybody to understand that:

• no, none of us is worth what we are paid.

• we are all living, to various extents, off of the dividends from our societal capital

• those of us who are doing especially well are those of us who have managed to luck into 
situations in which we have market powera€”in which the resources we control are (a) scarce, (b) 
hard to replicate quickly, and (c) help produce things that rich people have a serious jones for 
right now.
