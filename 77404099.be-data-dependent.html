DeLong dismisses things that were done, or not done, without appreciating the difficult politics of the moment (he later describes the issues... in general). Also, I feel like the pessimistic tone at the end is based on the Trump administration and things have gotten quite a bit better of late. His "index of the stock of good ideas" seems like an inside joke he never quite lets us in on. Nevertheless, I feel he's made a good case that the US has daunting challenges ahead to return to the growth of the past.</p></blockquote><p>I would say that the fact that the politics of the moment were “difficult”—especially including the fact that a critical mass of White House staffers over 2009-2012 thought that David Brooks was a really smart guy and that their highest-priority task was to seek his approval—was (most of) my point there.

Bradford DeLong</a>: ‘These historical asides are so winningly conversational that they very much help to make the book’s 600 pages surprisingly easy reading. Part of this is likewise attributable to DeLong’s semi-ironic adoption of a “grand narrative” (even though Ludwig Wittgenstein considered such grand narratives “nonsense”), which he doesn’t exactly hide under a bushel. One of the main reasons why humanity’s progress towards utopia has been more of a slouch than a march, you might ask? DeLong cites many factors (this is not a simple book, much though you at times get the impression its author would have liked it to be), but his central villain is gently indicated when he refers to the market economy as “that Mammon of Unrigtheousness.” The free market economy pops up repeatedly in these pages, always wearing a dark, oily mustache like Daniel Day-Lewis deep in character as a homicidal maniac. People are no sooner starting to feel some free-range autonomy, able to smile and play with their children and lay away a little nest egg for the future, when suddenly up pops the market economy to ruin everything…. The crucial economic watershed in DeLong’s long century was the enactment of one of the single worst acts of public pillaging since Alaric sacked Rome: the neoliberalist fantasy-religion of supply-side economics…</p></blockquote><p>As a (somewhat reformed) left-neoliberal myself, </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Must-Read: <strong>Nuclear Blackmail</strong></h2><p>This is very good:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Robert Farley</strong>: &lt;sarcasm&gt;<a href="https://twitter.com/drfarls/status/1579099368053170176">‘As an anti-imperialist</a> and an anti-nuclear activist, I believe that the possession of nuclear weapons gives a country the right to seize any chunk of any neighbor at any given time.’&lt;/sarcasm&gt; </p><p>To treat the issue a bit more seriously:</p><ul><li><p>It should be obvious to everyone that the international community ought not roll over in a case in which a nuclear power has seized chunks of its neighbor and then resorts to nuclear threats to hold that territory. </p></li><li><p>This would be the kind of Bad Precedent that the term "bad precedent" was invented for. It would be catastrophic for nuclear arms control, non-proliferation policy, etc.</p></li></ul><p>An intellectually coherent policy could probably be constructed around "negotiated settlement under threat, combined with aggressive sanctions regime designed for quasi-permanent containment.” This would recognize the gravity of the situation while also recognizing Russia's grave transgressions against international law and norms of international society. And it's possible that there are folks out there who are advocating something along these lines. I don't agree that we should roll over for every Russian nuclear threat but the argument has some weight. </p><p>Unfortunately, most of the folks I'm seeing call for negotiations based on Russia's nuclear threats also tend to be extremely squishy on the idea that Russia should be asked to pay any costs at all for the destructive invasion of its neighbor.</p><p>I've agreed from the start that this war will end in negotiation, while at the same time maintaining that the nature and character of negotiation will be determined by the military situation. But negotiation does not mean that Russia gets what it wants territorially, or that Russia escapes the long-term consequences of the war that it started. The re-integration of Russia into international society (at least in terms of its relationship with Europe, which Russia has historically regarded as a core interest) is a long-term question that won't be decided at the negotiating table with Ukraine. Things won't go back to the way they were. Progressive foreign policy thinkers who used to care about international law, nuclear proliferation, and norms of appropriate international behavior should keep this in mind…</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/be-data-dependent/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/be-data-dependent/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><h2>Other Things That Went Whizzing By…</h2><h3>Very Briefly Noted:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Martin Sandbu</strong>: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d1092d1-5dec-47ce-81bc-be5cb99392cc">Central banks are risking the best jobs market in a generation</a>: ‘They are about to address a cost of living shock by willingly inflicting a hit to growth…</p></li><li><p><strong>Rana Foroohar</strong>: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e04bc664-04b2-4ef6-90f9-64e9c4c126aa">The new rules for business in a post-neoliberal world</a>: ‘Laissez-faire economics in the US is slowly being replaced by a more intensive policy focus from start to finish…</p></li><li><p><strong>Dexter Roberts</strong>: <a href="https://dexter.substack.com/p/trade-war-c5a?utm_source=email">Trade War</a>: ‘The IMF has described China as a “global outlier.” The country’s gross domestic savings as a percentage of GDP is 44 percent, compared with an average of 22.5 percent among OECD members.

[The] Truss, it was a gift to her narrative, that Britain is being held back by an “anti-growth coalition” of eco-loons, “militant unions”, “Brexit deniers”, “talking heads” and the opposition…. I wasn’t surprised by her failure to apologise for disastrous economic mismanagement, or by her patronising nursery-school lecture that we can all get a bigger slice if we grow the pie. What spooked me was her portrayal of anyone who disagrees with her as an enemy—an enemy of growth, an enemy of the state…. It was vindictive of Truss to purge the cabinet of its few remaining talents because they didn’t give her sufficiently full-throated backing in the leadership contest. It was also foolish. She has made an enemy of Michael Gove, who has already forced her to U-turn on cutting the top rate of tax, and now aims to stop her cutting welfare.
