There are not enough of the dotted-red a€oegene flowa€D lines: there should be gene-flow 
everywhere. Paleo-West Africans surely mated in substantial numbers with modern West Africans. The 
Khoi-San South African population mated with both East and West Africans. West Africans mated with 
Europeans and East Africans, East Africans mated
with West Africans and West Asians, and everybody descended from the founding population that moved 
across the Red Sea in the last out-of-Africa world-diffusion migration mated not just with one 
another as people moved back-and-forth across Eurasia, but mated with the Neanderthals and 
Denisovans they found where they were goinga€”and then
people came back to Africa as well, and mated. People are people. Exogamy is a very powerful force. 
And the seas are not that wide, the mountains not that high, the deserts not that wide. Thus 
a€oedivergencea€D is a term of great art here: it is that populations become separate enough that 
gene-flow between them is materially slower than gene-flow
within them.

But there is gene-flow.

And that tells us that there was considerable commonality in the shared mental universes and in the 
understanding of pair-bonding and gift-exchange protocols among the gene-flowers. You get a lot 
more gene-flow out of wooing than out of rape-and-run, which is highly likely to be a very 
lifespan-limiting move in most places and at most times before
the development of an extractive military caste.

The belief that there was one East African population that, less than 80,000 years ago, acquired a 
set of mutationsa€’’biological and culturala€”that then gave them a sufficient edge to crowd all of 
their cousins out of their niches worldwide is now much harder to maintain. Yes, the existence of 
the a€oeuncanny valleya€D phenomenon may mean that
sometimes our ancestors and their close cousins interacted very violently when they came upon one 
another. But the gene-flow does point to shared mental universes:

Frankly, I do not understand how this could be. I find myself thinking very dark thoughts about 
culture-gene coevolutiona€”how your genes come from a predominate source but many other sources, 
but how cultures grow on their own, and then clash violently way back in human history. If you are 
on the losing end, you are lucky if only your men die
(save for a few who are assimilated). But you may all die if resources seem scarce, and if some 
jacked-up charismatic figure says that the Storm God of the Semites demands it:

And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt. 
And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the 
edge of the sword. But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, 
and of the fallings, and the
lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and 
refuse, that they destroyed utterly.

Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying: a€oelt repenteth me that I have set up Saul to 
be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments .a€D And 
it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night. And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in 
the morning, it
was told Samuel, saying, a€oeSaul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone 
about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.a€D

And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, a€oeBlessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed 
the commandment of the Lord.a€D
And Samuel said, a€oeWhat meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of 
the oxen which I hear?a€C

And Saul said, a€oeThey have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of 
the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly 
destroyed.a€D
Then Samuel said unto Saul,a€D Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this 
night.a€D

And he said unto him, a€oeSay on.a€D

And Samuel said, a€oeWhen thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the 
tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel? And the LORD sent thee on a journey, 
and said, a€~Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they 
be consumed.a€™
Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst 
evil in the sight of the LORD?a€D

And Saul said unto Samuel, a€oeYea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way 
which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the 
Amalekites.a€D But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which 
should have been utterly
destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.

And Samuel said, a€oeHath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in 
obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the 
fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and 
idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of
the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.a€D 1 Samuel 15:7-23

anthology-intelligence fitness-multiplier that we have evolved to be a suitable platform for:

Joseph Henrich (2015): The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, 
Domesticating Our Species, & Making Us Smarter (Princeton: Princeton University Press) 
<https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Secret of Our Success/HFHpCAAAQBAJ>: a€~Gesher Benot 
Ya'aqov has yielded rich
insights into the life of one society around 750,000 years ago. The extensive remains indicate the 
existence and persistence of hearths and areas for both stone-tool manufacturing and food 
processing. The inhabitants controlled fire and made a variety of stone tools, including hand axes, 
cleavers, blades, knives, awls, scrapers,
and choppers. Made from flint, basalt, and limestone, tool manufacture was done on-site, often from 
giant slabs carried in from a distant quarry by a team. Some of the basalt slabs have notches, 
indicating the use of levers as part of the quarrying process. The basalt is of the highest quality 
and well quarried, suggesting that
someone had a storehouse of know-how on the topic.

The inhabitants of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov also, somehow, obtained freshwater crabs, turtles, 
reptiles, and at least nine types of fish, including carp, sardines, and catfish. Some of these 
fish were big, longer than a meter. On top of this, there were seeds, acorns, olives, grapes, nuts, 
water chestnuts, and various other fruits. This
bounty included the submerged prickly water lily, which grows well away from shore. It also appears 
that they were cracking nuts open and roasting acorns to remove their shells and perhaps reduce the 
bitter tannins. They may even have made a€cepopcorna€D by roasting the seeds from the prickly water 
lily, as has been done
for thousands of years in India and China.

Clearly, cumulative cultural evolution is up and running at this point, generating more know-how 
than you, me, or our lost European Explorers could have ginned up in a lifetime. If you arena€™ t 
sure, go quarry some high-quality basalt slabs (youa€™ 11 need a lever, I think), make a beautiful 
hand axe with full symmetry
(remember to make that antler or bone hammer first), bring down an elephanta€l

There is all this. And there is also dealing with the fact that we are all descended, in the male 
lines at least, from people who not only did not study war no more, but studied war so intensively 
that they got very, very good at ita€”that is profoundly disturbing on many levels.

And Samuel said, a€oeHath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in 
obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the 
fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and 
idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of
the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.a€D 1 Samuel 15:7-23

Cultures giving us our extraordinary collective powers to survive, flourish, and spread. And our 
cultures being enormous threats not just to the lives but to the gene-lines of our neighbors.
We have been doing the a€oeculturea€D thing for a long timea€”it has been the time-binding 
anthology-intelligence fitness-multiplier that we have evolved to be a suitable platform for:

Ya'aqov has yielded rich
insights into the life of one society around 750,000 years ago. The extensive remains indicate the 
existence and persistence of hearths and areas for both stone-tool manufacturing and food 
processing. The inhabitants controlled fire and made a variety of stone tools, including hand axes, 
cleavers, blades, knives, awls, scrapers,
and choppers. Made from flint, basalt, and limestone, tool manufacture was done on-site, often from 
giant slabs carried in from a distant quarry by a team. Some of the basalt slabs have notches, 
indicating the use of levers as part of the quarrying process. The basalt is of the highest quality 
and well quarried, suggesting that
someone had a storehouse of know-how on the topic.

The inhabitants of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov also, somehow, obtained freshwater crabs, turtles, 
reptiles, and at least nine types of fish, including carp, sardines, and catfish. Some of these 
fish were big, longer than a meter. On top of this, there were seeds, acorns, olives, grapes, nuts, 
water chestnuts, and various other fruits. This
bounty included the submerged prickly water lily, which grows well away from shore. It also appears 
that they were cracking nuts open and roasting acorns to remove their shells and perhaps reduce the 
bitter tannins. They may even have made a€cepopcorna€D by roasting the seeds from the prickly water 
lily, as has been done
for thousands of years in India and China.

Clearly, cumulative cultural evolution is up and running at this point, generating more know-how 
than you, me, or our lost European Explorers could have ginned up in a lifetime. If you arena€™ t 
sure, go quarry some high-quality basalt slabs (youa€™ 11 need a lever, I think), make a beautiful 
hand axe with full symmetry
(remember to make that antler or bone hammer first), bring down an elephanta€l

There is all this. And there is also dealing with the fact that we are all descended, in the male 
lines at least, from people who not only did not study war no more, but studied war so intensively 
that they got very, very good at ita€”that is profoundly disturbing on many levels.
