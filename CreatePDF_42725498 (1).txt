Kevin M. Kruse: d€™ Same guy, ten days apart. Goddammit, this one might have broken me. a€oeLook, 
ita€™ s common for normal people to spend $18k/month on their mortgages and have a live-in nanny

I know a guy who lives in a 3br apartment in Manhattan with his wife and
kid.

Here’s a estimate of their monthly expenses:

$18k mortgage

$2k HOA

$3k prop tax

$0.5k parking

$16k 24/7 nanny

$5k food & entertainment

$2k travel

@Molson_Hart

In rural Texas we posted a $14/hour part-time cash
container unloading job.

No one showed up.

Now our team of 2 is unloading 35,000 pounds of
Brain Flakes themselves.

Wild that $14 isn’t enough these days.

Pictures are old and for plush but it gives you an idea.

$46,500/month

$1,116,000 of pretax income per year.

So on first glance this looks totally extravagant but it’s not actually. Yeah
sure one could move farther out and pay less but if you want to live in
Manhattan with a kid and have two working parents you kinda need a 3br
and   24/7 help right? Of course one could get out of NYC too

Yeon-Koo Che & Olivier Tercieux: Optimal Queue Design'. a€™ We study the optimal design of a 
queueing system when agentsa€™ arrival and servicing are governed by a general Markov process. The 
designer chooses entry and exit rules for agents, their service prioritya€”or queueing 
disciplined”as well as their information, while ensuring they have incentives to follow 
recommendations to join the queue and, importantly, to stay in the queue. Under a
mild condition, at the optimal mechanism, agents are induced to enter up to a certain queue length 
and no agents are to exit the queue; agents are served according to a first-come-first-served 
(FCFS) rule; and they are given no information throughout the process beyond the recommendations 
they receive from the designer. FCFS is also necessary for optimality in a rich domain. We identify 
a novel role for queueing disciplines in regulating agentsa€™ beliefs,
and their dynamic incentives, thus uncovering a hitherto unrecognized virtue of FCFS in this 
regarda€!

Andrei Frumusanu: The Apple Al5 SoC Performance Review: Faster & More Efficient'. a€~Todaya€™ s 
investigation into the new A15 is just scratching the tip of the iceberg of what Apple has to offer 
in the new generation iPhone 13 series devices. As wea€™re still working on the full device review, 
we got a good glimpse of what the new silicon is able to achieve, and what to expect from the new 
devices in terms of performance. On the CPU side of
thingsa€! the new A15 improvementsa€!. Wea€™re elated to see that it wasa€! an efficiency focus 
this year, with the new performance cores showcasing adequate performance improvements, while at 
the same time reducing power consumption, as well as significantly improving energy efficiency. The 
efficiency cores of the A15 have also seen massive gains, this time around with Apple mostly 
investing them back into performance, with the new cores
showcasing +23a€“28% absolute performance improvements, something that isna€™t easily identified by 
popular benchmarking. This large performance increase further helps the SoC improve energy 
efficiency, and our initial battery life figures of the new 13 series showcase that the chip has a 
very large part into the vastly longer longevity of the new devicesa€!

Rick Perlstein (2005): a€™ I Didna€™ t Like Nixon Until Watergatea€™: The Conservative Movement 
Now. a€™I was part of the panel a€oeBarry Goldwater and the Modern Conservative Movement, a€D 
alongside Lee Edwards and M. Stanton Evansa€!. [I said: a€oeA] thread one finds throughout the 
annals of the Nixon presidencya€! that what they were doing was moral, the eggs that need be broken 
in the act of redeeming a crumbling Westa€!.
a€DJust remember youa€™re doing the right thing,a€oe the president told Bob Haldeman on Easter 
Sunday, 1973. a€ETThata€™ s what I used to think when I killed some innocent children in Hanoi.a€oe 
Then he briefed him on how to suborn perjury from an aide concerning the blackmailing of the 
Watergate burglarsa€!. My subjects from the youth conservative movement of the 1960s, the ones that 
later came to inherit the world, presented] themselvesa€!
on  the one hand, beaming, telling me stories of principle. On the other, sometimes in the same 
breath, winkingly defining political deviancy down, telling Hustonian tales of antinomial 
subterfuge. Peeling off opposition bumper stickers with razor blades, jamming Rockefeller phone 
banks, working to subvert the 1961 National Student Association convention by setting up a dummy 
a€DMiddle of the Road Caucus .a€oea€! My thesis [is] that the Republicans are
less the party of Goldwater, and more the party of Watergatea€!. Nixon knew that if you had a dirty 
job to get down, you got people who answered to the descriptiona€!.a€D Postscript: The response to 
my address was, understandably, defensive. My co-panelist Stan Evans retorted that my invocation of 
Richard Nixon was inappropriate because Nixon had never been a genuine conservative. He added: 
a€oel didna€™ t like Nixon until Watergate.a€D I
responded: a€ceThanks for making my pointa€Da€!

Ariel Rubinstein (2013): 10 Q&A: Experienced Advice for a€ceLosta€L2Graduate Students in 
Economics'. a€~These informal comments are those of Ariel Rubinstein delivered at a Wine and Cheese 
party at NYU, October 28,2011, and were expanded on by the author at the invitation of the editors 
(revised January 2013). Readers who find Rubinsteina€™ s comments interesting are encouraged to go 
to his Web site, <http://arielrubinstein .tau .ac .il>, and to
look at his new book, Economic Fables, which raises a number of issues directly related to

Julian Sanchez: a€™ Recently binged a few debates on the historicity of the Gospels between New 
Testament scholar Bart Ehrman & various apologists, and kept thinking how much less plausible so 
many key apologist arguments sound in the age of QAnona€!. A lot of apologetics on this front boil 
down to the idea that ita€™ s wildly implausible that people would spread unfounded stories or 
sheer fabrications with such speed and conviction, often at
substantial personal cost. And yeta€! The parallels area€! eerie. A messianic figure (whose early 
followers often wonder a€oeWho are you?a€D) prophecies a major sociopolitical upheaval that will 
overthrow the corrupt powers that be and institute a new kingdom. The prophecy fails, but (many of) 
the followers are undeterred. The apparent falsification of the predicted revolution is 
reinterpreted as part of a larger plan, and the betrayal of the prophet as a
necessary step in leading the mass public to a greater spiritual truth. Believers begin circulating 
personal accounts of miraculous occurences consistent with the narrative. (Ivermectin healed me! I 
received a vision of PCAPs proving election fraud! I saw the fake ballots being hauled in on a 
truck!) Some of these are straight grifts. Many are earnest misunderstandings of real experiences. 
These are exaggerated and stripped of ambiguity in repeated retelling,
coming to be treated as indisputable facts that a€oeeverybody knows,a€D at least within the 
communitya€!. Political authorities, initially disdainful of the new movement, begin to view it as 
a force to be harnessed and convert (or purport to), accelerating the spread and lending the 
movementa€™ s narratives credibility with a wider audiencea€!
