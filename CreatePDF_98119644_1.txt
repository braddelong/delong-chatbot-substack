Perhaps there was progress in macroeconomics back before 1940. Certainly by 1940 it was the 
consensus of economists that the claim of Josef Schumpeter and others that depressions were a 
necessary "functional" part of capitalisma€”an inevitable concomitant of adjustment to change in 
the creative-destruction process of modern economic growtha€”was dead as a doornail. It was 131 
years since John Stuart Mill had first argued that a€oegeneral
glutsa€D excess supplies of pretty much every produced commodity and of labor, are the flip side of 
an excess demand for money.

It had taken 131 years to achieve this consensus. It was achieved only after the rude interruption 
of the discourse of economic theory by the Great Depression. There were unsettled questions about 
which aspects of money were key to the destructive excess demanda€”liquidity? safety? 
collateralizable nominal value? Its use as a savings vehicle? And there were unsettled questions 
about whether central banks performing open-market and lender-of-
last-resort operations could do the stabilization policy job, or whether a somewhat comprehensive 
socialization of investment would be required.

Since then, however, whether there has been significant progress is doubtful. Alan Blinder's new A 
Monetary and Fiscal History of the United States, 1961-2021 describes a game of constant musical 
chairs without the number of chairs ever decreasing, or perhaps a game of whack-a-mole:
of wheels within wheels, spinning endlessly in time and space a€l [with] certain themes a€l waxing 
and waning a€l monetary versus fiscal a€l the intellectual realm a€l the world of practical policy 
making a€l the repeated ascendance and descendence of Keynesianisma€l

Abstract: Inflation in America after WWII It peaked at 19.7% in the twelve months to March 1947. 
Americaa€™ s economy reoriented itself from its wartime to its post-war structural configuration. 
The Federal Reserve did nothing at all. Inflation went negative in 1949 with a minor recession 
came. The fourth episode came in 1951, and was in some ways a reverse of 1947a€”not a 
demobilization but a remobilization inflation. Again, the Federal
Reserve did nothing. And, again, the inflation wave passed. And then came the long siege of 
moderate inflation that took place between 1966 and 1984, as the Federal Reserve dithered before 
the Volcker disinflation. What policy you think would have been and will be appropriate for the 
Biden administration and the Yellen-Powell Fed depends on which of these past historical episodes 
provides the best model and analogy for the state of the US
economy today. The odds right now seem to me to be on the first two, rather than the thirda€!
