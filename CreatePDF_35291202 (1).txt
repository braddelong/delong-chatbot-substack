Jamelle Bouie: F.D.R. Didna€™ t Just Fix the Economy. a€~He saved democracy itselfa€!. Asa€! Eric 
Rauchway argues in hisa€! a€oeWhy the New Deal Matters,a€D a
recovery program for American democracya€!. These days we tend to think of the New Deal as a very 
large stimulus program. And that was true, to an extenta€! Buta€! the New
Deal was biggera€!. Rauchwaya€! writes: a€oeThe foundational belief of the New Deal was the 
conviction that democracy in the United Statesa€”limited and flawed through it
remaineda€”was better kept than abandoned, in the hope of strengthening and extending it.a€Da€l

a€~[Some] Americans at the top who believed democracy had failed the country. In Gen. Douglas 
MacArthura€™ s draconian response to the Bonus marchersa€’’burning their
camps and driving them out of the city, against President Herbert Hoovera€™ s explicit 
ordersa€”they saw a model for how the government might restore a€ceordera€D to the
United States. a€oeTo his aide Rexford Tugwell,a€D Rauchway notes, a€oeRoosevelt described Douglas 
MacArthur as one of the a€~most dangerous men in the

country.a€™ a€D MacArthur appealed to Americans who yearned for a strongman, who believed 
a€oedemocracy had run its course and that the totalitarians had grasped the
necessities of the time.a€D Roosevelt said that among people he knewa€”rich people, who came from 
privileged backgrounds and who found the mobilized people deeply
alarminga€”such talk was commonplace.

a€~Roosevelt had to prove to all Americans that self-government worked; that it could restore 
confidence and tackle the economic crisis without compromising the principles of the
revolution and the foundinga€!

Paragraphs:

John Holbo: The Steelwool Scruba€”A Fallacy. a€~isna€™t it awfully mean, ad hominem and unfair if 
thoughtful Christian philosophers and theologians, Thomistic would-be
anthropologists, get lumped in with bog-standard bigots?a€! There IS an element of unfairness. But 
now we come to the tell. Who should Ryan T. Anderson-types be indignant
with,                                                                                    by rights, 
for unfairly trashing his reputation? Well, that would obviously be, first and foremost, the bigots 
he is consistently mistaken fora€!. Within the ecosystem of
Christian cultural politics and belief, the role of someone like Ryan T. Anderson is not to scourge 
conservative Christians for having something in the neighborhood of right
attitudes, but only as a culturally bigoted, hence surely spiritually poisonous inheritance of 
animus. Rather, his role is to apologize for bad attitudes as defensible and righteousa€”to
ensure no one can call bigotry a€~bigotrya€™ , by inserting himself in the line of fire as a model, 
steel-reinforced unbigot. This isa€! belief launderinga€!. A money launderer does
not help criminals go straighta€! but mostly helps criminals appear to go straight, while not doing 
so. So this is what I call the Steelwool Scrub. Somehow, if there is one
steelmana€”or even if there just could be onea€’’everyone actually gets scrubbed clean by proxy

John Quiggin: Generational Replacement & the Leftward Shift of the Democrats'. a€~Political views 
formed in early adulthood are quite durable, particularly when they are the
result of very good or very bad economic outcomes. The New Deal produced a generation with large 
numbers of lifelong Democratic voters, while the prosperity of the 1950s gave
rise to Republican majorities in the Silent Generation^!. Until recently, the leading voices among 
Democrats and centrists came from a cohort whose views on economic policy
issues were formed during the rise and seeming triumph of neoliberalism, from the early 1970s to 
the end of the 20th century. The ideal among this group was to be a€~socially
liberal and economically conservative^™ , without going too far in either direction.a€! LINK:

Paul Graham: How People Get Rich Now: a€~In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. 
Of the 100 richest people, 60 inheriteda€!. By 2020 the number of heirs
had been cut in half, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunesa€!. How are people making 
these new fortunes? Roughly 3/4 by starting companies and 1/4 bya€!
managing investment funds. There were no fund managers among the 100 richest Americans in 1982a€!. 
In 1982, there were two dominant sources of new wealth: oil and real
estate.    Of the 40 new fortunes in 1982, at least 24 were due primarily to oil or real estatea€!. 
Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020,4 were due to real estate and only 2 to oila€L The oil
and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400 didna€™ t win by making better technology. They won 
by being really driven and good at making dealsa€!. In 1892, the New York
Herald Tribune compiled a list of all the millionaires in America. They found 4047 of them. How 
many had inherited their wealth then? Only about 20%a€! LINK:
