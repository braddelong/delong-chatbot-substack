It has two and a half pages on how World War I, the 1920s, and the Great Depression shattered confidence in the pseudo-classical semi-liberal order inherited from the Belle Époque, the Economic Eldorado of 1870-1913; two pages on Lenin’s version of socialism as one of the competing frameworks bidding for the power to lead humanity into the future and how it did not work “I give little away when I tell you really-existing socialism was… the most murderous of the totalitarian ideologies of the twentieth century…”; two and a half pages on Marx; two and a half pages on what Marx got wrong and yet how he was taken not for an analyst but a prophet; and seven pages on Russia, the Bolsheviks, the October Revolution, and War Communism to bring us to this excerpt:</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Initially, the attempt [to “build socialism” in one very poor country] required stepping back from war communism and into the “New Economic Policy,” which required letting prices rise and fall, letting people buy and sell and get richer, letting managers of government factories make profits (or be sacked), and letting a class of merchants and middlemen grow, as what Keynes called “tolerated outlaws.” It was an expediency. Capitalism, but subject to state control; socialized state enterprises, but run on a profit basis. And while the leash was rarely tugged, it remained.</strong></p><p><strong>Part of the expedience was due to the fact that the centralized Soviet government had limited grasp. Even by the mid-1930s, the planners could only track material balances for about one hundred commodities. The movements of these were indeed centrally planned. Nationwide, producers of these commodities who did not fulfill their goals according to the plan were sanctioned. Otherwise, commodities were exchanged between businesses and shipped out to users either through standard market cash-on-the-barrelhead transactions or via </strong><em><strong>blat</strong></em><strong>: connections. Who you knew mattered.</strong></p><p><strong>When </strong><em><strong>blat</strong></em><strong>, market exchange, or central planning failed to obtain the raw materials an enterprise needed, there was another option: the </strong><em><strong>tolkachi</strong></em><strong>, or barter agents. </strong><em><strong>Tolkachi</strong></em><strong> would find out who had the goods you needed, what they were valued, and what goods you might be able to acquire given what you had to barter with.</strong></p><p><strong>If this sounds degrees familiar, it should.</strong></p><p><strong>One hidden secret of capitalist business is that most companies’ internal organizations are a lot like the crude material balance calculations of the Soviet planners. Inside the firm, commodities and time are not allocated through any kind of market access process. Individuals want to accomplish the mission of the organization, please their bosses so they get promoted, or at least so they don’t get fired, and assist others. They swap favors, formally or informally. They note that particular goals and benchmarks are high priorities, and that the top bosses will be displeased if they are not accomplished. They use social engineering and arm-twisting skills. They ask for permission to outsource, or dig into their own pockets for incidentals. Market, barter, </strong><em><strong>blat</strong></em><strong>, and plan, this last understood as the organization’s primary purposes and people’s allegiance to it, always rule, albeit in different proportions.</strong></p><p><strong>The key difference, perhaps, is that a standard business firm is embedded in a much larger market economy, and so is always facing the make-or-buy decision: Can this resource be acquired most efficiently from elsewhere within the firm, via social engineering or arm-twisting or </strong><em><strong>blat</strong></em><strong>, or is it better to seek budgetary authority to purchase it from outside? That make-or-buy decision is a powerful factor keeping businesses in capitalist market economies on their toes, and more efficient. And in capitalist market economies, factory-owning firms are surrounded by clouds of middlemen. In the Soviet Union, the broad market interfaces of individual factories and the clouds of middlemen were absent. As a consequence, its economy was grossly wasteful.</strong></p><p><strong>Though wasteful, material balance control is an expedient that pretty much all societies adopt during wartime. Then hitting a small number of specific targets for production becomes thexf highest priority. In times of total mobilization, command-and-control seems the best we can do. But do we wish a society in which all times are times of total mobilization?</strong></p><div><hr></div><p>And over on Twitter, Elf Sternberg reminds me that my thoughts on these issues are derivative from:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Francis Spufford</strong>: <em>Red Plenty </em>&lt;<a href="https://archive.org/details/redplenty0000spuf">https://archive.org/details/redplenty0000spuf</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Cosma Shalizi: </strong><em>In Soviet Union, Optimization Problem Solves <strong>You!</strong></em> &lt;<a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2012/05/30/in-soviet-union-optimization-problem-solves-you/">https://crookedtimber.org/2012/05/30/in-soviet-union-optimization-problem-solves-you/</a>&gt;</p></li></ul><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/elfsternberg/status/1587111445036093440&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;<span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@adamgurri</span> <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@delong</span> This reminds me of the brilliant Red Plenty by Francis Spufford, which I believe anyone who wants more detail on these paragraphs would enjoy.

It is also a somewhat puzzling aspect. After all, the really existing socialist economies were, to a kremlin, authoritarian: they, theoretically, at least, had no difficulty in suppressing consumption to promote investment. And the world as of 1990 was still a very capital-scarce one, with a high marginal return on investment.—at least in potential. But a gap of 5-to-1 in income and 8-to-1 in deployed-and-diffused technology? Yet that is what it was, in 1990, when the experiment was wound up.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share Brad DeLong's Grasping Reality</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video: <strong>Quantum Computing:</strong></h2><p><strong>Ian Cuttress</strong>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TechTechPotato">TechTechPotato</a>: ‘It's easy to consider Quantum Computing very far away, but in reality there are millions upon billions of quantum circuits being run every single day on Quantum Computers readily available in the cloud.

The more knowledge humans have, the longer it takes a budding researcher to get to the frontier, and thus to push things forward. In a paper provocatively titled, “The burden of knowledge and the death of the Renaissance man”, Mr Jones argued humanity’s growing knowledge would slow scientific progress and thus economic growth. More recent research has solidified this view…. The slowdown has spurred academics and policymakers looking to bolster scientific enterprise…. Breaking bad funding habits should make a difference.

Italian liberals were both political collaborators and also the architects of a state policy that favored austerity and “stability.” But abroad, liberal and conservative elites also had high hopes for fascism as a constructive force in world affairs. This was “technocratic-fascism”… understood, especially, in the 1920s as a force of order, offering a new set of solutions to the problem of capitalist governance and one which forward-thinking liberals and conservatives associated themselves….
