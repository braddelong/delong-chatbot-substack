There are two and only two regions in the world that have successfully a€oeconvergeda€D to 
leading-edge norms: Northwest and Southwestern Europe on the one hand, and the East Asian Pacific 
Rim on the other.

With respect to the Pacific Rim, originally the belief was that it was Japan that had done 
something speciala€”had taken the Hamilton-List model of development, modified it, and applied it 
super-successfully. Then it was Japan and the Four Tigers that had the secret sauce. But now we 
have added coastal China; Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand; anda€”perhapsa€”Indonesia. It is 
region-wide, in spite of substantial differences in policies and starting points, with the 
Philippines being the
very odd creature out in the region. This should give us pause, and should give us many clues as to 
what is essential and what is accidental in the full-convergence process:

Noah Smith: What Studwell Got Wrong'. a€~My favorite book about economic development is Joe 
Studwella€™ s How Asia Works. If you havena€™ t read this book, you should definitely remedy that. 
In the meantime, you can start with Scott Alexandera€™ s excellent summarya€!. How Asia Works^\ 
tells a coherent story about how countries get richa€!. Land reform: Forcibly buy up tenant farms 
from landlords and give it to the tenantsa€l. Export
discipline: Push companies to export instead of just selling domestically. Cut off support to 
companies that try to export and faila€!. Financial control: Push banks to support exporters 
instead of putting their money into real estate bubbles and the likea€l. Because ita€™ s so hard to 
test, the theory serves less as a tried-and-true policy prescription and more as a launching point 
for ideas about how to manage a developing economya€l. Studwell does make a few
mistakesa€!. The time and effort that Studwell puts into coming up with reasons why South Korea has 
done a bit better than Taiwan is probably wasted; South Korea simply has a slightly more expensive 
currencya€!. Studwella€™ s biggest mistake, however, is writing off Malaysiaa€!.. How Asia Works 
may have made a more general mistake by focusing only on failures when it came to Southeast Asian 
countries and contrasting these with successes in
Northeast  Asian countries .a€ I

Adam Tooze: Chartook: a€~Chartbook started as a free newsletter and I want very much to keep it 
that way. If you need to read Chartbook Newsletter for free, you are welcome to do so. If you 
cana€™ t afford a paid subscription, or if you read it in a context where paying subscriptions is 
inappropriate, I get it. You dona€™ t have to do anything. You will continue to receive the 
newsletter as before. But, writing the newsletter takes a lot of time and effort. I have to juggle 
it with all sorts
of other commitments. So, if you can afford to, if you think the Chartbook content is valuable, if

Laura Tyson & John Zysman: Americad€™ s Vital Chip Mission: a€~This yeara€™ s semiconductor 
shortages underscore the need for a comprehensive strategy to maintain a reliable supply of 
components that are now indispensable to both the economy and national security. A successful 
strategy will have four main componentsa€!. Competitive market conditions must prevail throughout 
the industry, because excessive market power in any one segment can jeopardize supply. The
system must also be resilient to shocks like fires, droughts, earthquakes, and geopolitical 
tensions and upheavals. And it must be secure in two senses: the US must maintain reliable access 
to cutting-edge chips and the means of producing them, and chip supplies need to be protected from 
threats like counterfeiting, theft, cyberattacks, and espionage. Finally, the supply must be 
sustainable, accounting for the significant environmental and energy costs of chip production. CRSS 
does not
mean national autonomy in the semiconductor industry. That goal would be neither feasible nor 
economically rationala€!. What CRSS does mean is that the US should cooperate closely with the 
European Union, Japan, Singapore, Israel, and others who form core parts of its secure supply base. 
CRSS also does not mean preventing China from purchasing or selling semiconductors on global 
markets, or from developing its own semiconductor industry in ways that do not violate global
trade and investment rules. Weaponizing trade and investment restrictions to thwart Chinaa€™ s 
long-run semiconductor ambitions will be costly and counterproductivea€!. There is a danger that 
generous fiscal support will end up subsidizing private investments that are already being 
planneda€!. Both basic and pre-competitive research in semiconductors is an increasingly borderless 
process, which means that the effectiveness of US outlays will depend on cooperation with allies and
participation by their companiesa€!. Finallya€l USa€! ability to prototype and scale innovations 
has been hampered by the a€oelab-to-fab valley of death.a€D Breakthrough projects that may be 
viable in research labs are often prohibitively expensive to demonstrate, leaving them starved of 
the private investment needed to achieve scale. A promising approach to address this problem is a 
pre-competitive public-private R&D partnerships!

Timothy Burke: Futures ofCrime and Punishment (Part V): a€~The question of why people might oppose 
a better future is the political problem that matters. Sometimes thata€™ s about a tangible, 
visible, relatively simple motive. Sometimes ita€™ s about a century-long cultural formation 
thata€™ s deeply nestled inside the everyday Eves of some group of people. Sometimes ita€™ s not a
