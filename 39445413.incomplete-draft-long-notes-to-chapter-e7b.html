In the Dover-Circle-Plus economies, at least, it did not:</p><ul><li><p>restore productivity growth to its pre-1975 pace,</p></li><li><p>rework the system of economic distribution so that government programs provided more support to the unlucky who had strong claims on public assistance,</p></li><li><p>rework the system of economic distribution so that government programs provided less support to those who were politically powerful and well-connected, </p></li><li><p>reunify the western alliance behind the civilizational project of liberty and democracy, or</p></li><li><p>restore moral order and discipline to rich, post-industrial societies.</p></li></ul><p>All it did, as I have said, was to widen the inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth. And yet it persisted, and was even triumphant as late as 2004, or perhaps even later.</p><p>Yingyi Qian points out that my failure to understand the attraction and the persistence of the neoliberal project substantially flaws the later chapters of my book.

But how it was that the social-democratic political-economic mode of... distribution? allocation?... could not be sustained for more than three decades in the North Atlantic while the neoliberal mode hangs on—that still surprises me.</p><p>And you can concede some valid elements of a neoliberal critique of social democracy without winding up at the right-neoliberal position of Reagan and Thatcher that the relative poverty of the poor is a feature of modern society rather than a bug. In my younger days I was a card-carrying “left-neoliberal”, after all. I believed in:</p><ul><li><p>a focus on generating a stable price-level, high-investment, high productivity-growth economy, </p></li><li><p>market means to social-democratic ends where appropriate, </p></li><li><p>an attack on rent-seeking of all kinds, and </p></li><li><p>a reliance on means-tested benefits to diminish the effect of wealth inequalities</p></li></ul><p>That seemed the obviously-right thing to do in the late 1980s and 1990s to return us to the days of the <em>trentes glorieuses</em>, and to assemble a durable political coalition to deal with the fact that an awful lot of people welcomed Thatcher and Reagan. It was a world in which a life-long Lenin apologist like Eric Hobsbawm could also write in his <em>Age of Extremes</em> that:</p><blockquote><p>There was considerable scope for applying the neo-liberal cleansing-agent to the encrusted hull of many a good ship 'Mixed Economy' with beneficial results. Even the British Left was eventually to admit that some of the ruthless shocks imposed on the British economy by Mrs Thatcher had probably been necessary. There were good grounds for some of the disillusion with state-managed industries and public administration that became so common in the 1980s…</p></blockquote><p>Now Ed Balls and I can whimper that the left-neoliberal correction to social democracy was within our grasped, and was in fact almost grasped—that what Gary Gerstle calls the New Deal Order and I call social democracy could have been stabilized via a left-neoliberal correction, rather than being followed, as it was, by a near-hegemonic Right-Neoliberal Order. We can whimper that only the fact that five Supreme Court justices were partisan Republicans in the U.S. in 2000 and that Nick Clegg was Nick Clegg kept us from advancing into the Broad Sunlit Uplands in the US and UK. </p><p>But that is not very convincing, is it? Especially since the stubborn persistence of right-neoliberalism now shading into ethno-fascism is present in nearly the entire OECD.</p><p>My view is that social democracy ought to work. But—even when in the left-neoliberal sheep's clothing that Clinton and Blair donned—it does not. It is not politically sustainable. And, indeed, it was not sustained. </p><p>The fact that I have a hard time believing it is not sustainable and understanding why it was not sustained points to a big gap in my understanding. Yingyi Qian is right in pinpointing this as a flaw in the book.</p><div><hr></div><p>3) Amanda Robb, “Anatomy of a Fake News Scandal”, <em>Rolling Stone</em> November 16, 2017 &lt;https:// www.rollingstone.com/feature/anatomy-of-a-fake-news-scandal-125877/&gt;.</p><p>4) Barack Obama, “2004 Democratic National Convention Speech”, <em>PBS Newshour</em> July 27, 2004 &lt;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/barack-obamas-keynote-address-at-the-2004-democraticnational-convention&gt;.</p><p>5) J.

One question I always ask Paul Krugman and company is: what happened to the influence of Milton Friedman? No one was a stronger anti-liquidationist than Milton Friedman.… The shift to "liquidationism" as the default policy view of a Republican economist (when Republicans were out of power, at least), seems to have happened remarkably quickly in one decade, the 2000s, and without analysis and without argument. How and why did this happen, that being a full-fledged Mellonian became "edgy" and "cool"?</p><p><strong>Scott Gosnell: </strong>I think it came swift on the heels of a Randian political moment. Where before, Austrian economics would get you a glance askance, in 2008, it would get you a $300+ bottle of wine at dinner with Paul Ryan.</p><p><strong>Brad DeLong: </strong>Touché... The Hayek-Hoover-Mellon-Marx axis was a remarkable thing among Republican economists... especially since nobody has ever been able to write down a coherent overinvestment business-cycle model...</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong><em>Hey, I answered that question at length some years back</em>&lt;<a href="https://t.co/MCuyiMwXCg">https://t.co/MCuyiMwXCg</a>&gt;: Friedman tried to save free-market economics from itself, admitting that the economy wasn’t self-correcting but arguing that a rule that didn’t sound Keynesian would let conservative avoid thinking about that…. But ultimately free-market Keynesian, even disguised with a monetarist mask, wasn’t sustainable.</p><p><strong>Jim Beller</strong>: Having his disciples throwing people out of airplanes was a bad look.</p><p><strong>Brad DeLong</strong>: But, Paul, as you note, Bernanke in 2002 and Mankiw in 2006 still saw Friedman as “the economist of the century” &lt;<a href="https://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/milton-friedman.html">https://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/milton-friedman.html</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="https://federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/">https://federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/</a>&gt;. They were fine with the “government should not interfere with the economy” and “whatever is the monetary policy that happens to stabilize aggregate demand is the true non-interfering ‘neutral’ monetary policy”. It was a con, yes, but it was a successful con. And it is not clear that it was wrong as a practical policy position…. JM Keynes (macro)-Henry Simons (antitrust)-AC Pigou (externalities) is not that far from what you or I believe, or what Milton Friedman believed—or, at least, would graciously concede in his old age in outdoor lunch in North Beach if I could get him off of his hobbyhorses of ‘k% rule’ &amp; ‘government failure is almost always certain to be worse than market failure.’</p><p>The way you put it in your 2013 piece is like this:</p><blockquote><p>If markets can go so wrong that they cause Great Depressions, how can you be a free-market true believer on everything except macro? And as American conservatism moved ever further right, it had no room for any kind of interventionism, not even the sterilized, clean-room interventionism of Friedman’s monetarism”.</p></blockquote><p>I think that is (a) right, (b) much too compressed, but (c) ignores the problem of “where do you stop?”</p><p>Having the government establish &amp; maintain a property-rights order &amp; enforce contracts is, after all, a form of “interference” to the anarcho-capitalists. And while there are some ACs who want a contract dispute between you and me resolved by me “hiring” my police force and you “hiring” ours and the two settling the dispute by the Final Argument of Kings—thus going all the way back to full feudalism as society’s organizing principle—most do not. Most stop being happy with police &amp; courts.</p><p>So why is police &amp; courts acceptable, while police &amp; courts &amp; demand management is not?</p><p>I think it has something to do with Schumpeter, von Hayek, and von Mises; the context of early–20th center Vienna; the idea that humans are individuals for whom private property and one-shot exchange are “natural” (as opposed to creatures that establish and cement societal bonds via ongoing reciprocal gift-exchange relationships); the philosophical position that all is for the best in this the best of all possible worlds; and the resulting theological belief that:</p><blockquote><p>the market giveth; the market taketh away; blessed be the name of the market…</p></blockquote><p>In short, I think you are right, but I do not understand why you are right.</p><p>And here I know I am out of my depth, and I want to call for people like Emma Rothschild and Glory Liu who are trained professionals to help here, for they she might be able to teacheth me the lesson…</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>14) Brad Setser, “Bernanke’s Global Savings Glut”, <em>Council on Foreign Relations</em> May 21, 2005 &lt;https://www.cfr.org/blog/bernankes-global-savings-glut&gt;.</p><p>15) The best overview is, I believe, Barry J.
