<h3>Things that went whizzing by that I want to remember...</h3><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>First:</h2><p>The world would have been much better advised fifteen months ago to, rather than listening to the infectious-disease community, WHO, &amp; CDC, to have simply observed: This thing evolved it batcaves. Avoid batcaves. Make sure that the respiratory environment in which you breathe is as close to being the exact opposite of a batcave as you can—ventilation, outdoors, distanced, masks:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Zeynep Tufekci</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Few Sentences That Explain Much of What Went Wrong With Our Pandemic Response</em>: ‘How could it be so wrong, even after more than a year?… Some of the founders of public health and the field of infectious control of diseases around the world made key errors and conflations around the turn of the 20th century. These errors essentially froze into tradition and dogma that went unchanged and uncorrected for more than a century, until a pandemic forced our hand…. Infection, which is easier at close range, was seen to be due to particles sprayed out of one’s mouth, which fell quickly to the ground but could land on people. The possibility that, even at close range, people were inhaling floating little particles (aerosols!) that could also travel farther, was discounted…. Charles Chapin… was also concerned that belief in airborne transmission, which he associated with miasma theories, would make people feel helpless and drop their guard against contact transmission. This was a mistake that would haunt infection control for the next century and more…. Of course, the data did not fit this theory. Infections were happening mostly indoors, not outdoors, whereas droplets would be indifferent to existing indoors or outdoors since gravity is the same in both. Infections were occurring at longer distances…. Superspreading was driving the pandemic…. Droplets aren’t very conducive to such superspreading. Scientists who understand all this tried to raise the alarms…. They were rebuffed for almost a year.&nbsp;Last fall, under fire, the WHO assigned reviews of this topic to the very people who had loudly proclaimed their opinions for many months that the virus was being spread via respiratory droplets…</p><p>LINK: &lt;<a href="https://www.theinsight.org/p/the-few-sentences-that-explain-much">https://www.theinsight.org/p/the-few-sentences-that-explain-much</a>&gt;</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-05-13-th?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNjg3OSwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzYxNzc4OTAsImlhdCI6MTYyMTIwODk4MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTQ3ODc0Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.Utd0SxQXuefYaGEf3ZzmW9cqBv2tOc4JMZ9u_WmHuHM&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/briefly-noted-for-2021-05-13-th?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNjg3OSwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzYxNzc4OTAsImlhdCI6MTYyMTIwODk4MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTQ3ODc0Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.Utd0SxQXuefYaGEf3ZzmW9cqBv2tOc4JMZ9u_WmHuHM"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>One Video</h2><p><strong>Bob Litan</strong>: <em>An Economist Walks into a Bar</em>&lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SkoG9FWP4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SkoG9FWP4</a>&gt;:</p><div id="youtube2-4SkoG9FWP4" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;4SkoG9FWP4&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4SkoG9FWP4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div><hr></div><h2>Very Briefly Noted:</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Ben Reinhardt</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Shifting the Tmpossible to the Tnevitable: A Private ARPA User Manual</em>&lt;<a href="https://benjaminreinhardt.com/parpa">https://benjaminreinhardt.com/parpa</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Max Levy</strong>:&nbsp;<em>This Is Your Brain Under Anesthesia</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-your-brain-under-anesthesia/">https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-your-brain-under-anesthesia/</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Solimo</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Espresso Capsules</em>&nbsp;&lt;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Brand-Espresso-Compatible-Nespresso/dp/B089GQ2HCW/">https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Brand-Espresso-Compatible-Nespresso/dp/B089GQ2HCW/</a>&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong>Roastesso</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Sunset Decaf Coffee Capsules for Nespresso Machines</em>&lt;<a href="https://www.roastesso.com/products/sunset-decaf">https://www.roastesso.com/products/sunset-decaf</a>&gt;</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>Paragraphs:</h2><p>For a century now the forces that are now Likud and the forces that are now Hamas have chosen violence in the Middle East—glory in it, and think that it strengthens them vis-a-vis their own internal political opponents, as long as each can <em>pretend to its core supporters</em> that it is protecting them rather than endangering them by amplifying violence. We almost got this under control in 1995. But then Israeli rightists assassinated Yitzhak Rabin, and Likud and Hamas both managed to choose violence and make chaos their ladders to victory over their internal political adversaries.

The incompetence and viciousness of Jerusalem’s Jewish authorities and the government of Benjamin Netanyahu…. Israeli police responded… with brutal force, and then, inexplicably, by attacking the Al-Aqsa Mosque—the third holiest site in Islam—with tear gas, rubber-tipped bullets, and stun grenades, during Ramadan prayers…. Hamas responded with rockets…. Israel responded by murdering Gazan civilians. And now here we are…. Hamas has no more monopoly on resistance to Israeli occupation or apartheid than Netanyahu’s Likud Party and its ethnonationalist allies do on the fight for the survival of Jews. Both can and must be opposed. The other is to keep in mind the humanity of the individuals involved…. Only a common understanding of one another’s humanity and the rights that humanity entails will ultimately end it.

Recurring economic crises are nothing but the consequence of attempts, despite all the teachings of experience and all the warnings of the economists, to stimulate economic activity by means of additional credit…’ Note that this does not just apply to fiat money produced by a government. This applies to all financial market asset valuations in excess of capital cost of production (or perhaps the value of the inventions of the gigantic Krell-like brain of John Galt). They are, to von Mises, all cheats. Thus Von Mises loathes fractional reserve bankers and IPO-mongers as much as he loathes modern central bank chairs. The “value equals cost of production constant returns to scale” viewpoint is an astonishingly powerful set of blinders to wear.
